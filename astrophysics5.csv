"Title:
Inflationary Potential Reconstruction for a WMAP Running Power Spectrum","
Abstract: The first year WMAP measurement of the CMB temperature anisotropy is
intriguingly consistent with a larger running of the inflationary scalar
spectral index than would be expected for single-field inflation. We revisit
the issue of a large running spectral index, first by reexamining the evidence
from the data, and then by reconstructing the inflationary potential, using an
improved method based upon the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We note that a
spectrum which runs only over 1.5 decades of k space provides as good a fit to
the CMB data as one which runs at all k, that significant evidence for running
comes from multipoles l near 40, and that large running gives a better fit than
a flat spectrum primarily if the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is large, r ~ 0.5,
and the field values are at the Planck scale. This allows one to break the
large degeneracy of potentials which would be consistent with the scalar power
alone. Large running, should it be confirmed, is thus linked to a high scale of
inflation and the possibility of seeing effects of tensor modes in the CMB and
Planck-scale physics. Nevertheless, we show that the reconstructed inflaton
potential is well-described by a renormalizable potential whose quantum
corrections are under control despite the large field values.

"Title:
The Origin of the Initial Mass Function","
Abstract: We review recent advances in our understanding of the origin of the initial
mass function (IMF). We emphasize the use of numerical simulations to
investigate how each physical process involved in star formation affects the
resulting IMF. We stress that it is insufficient to just reproduce the IMF, but
that any successful model needs to account for the many observed properties of
star forming regions including clustering, mass segregation and binarity.
Fragmentation involving the interplay of gravity, turbulence, and thermal
effects is probably responsible for setting the characteristic stellar mass.
Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs can form through the fragmentation of dense
filaments and disks, possibly followed by early ejection from these dense
environments which truncates their growth in mass. Higher-mass stars and the
Salpeter-like slope of the IMF are most likely formed through continued
accretion in a clustered environment. The effects of feedback and magnetic
fields on the origin of the IMF are still largely unclear. Lastly, we discuss a
number of outstanding problems that need to be addressed in order to develop a
complete theory for the origin of the IMF.

"Title:
Annihilation Emission from the Galactic Black Hole","
Abstract: Both diffuse high energy gamma-rays and an extended electron-positron
annihilation line emission have been observed in the Galactic Center (GC)
region. Although X-ray observations indicate that the galactic black hole Sgr
A$^*$ is inactive now, we suggest that Sgr A$^*$ can become active when a
captured star is tidally disrupted and matter is accreted into the black hole.
As a consequence the galactic black hole could be a powerful source of
relativistic protons. We are able to explain the current observed diffuse
gamma-rays and the very detailed 511 keV annihilation line of secondary
positrons by $p-p$ collisions of such protons, with appropriate injection times
and energy. Relativistic protons could have been injected into the ambient
material if the black hole captured a 50M$_\odot$ star at several tens million
years ago. An alternative possibility is that the black hole continues to
capture stars with $\sim$1M$_\odot$ every hundred thousand years. Secondary
positrons produced by $p-p$ collisions at energies $\ga 30$ MeV are cooled down
to thermal energies by Coulomb collisions, and annihilate in the warm neutral
and ionized phases of the interstellar medium with temperatures about several
eV, because the annihilation cross-section reaches its maximum at these
temperatures. It takes about ten million years for the positrons to cool down
to thermal temperatures so they can diffuse into a very large extended region
around the Galactic center. A much more recent star capture may be also able to
account for recent TeV observations within 10 pc of the galactic center as well
as for the unidentified GeV gamma-ray sources found by EGRET at GC. The
spectral difference between the GeV flux and the TeV flux could be explained
naturally in this model as well.

"Title:
Exotic Low Density Fermion States in the Two Measures Field Theory:  Neutrino Dark Energy","
Abstract: We study a new field theory effect in the cosmological context in the Two
Measures Field Theory (TMT). TMT is an alternative gravity and matter field
theory where the gravitational interaction of fermionic matter is reduced to
that of General Relativity when the energy density of the fermion matter is
much larger than the dark energy density. In this case also the 5-th force
problem is solved automatically. In the opposite limit, where the magnitudes of
fermionic energy density and scalar field dark energy density become
comparable, nonrelativistic fermions can participate in the cosmological
expansion in a very unusual manner. Some of the features of such states in a
toy model of the late time universe filled with homogeneous scalar field and
uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos: neutrino mass increases as m ~
a^{3/2}; the neutrino gas equation-of-state approaches w=-1, i.e. neutrinos
behave as a sort of dark energy; the total (scalar field + neutrino)
equation-of-state also approaches w=-1; the total energy density of such
universe is less than it would be in the universe filled with the scalar field
alone. An analytic solution is presented. A domain structure of the dark energy
seems to be possible. We speculate that decays of the CLEP state neutrinos may
be both an origin of cosmic rays and responsible for a late super-acceleration
of the universe. In this sense the CLEP states exhibit simultaneously new
physics at very low densities and for very high particle masses.

"Title:
Clumpy shocks and the clump mass function","
Abstract: In this paper, we examine whether clumpy, colliding, flows could be
responsible for the clump mass functions that have been observed in several
regions of embedded star formation, which have been shown to be described by a
Salpeter type slope. The flows presented here, which comprise a population of
initially identical clumps and the calculations are performed with and without
the inclusion of self-gravity. When the shock region is at its densest, we find
that the clump mass spectrum is always well modelled by a Salpeter type slope.
This is true regardless of whether the self-gravity is included in the
simulations or not. In the non-self-gravitating simulations, this slope is
retained at lower Mach numbers (Mach 5 and 10) as the simulations progress past
the densest phase. In the simulations which include self-gravity, we find that
low Mach number runs yield a flatter mass function after the densest phase.
This is simply a result of increased coagulation due to gravitational collapse
of the flows. In the high Mach number runs (Mach 20) the Salpeter slope is
always lost. The self gravitating calculations also show that the sub-group of
gravitationally bound clumps in which star formation occurs, always contain the
most massive clumps in the population. The mass function of these bound star
forming clumps is not at all similar to the Salpeter type mass function
observed for stars in the field. We conclude that the clump mass function may
not only have nothing to do with gravity, but also nothing to do with the star
formation process and the resulting mass distribution of stars. This raises
doubt over the claims that the clump mass function is the origin of the stellar
IMF, for regions such as rho Oph, Serpens and the Orion B cloud.

"Title:
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Three Year Results:  Implications for Cosmology","
Abstract: A simple cosmological model with only six parameters (matter density, Omega_m
h^2, baryon density, Omega_b h^2, Hubble Constant, H_0, amplitude of
fluctuations, sigma_8, optical depth, tau, and a slope for the scalar
perturbation spectrum, n_s) fits not only the three year WMAP temperature and
polarization data, but also small scale CMB data, light element abundances,
large-scale structure observations, and the supernova luminosity/distance
relationship. Using WMAP data only, the best fit values for cosmological
parameters for the power-law flat LCDM model are (Omega_m h^2, Omega_b h^2, h,
n_s, tau, sigma_8) = 0.1277+0.0080-0.0079, 0.02229+-0.00073, 0.732+0.031-0.032,
0.958+-0.016, 0.089+-0.030, 0.761+0.049-0.048). The three year data
dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six dimensional parameter space.
Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power law
spectrum, the WMAP data_alone_ require dark matter, and favor a spectral index
that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant
spectrum (n_s=1, r=0). Models that suppress large-scale power through a running
spectral index or a large-scale cut-off in the power spectrum are a better fit
to the WMAP and small scale CMB data than the power-law LCDM model; however,
the improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only Delta chi^2 = 3 for 1 extra
degree of freedom. The combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yields
significant constraints on the geometry of the universe, the equation of state
of the dark energy, the gravitational wave energy density, and neutrino
properties. Consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, we
detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in the CMB maps.

Gamma rays from dark matter annihilation in the Draco and observability  at ARGO","
Abstract: The CACTUS experiment recently observed a gamma ray excess above 50 GeV from
the direction of the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Considering that Draco is
dark matter dominated the gamma rays may be generated through dark matter
annihilation in the Draco halo. In the framework of the minimal supersymmetric
extension of the standard model we explore the parameter space to account for
the gamma ray signals at CACTUS. We find that the neutralino mass is
constrained to be approximately in the range between 100 GeV ~ 400 GeV and a
sharp central cuspy of the dark halo profile in Draco is necessary to explain
the CACTUS results. We then discuss further constraints on the supersymmetric
parameter space by observations at the ground based ARGO detector. It is found
that the parameter space can be strongly constrained by ARGO if no excess from
Draco is observed above 100 GeV.

Galactic Planetary Nebulae with Wolf-Rayet Nuclei III. Kinematical  Analysis of a Large Sample of Nebulae","
Abstract: Expansion velocities (Vexp) of different ions and line widths at the base of
the lines are measured and analyzed for 24 PNe with [WC]-type nuclei (WRPNe), 9
PNe ionized by WELS (WLPNe) and 14 ordinary PNe. A comparative study of the
kinematical behavior of the sample clearly demonstrates that WRPNe have in
average 40-45% larger Vexp, and possibly more turbulence than WLPNe and
ordinary PNe. WLPNe have velocity fields very much alike the ones of ordinary
PNe, rather than the ones of WRPNe. All the samples (WRPNe, WLPNe and ordinary
PNe) show expansion velocities increasing with age indicators, for example
<Vexp> is larger for low-density nebulae and also it is larger for nebulae
around high-temperature stars. This age effect is much stronger for evolved
WRPNe, suggesting that the [WC] winds have been accelerating the nebulae for a
long time, while for non-WRPNe the acceleration seems to stop at some point
when the star reaches a temperature of about 90,000-100,000 K. Non-WR nebulae
reach a maximum Vexp < 30 km/s while evolved WRPNe reach maximum Vexp of about
40 km/s. For all kind of objects (WRPNe and non-WRPNe) it is found that in
average Vexp(N+) is slightly larger than Vexp(O++), indicating that the nebulae
present acceleration of the external shells.

Mass spectrum of primordial black holes from inflationary perturbation  in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld: a limit on blue spectra","
Abstract: The mass spectrum of the primordial black holes formed by density
perturbation in the radiation-dominated era of the Randall-Sundrum type-2
cosmology is given. The spectrum coincides with standard four-dimensional one
on large scales but the deviation is apparent on smaller scales. The mass
spectrum is initially softer than standard four-dimensional one, while after
accretion during the earliest era it becomes harder than that. We also show
expected extragalactic diffuse photon background spectra varying the initial
perturbation power-law power spectrum and give constraints on the blue spectra
and/or the reheating temperature. The most recent observations on the small
scale density perturbation from WMAP, SDSS and Lyman-\alpha Forest are used.
What we get are interpreted as constraints on the smaller scale inflation on
the brane connected to the larger one at the scale of Lyman-\alpha Forest. If
we set the bulk curvature radius to be 0.1 mm and assume the reheating
temperature is higher than 10^6 GeV, the scalar spectral index from the smaller
scale inflation is constrained to be n \lesssim 1.3. Typically, the constraints
are tighter than standard four-dimensional one, which is also revised by us
using the most recent observations.

Bulk Motion of Ultrarelativistic Conical Blazar Jets","
Abstract: Allowing for the conical shape of ultrarelativistic blazar jets with opening

accord with our earlier finding that such ultrarelativistic (Lorentz factor,
Gamma > 30) conical jets can reconcile the relatively slow apparent motions of
VLBI knots in TeV blazars with the extremely fast flows implied by their rapid
gamma-ray variability. This jet geometry also implies that de-projected jet
opening angles will typically be significantly underestimated from VLBI
measurements. In addition, de-projected jet lengths will be considerably
overestimated if high Lorentz factors and significant opening angles are not
taken into account.

dynamics of compact binaries, up to the second post-Newtonian order. As an
example, we compute the self-spin contribution to the luminosity due to
gravitational radiation of a compact binary consisting of galactic black holes,
the most important type of source for LISA. This translates to simply calculate
the residue of the instantaneous energy loss in the origin of the complex
parameter plane, which illustrates the power of the presented method.

"Title:
The redshift distribution of short gamma-ray bursts from dynamically  formed neutron star binaries","
Abstract: Short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) may arise from gravitational wave (GW)
driven mergers of double neutron star (DNS) systems. DNSs may be ""primordial""
or can form dynamically by binary exchange interactions in globular clusters
during core-collapse. For primordial binaries, the time delay between formation
and merger is expected to be short, tau~0.1 Gyr, implying that the redshift
distribution of merger events should follow that of star-formation. We point
out here that for dynamically formed DNSs, the time delay between
star-formation and merger is dominated by the cluster core-collapse time,
rather than by the GW inspiral time, yielding delays comparable to the Hubble
time. We derive the redshift distribution of merger events of dynamically
formed DNSs, and find it to differ significantly from that typically expected
for primordial binaries. The observed redshift distribution of SHBs favors
dynamical formation, although a primordial origin cannot be ruled out due to
possible detection biases. Future red-shift observations of SHBs may allow to
determine whether they are dominated by primordial or dynamically formed DNSs.

Relativistic statistical theory and generalized stosszahlansatz","
Abstract: We have investigated the proof of the $H$ theorem within a manifestly

our analysis, however, we have not considered the so-called deformed
mathematics as did in the above reference. As it happens in the nonrelativistic
limit, the molecular chaos hypothesis is slightly extended within the
$\kappa$-formalism, and the second law of thermodynamics implies that the
$\kappa$ parameter lies on the interval [-1,1]. It is shown that the
collisional equilibrium states (null entropy source term) are described by a
$\kappa$ power law generalization of the exponential Juttner distribution,
e.g., $f(x,p)\propto (\sqrt{1+

$\theta=\alpha(x)+\beta_\mu p^\mu$, where $\alpha(x)$ is a scalar, $\beta_\mu$

Stellar remnants in galactic nuclei: mass segregation","
Abstract: The study of how stars distribute themselves around a massive black hole
(MBH) in the center of a galaxy is an important prerequisite for the
understanding of many galactic-center processes. These include the observed
overabundance of point X-ray sources at the Galactic center, the prediction of
rates and characteristics of tidal disruptions of extended stars by the MBH and
of inspirals of compact stars into the MBH, the latter being events of high
importance for the future space borne gravitational wave interferometer LISA.
In relatively small galactic nuclei, hosting MBHs with masses in the range
10^5-10^7 Msun, the single most important dynamical process is 2-body
relaxation. It induces the formation of a steep density cusp around the MBH and
strong mass segregation, as more massive stars lose energy to lighter ones and
drift to the central regions. Using a spherical stellar dynamical Monte-Carlo
code, we simulate the long-term relaxational evolution of galactic nucleus
models with a spectrum of stellar masses. Our focus is the concentration of
stellar black holes to the immediate vicinity of the MBH. We quantify this mass
segregation for a variety of galactic nucleus models and discuss its
astrophysical implications. Special attention is given to models developed to
match the conditions in the Milky Way nucleus; we examine the presence of

dominant contributors to the 2-10 keV cosmic X-ray background. Our survey
covers 1 deg^2 of sky to 2-10 keV fluxes of 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and 2 deg^2
for fluxes of 3 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Our spectra reach to R <24 and have
produced redshifts for 438 hard X-ray sources. The vast majority of the 2-10
keV-selected sample are AGN with redshifts between 0.1 and 3. We find that few
sources at z<1 have high X-ray luminosities, reflecting a dearth of high-mass,
high-accretion-rate sources at low redshift, a result consistent with other
recent wide-area surveys. Half of our sources show significant obscuration,
with N_H>10^22 cm^-2, independent of unobscured luminosity. We classify 168
sources as emission-line galaxies; all are X-ray luminous objects with optical
spectra lacking both high-ionization lines and evidence of a non-stellar
continuum. The redshift distribution of these emission-line galaxies peaks at a
significantly lower redshift than does that of the sources we spectroscopically
identify as AGN. We conclude that few of these sources can be powered by
starburst activity. Stacking spectra for a subset of these sources, we detect
[Ne V] emission, a clear signature of AGN activity, confirming that the
majority of these objects are Seyfert 2s in which the high-ionization lines are
diluted by stellar emission. We find 33 objects lacking broad lines in their
optical spectra which have quasar X-ray luminosities (Lx>10^44 erg s^-1), the
largest sample of such objects identified to date. In addition, we explore 17

2Msec X-ray image centered on the GOODS-N field and a reprocessed VLA HDF
A-array data plus newly acquired VLA B-array data (rms=5.3microJy), we find
that radio galaxies (with spectroscopic redshifts; all have z>1) with
L(1.4GHz)>1E24 W/Hz typically have an X-ray detection rate of 72% (60% emit
hard X-rays suggesting an AGN origin for the radio emission) in contrast to 25%

1E24 W/Hz galaxies typically show compact rather than extended galaxy
morphology which is generally found for the less luminous radio emitting
galaxies but a few appear to be ongoing galaxy mergers. We also present SED
fitting for these luminous radio galaxies including Spitzer IRAC & MIPS 24um

small AGN population found by Pope et al. and others.
