Title:Evaluating the Evidence for Water World Populations using Mixture Models,"
Abstract:  Water worlds have been hypothesized as an alternative to photo-evaporation in
order to explain the gap in the radius distribution of Kepler exoplanets. We
explore water worlds within the framework of a joint mass-radius-period
distribution of planets fit to a sample of transiting Kepler exoplanets, a
subset of which have radial velocity mass measurements. We employ hierarchical
Bayesian modeling to create a range of ten mixture models that include multiple
compositional subpopulations of exoplanets. We model these subpopulations -
including planets with gaseous envelopes, evaporated rocky cores, evaporated
icy cores, intrinsically rocky planets, and intrinsically icy planets - in
different combinations in order to assess which combinations are most favored
by the data. Using cross-validation, we evaluate the support for models that
include planets with icy compositions compared to the support for models that
do not, finding broad support for both. We find significant population-level
degeneracies between subpopulations of water worlds and planets with primordial
envelopes. Among models that include one or more icy-core subpopulations, we
find a wide range for the fraction of planets with icy compositions, with a
rough upper limit of 50%. Improved datasets or alternative modeling approaches
may better be able to distinguish between these subpopulations of planets.

Title:NGC 5236's stars as tracers of arms and arm widths in spiral galaxies,"
Abstract:  Generally, identifying the spiral arms of a spiral galaxy is not a hard task.
However, defining the main characteristics, width and length of those structure
is not a common task. Previous studies have used different tracers: Star
clusters, Massers, H$\alpha$. It was until recently that individual stars were
used as tracers of spiral structures. The basic method of measuring the width
of spiral arms assumes a Gaussian distribution around the mean concentration,
either of gas or other tracer. In this work we use NGC 5236's stars as tracers.
We estimated the surface stellar density of arms and inter-arm regions to
measure the width of the arms. As a test case, this works focused on NGC 5236
(M83). We find that field stellar populations can trace the (two) main spiral
arms of NGC 5236. We find a correlation between the arm width and the
galactocentric radii, found using other tracers. The slope of the growth of the
width of the arm correlates with the morphological types of spiral galaxies. A
second finding of our study suggest the possible correlation between the width
of the arms and the corrotation radius, result that will be presented in a
follow up paper.

Title:A new look at local ultraluminous infrared galaxies: the atlas and radiative transfer models of their complex physics,"
Abstract:  We present the ultraviolet to submillimetre spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of the HERschel Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (HERUS) sample of
42 local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and fit them with a Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) code using the CYprus models for Galaxies and their
NUclear Spectra (CYGNUS) radiative transfer models for starbursts, active
galactic nucleus (AGN) tori and host galaxy. The Spitzer IRS spectroscopy data
are included in the fitting. Our bayesian SED fitting method takes comparable
time to popular energy balance methods but it is more physically motivated and
versatile. All HERUS galaxies harbor high rates of star formation but we also
find bolometrically significant AGN in all of the galaxies of the sample. We
estimate the correction of the luminosities of the AGN in the ULIRGs due to the
anisotropic emission of the torus and find that it could be up to a factor of
$\sim10$ for nearly edge-on tori. We present a comparison of our results with
the smooth torus model of Fritz et al. and the two-phase models of Siebenmorgen
et al. and SKIRTOR. We find that the CYGNUS AGN torus models fit significantly
better the SEDs of our sample compared to all other models. We find no evidence
that strong AGN appear either at the beginning or end of a starburst episode or
that starbursts and AGN affect each other. IRAS 01003-2238 and Mrk 1014 show
evidence for dual AGN in their SED fits suggesting a minimum dual AGN fraction
in the sample of 5%.

Title:Turbulence in Milky Way Star-Forming Regions Traced by Young Stars and Gas,"
Abstract:  The interstellar medium (ISM) is turbulent on all scales and in all phases.
In this paper, we study turbulence with different tracers in four nearby
star-forming regions: Orion, Ophiuchus, Perseus, and Taurus. We combine the
APOGEE-2 and Gaia surveys to obtain the full 6-dimensional measurements of
positions and velocities of young stars in these regions. The velocity
structure functions (VSFs) of the stars show a universal scaling of turbulence.
We also obtain H{\alpha} gas kinematics in these four regions from the
Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper. The VSFs of the H{\alpha} are more diverse compared
to the stars. In regions with recent supernova activities, they show
characteristics of local energy injections and higher amplitudes compared to
the VSFs of stars and of CO from the literature. Such difference in amplitude
of the VSFs can be explained by the different energy and momentum transport
from supernovae into different phases of the ISM, thus resulting in higher
levels of turbulence in the warm ionized phase traced by H{\alpha}. In regions
without recent supernova activities, the VSFs of young stars, H{\alpha}, and CO
are generally consistent, indicating well-coupled turbulence between different
phases. Within individual regions, the brighter parts of the H{\alpha} gas tend
to have a higher level of turbulence than the low-emission parts. Our findings
support a complex picture of the Milky Way ISM, where turbulence can be driven
at different scales and inject energy unevenly into different phases.

Title:A Triple Star Origin For T Pyx and Other Short-Period Recurrent Novae,"
Abstract:  Recurrent novae are star systems in which a massive white dwarf accretes
material at such a high rate that it undergoes thermonuclear runaways every 1 -
100 years. They are the only class of novae in which the white dwarf can grow
in mass, making some of these systems strong Type Ia supernova progenitor
candidates. Almost all known recurrent novae are long-period (P_orb > 12 hrs)
binary systems in which the requisite mass supply rate can be provided by an
evolved (sub-)giant donor star. However, at least two recurrent novae are
short-period (P_orb < 3 hrs) binaries in which mass transfer would normally be
driven by gravitational radiation at rates 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than
required. Here, we show that the prototype of this class -- T Pyxidis -- has a
distant proper motion companion and therefore likely evolved from a
hierarchical triple star system. Triple evolution can naturally produce exotic
compact binaries as a result of three-body dynamics, either by Kozai-Lidov
eccentricity cycles in dynamically stable systems or via mass-loss-induced
dynamical instabilities. By numerically evolving triple progenitors with
physically reasonable parameters forward in time, we show explicitly that the
inner binary can become so eccentric that mass transfer is triggered at
periastron, driving the secondary out of thermal equilibrium. We suggest that
short-period recurrent novae likely evolved via this extreme state, explaining
their departure from standard binary evolution tracks.

Title:Subaru HSC weak lensing of SDSS redMaPPer cluster satellite galaxies: Empirical upper limit on orphan fractions,"
Abstract:  Weak gravitational lensing directly probes the matter distribution
surrounding satellite galaxies in galaxy clusters. We measure the weak lensing
signal induced on the shapes of background galaxies around SDSS redMaPPer
cluster satellite galaxies, which have their central galaxies assigned with a
probability $P_{\rm cen}>0.95$ in the redshift range, $0.1\leq z\leq 0.33$. We
use the galaxy shapes from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey for this
purpose. We bin satellite galaxies by their distance from the cluster centre
and compare it to the signal around a control sample of galaxies which do not
reside in clusters but have similar colours and magnitudes. We explore the
effect of environmental processes on the dark matter mass around satellites. We
see hints of a difference in the mass of the subhalo of the satellite compared
to the halo masses of galaxies in our control sample, especially in the
innermost cluster-centric radial bin ($0.1<r<0.3$ [$h^{-1}\rm Mpc$]). For the
first time, we put an upper limit on the prevalence of orphan galaxies which
have entirely lost their dark matter halos with cluster-centric distances with
the help of our measurements. However, these upper limits could be relaxed if
there is substantial contamination in the satellite galaxy sample.

Title:Constraints on cosmic rays in the Milky Way circumgalactic medium from OVIII observations,"
Abstract:  We constrain the cosmic ray (CR) population in the circumgalactic medium
(CGM) of Milky Way by comparing the observations of absorption lines of OVIII
ion with predictions from analytical models of CGM : precipitation (PP) and
isothermal (IT) model. For a CGM in hydrostatic equilibrium, the introduction
of CR suppresses thermal pressure, and affects the OVIII ion abundance. We
explore the allowances given to the ratio of CR pressure to thermal pressure
($\rm{P}_{\rm{CR}}/\rm{P}_{\rm{th}}=\eta$), with varying boundary conditions,
CGM mass content, photoionization by extragalactic ultraviolet background and
temperature fluctuations. We find that the allowed maximum values of $\eta$ are
: $\eta\lesssim10$ in the PP model and $\eta\lesssim6$ in the IT model. We also
explore the spatial variation of $\eta$ : rising ($\eta=Ax$) or declining
($\eta=A/x$) with radius, where A is the normalization of the profiles. In
particular, the models with declining ratio of CR to thermal pressure fare
better than those with rising ratio with suitable temperature fluctuation
(larger $\sigma_{\rm ln T}$ for PP and lower for IT). The declining profiles
allow $A\lesssim8$ and $A\lesssim10$ in the case of IT and PP models,
respectively, thereby accommodating a large value of $\eta \,(\simeq 200)$ in
the central region, but not in the outer regions. These limits, combined with
the limits derived from $\gamma$-ray and radio background, can be useful for
building models of Milky Way CGM including CR population. However, the larger
amount of CR can be packed in cold phase which may be one way to circumvent
these constraints.

"Title:Widespread, strong outflows in XQR-30 quasars at the Reionisation epoch","
Abstract:  Luminous quasars powered by accretion onto billion solar mass black holes
already exist at the epoch of Reionisation, when the Universe was 0.5-1 Gyr
old. These objects likely reside in over-dense regions of the Universe, and
will grow to form today's giant galaxies. How their huge black holes formed in
such short times is debated, particularly as they lie above the local black
hole mass-galaxy dynamical mass correlation, thus following the black
hole-dominance growth path. It is unknown what slowed down the black hole
growth, leading towards the symbiotic growth observed in the local Universe,
and when this process started, although black hole feedback is a likely driver.
This deadlock is due to the lack of large, homogeneous samples of high-redshift
quasars with high-quality, broad-band spectroscopic information. Here we report
results from a VLT/X-shooter survey of 30 quasars at redshift 5.8$\le$z$\le$6.6
(XQR-30). About 50% of their spectra reveal broad blue-shifted absorption line
(BAL) throughs, tracing powerful ionised winds. The BAL fraction in z$\gtrsim$6
quasars is 2-3 times higher than in quasars at z~2-4.5. XQR-30 BAL quasars
exhibit extreme outflow velocities, up to 17% of the light speed, rarely
observed at lower redshift. These outflows inject large amounts of energy into
the galaxy interstellar medium, which can contrast nuclear gas accretion,
slowing down the black-hole growth. The star-formation rate in high-z quasar
hosts is generally $>$100 M$_\odot$/yr, so these galaxies are growing at a fast
rate. The BAL phase may then mark the beginning of significant feedback, acting
first on black hole growth and possibly later on galaxy growth. The red optical
colors of BAL quasars at z$\gtrsim$6 indeed suggest that these systems are
dusty and may be caught during an initial quenching phase of obscured
accretion.

Title:Stellar and black hole assembly in z<0.3 infrared-luminous mergers: intermittent starbursts vs. super-Eddington accretion,"
Abstract:  We study stellar and black hole mass assembly in a sample of 42
infrared-luminous galaxy mergers at z<0.3 by combining results from radiative
transfer modelling with archival measures of molecular gas and black hole mass.
The ratios of stellar mass, molecular gas mass, and black hole mass to each
other are consistent with those of massive gas-rich galaxies at z<0.3. The
advanced mergers may show increased black hole mass to stellar mass ratios,
consistent with the transition from AGN to ellipticals and implying substantial
black hole mass growth over the course of the merger. Star formation rates are
enhanced relative to the local main sequence, by factors of ~100 in the
starburst and ~1.8 in the host. The starburst star formation rates appear
distinct to star formation in the main sequence at all redshifts up to at least
z~5. Starbursts may prefer late-stage mergers, but are observed at any merger
stage. We do not find evidence that the starbursts in these low-redshift
systems substantially increase the total stellar mass, with a soft upper limit
on the stellar mass increase from starburst activity of about a factor of two.
In contrast, 12 objects show evidence for super-Eddington accretion, associated
with late-stage mergers, suggesting that many AGN in infrared-luminous mergers
go through a super-Eddington phase. The super-Eddington phase may increase
black hole mass by up to an order of magnitude at an accretion efficiency of
42+/-33% over a period of 44+/-22Myr. Our results imply that super-Eddington
accretion is an important black hole growth channel in infrared-luminous
galaxies at all redshifts.

Title:Evidence for the Late Arrival of Hot Jupiters in Systems with High Host-star Obliquities,"
Abstract:  It has been shown that hot Jupiters systems with massive, hot stellar
primaries exhibit a wide range of stellar obliquities. On the other hand, hot
Jupiter systems with low-mass, cool primaries often have stellar obliquities
close to zero. Efficient tidal interactions between hot Jupiters and the
convective envelopes present in lower-mass main sequence stars have been a
popular explanation for these observations. If this explanation is accurate,
then aligned systems should be older than misaligned systems. Likewise, the
convective envelope mass of a hot Jupiter's host star should be an effective
predictor of its obliquity. We derive homogeneous stellar parameters --
including convective envelope masses -- for hot Jupiter host stars with
high-quality sky-projected obliquity inferences. Using a thin disk stellar
population's Galactic velocity dispersion as a relative age proxy, we find that
hot Jupiter host stars with larger-than-median obliquities are older than hot
Jupiter host stars with smaller-than-median obliquities. The relative age
difference between the two populations is larger for hot Jupiter host stars
with smaller-than-median fractional convective envelope masses and is
significant at the 3.6-$\sigma$ level. We identify stellar mass, not convective
envelope mass, as the best predictor of stellar obliquity in hot Jupiter
systems. The best explanation for these observations is that many hot Jupiters
in misaligned systems arrived in the close proximity of their host stars long
after their parent protoplanetary disks dissipated. The dependence of observed
age offset on convective envelope mass suggests that tidal realignment
contributes to the population of aligned hot Jupiters orbiting stars with
convective envelopes.

Title:Imaging of the Quiet Sun in the Frequency Range of 20-80 MHz,"
Abstract:  Radio emission of the quiet Sun is considered to be due to thermal
bremsstrahlung emission of the hot solar atmosphere. The properties of the
quiet Sun in the microwave band have been well studied, and they can be well
described by the spectrum of bremsstrahlung emission. In the meter-wave and
decameter-wave bands, properties of the quiet Sun have rarely been studied due
to the instrumental limitations. In this work, we use the LOw Frequency ARray
(LOFAR) telescope to perform high quality interferometric imaging spectroscopy
observations of quiet Sun coronal emission at frequencies below 90~MHz. We
present the brightness temperature spectrum, and size of the Sun in the
frequency range of 20-80~MHz. We report on dark coronal regions with low
brightness temperature that persist with frequency. The brightness temperature
spectrum of the quiet Sun is discussed and compared with the bremsstrahlung
emission of a coronal model and previous quiet Sun observations.

Title:A novel framework for semi-Bayesian radial velocities through template matching,"
Abstract:  The detection and characterization of an increasing variety of exoplanets has
been in part possible thanks to the continuous development of high-resolution,
stable spectrographs, and using the Doppler radial-velocity (RV) method. The
Cross Correlation Function (CCF) method is one of the traditional approaches
for RV extraction. More recently, template matching was introduced as an
advantageous alternative for M-dwarf stars. In this paper, we describe a new
implementation of template matching within a semi-Bayesian framework, providing
a more statistically principled characterization of the RV measurements. In
this context, a common RV shift is used to describe the difference between each
spectral order of a given stellar spectrum and a template built from the
available observations. Posterior probability distributions are obtained for
the relative RV associated with each spectrum, after marginalizing with respect
to the continuum. This methodology was named S-BART: Semi-Bayesian Approach for
RVs with Template-matching, and it can be applied to HARPS and ESPRESSO. The
application of our method to HARPS archival observations of Barnard's star
allowed us to validate our implementation against HARPS-TERRA and SERVAL. Then,
we applied it to 33 ESPRESSO targets, evaluating its performance and comparing
it with the CCF method. We found a decrease in the median RV scatter of \sim
10\% and \sim 4\% for M- and K-type stars, respectively. S-BART yields more
precise RV estimates than the CCF method, particularly in the case of M-type
stars where a median uncertainty of \sim 15 cm/s is achieved over 309
observations. Further, we estimated the nightly zero point (NZP) of ESPRESSO,
finding a weighted NZP scatter below \sim 0.7 m/s. As this includes stellar
variability, photon noise, and potential planetary signals, it should be taken
as an upper limit of the RV precision attainable with ESPRESSO data.

Title:Inverse Multiview I: Multi-Calibrator inverse phase referencing for Microarcsecond VLBI Astrometry,"
Abstract:  Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry is a well established
technique for achieving $\pm10~\mu$as parallax accuracies at frequencies well
above 10~GHz. At lower frequencies, uncompensated interferometer delays
associated with the ionosphere play the dominant role in limiting the
astrometric accuracy. Multiview is a novel VLBI calibration method, which uses
observations of multiple quasars to accurately model and remove time-variable,
directional-dependent changes to the interferometer delay. Here we extend the
Multiview technique by phase referencing data to the target source (""inverse
Multiview"") and test its performance. Multiple observations with a four-antenna
VLBI array operating at 8.3~GHz show single-epoch astrometric accuracies near
$20~\mu$as for target-reference quasar separations up to about 7 degrees. This
represents an improvement in astrometric accuracy by up to an order of
magnitude compared to standard phase referencing.

Abstract:  Massive dense clumps in the Large Magellanic Cloud can be an important
laboratory to explore the formation of populous clusters. We report multiscale
ALMA observations of the N159W-North clump, which is the most CO-intense region
in the galaxy. High-resolution CO isotope and 1.3 mm continuum observations
with an angular resolution of $\sim$0.""25($\sim$0.07 pc) revealed more than
five protostellar sources with CO outflows within the main ridge clump. One of
the thermal continuum sources, MMS-2, shows especially massive/dense nature
whose total H$_2$ mass and peak column density are $\sim$10$^{4}$ $M_{\odot}$
and $\sim$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively, and harbors massive ($\sim$100
$M_{\odot}$) starless core candidates identified as its internal substructures.
The main ridge containing this source can be categorized as one of the most
massive protocluster systems in the Local Group. The CO high-resolution
observations found several distinct filamentary clouds extending southward from
the star-forming spots. The CO (1-0) data set with a larger field of view
reveals a conical-shaped, $\sim$30 pc long complex extending toward the
northern direction. These features indicate that a large-scale gas compression
event may have produced the massive star-forming complex. Based on the striking
similarity between the N159W-North complex and the previously reported other
two high-mass star-forming clouds in the nearby regions, we propose a
$""$teardrops inflow model$""$ that explains the synchronized, extreme star
formation across $>$50 pc, including one of the most massive protocluster

Title:Diagnostic functions of solar coronal magnetic fields from radio observations,"
Abstract:  In solar physics, it is a big challenge to measure the magnetic fields
directly from observations in the upper solar atmosphere, including the
chromosphere and corona. Radio observations are regarded as the most feasible
approach to diagnose the magnetic field in solar chromosphere and corona.
However, because of the complexity and diversity of the emission mechanisms,
the previous studies have only presented the implicit diagnostic functions of
the magnetic field for specific mechanism from solar radio observations. This
work collected and sorted out all methods for diagnosing coronal magnetic field
from solar radio observations, which are expressed as a set of explicit
diagnostic functions. In particular, this work supplemented some important
diagnostic methods missed in other reviews. This set of diagnostic functions
can completely cover all regions of the solar chromosphere and corona,
including the quiet region, active region and flaring source regions. At the
same time, it also includes incoherent radiation such as bremsstrahlung
emission of thermal plasma above the quiet region, cyclotron and
gyro-synchrotron emissions of magnetized hot plasma and mildly relativistic
nonthermal electrons above the active regions, as well as coherently plasma
emission around flaring source regions. Using this set of diagnostic functions
and the related broadband spectral solar radio imaging observations, we can
derive the magnetic fields of almost all regions in the solar atmosphere,which
may help us to make full use of the spectral imaging observations of the new
generation solar radio telescopes (such as MUSER, EVOSA and the future FASR,
etc.) to study the solar activities, and provide a reliable basis for the

Abstract:  We present a uniform analysis of all mid-infrared $R\approx90$ spectra of
field M5--T9 dwarfs obtained with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). The
sample contains 113 spectra out of which 12 belong to late-M dwarfs, 69 to L
dwarfs, and 32 to T dwarfs. Sixty-eight of these spectra are presented for the
first time. We measure strengths of the main absorption bands in the IRS
spectra, namely H$_2$O at 6.25 $\mu$m, CH$_4$ at 7.65 $\mu$m, NH$_3$ at 10.5
$\mu$m, and silicates over 8--11 $\mu$m. Water absorption is present in all
spectra and strengthens with spectral type. The onset of methane and ammonia
occurs at the L8 and T2.5 types, respectively, although ammonia can be
detectable as early as T1.5. Silicate absorption sets in at spectral type L2,
is on average the strongest in L4--L6 dwarfs, and disappears past L8. However,
silicate absorption can also be absent from the spectra at any L subtype. We
find a positive correlation between the silicate absorption strength and the
excess (deviation from median) near-infrared colour at a given L subtype, which
supports the idea that variations of silicate cloud thickness produce the
observed colour scatter in L dwarfs. We also find that variable L3--L7 dwarfs
are twice more likely to have above-average silicate absorption than
non-variables. The ensemble of results solidifies the evidence for silicate
condensate clouds in the atmospheres of L dwarfs, and for the first time
observationally establishes their emergence and sedimentation between effective
temperatures of $\approx$2000 K and $\approx$1300 K, respectively.

During the development and early science phase of the project (2018-2020), we
obtained about 170 maps of the entire solar disk in the 18-26 GHz band, filling
the observational gap in the field of solar imaging at these frequencies. These
solar images have typical resolutions in the 0.7-2 arcmin range and a
brightness temperature sensitivity <10 K. Accurate calibration adopting the
Supernova Remnant Cas A as a flux reference, provided typical errors <3% for
the estimation of the quiet-Sun level components and for active regions flux
measurements.
As a first early science result of the project, we present a catalog of radio
continuum solar imaging observations with Medicina 32-m and SRT 64-m radio
telescopes including the multi-wavelength identification of active regions,
their brightness and spectral characterization. The interpretation of the
observed emission as thermal bremsstrahlung components combined with
gyro-magnetic variable emission pave the way to the use of our system for

Title:Radial distribution of the carbonaceous nano-grains in the protoplanetary disk around HD 169142,"
Abstract:  HD 169142 is part of the class of (pre-)transitional protoplanetary disks
showing multiple carbon nanodust spectroscopic signatures (aromatic, aliphatic)
dominating the infrared spectrum. Precise constraints on the spatial
distribution and properties of carbonaceous dust particles are essential to
understanding the physics of the disk. The HD 169142 disk is seen almost
face-on and thus offers a unique opportunity to study the dust radial
evolution. We investigate the spatial distribution and properties of the
carriers of several dust aromatic emission features in the disk across a broad
spatial range (10-200 AU). We analysed imaging and spectroscopic observations
in the 8-12 microns range from VLT/VISIR, as well as adaptive optics
spectroscopic observations in the 3-4 microns range from VLT/NACO. The data
probes the spatial evolution of the 3.3, 8.6, and 11.3 microns aromatic bands.
To constrain the radial distribution of carbonaceous nano-grains, the
observations were compared to models using The Heterogeneous dust Evolution
Model for Interstellar Solids (THEMIS), integrated into the POLARIS radiative
transfer code by calculating the thermal and stochastic heating of
sub-micrometer dust grains. Our data show predominant nano-particle emission at

microns) in the HD 169142 disk. This unambiguously shows that carbonaceous
nano-grains dominate radiatively the infrared spectrum in most of the disk, as
suggested by previous studies. In order to account for both VISIR and NACO
emission maps, we show the need for aromatic particles distributed within the
disk from the outermost regions to a radius of 20 AU, corresponding to the
outer limit of the inner cavity derived from previous observations. In the
inner cavity, these aromatic particles might be present but their abundance
would then be significantly decreased.

Title:Development of an electron impact ion source with high ionization efficiency for future planetary missions,"
Abstract:  Ion sources using electron impact ionization (EI) methods have been widely
accepted in mass spectrometry for planetary exploration missions because of
their simplicity. Previous space-borne mass spectrometers were primarily
designed with the EI method using rhenium tungsten alloy filaments, enabling up
to 200 uA emission in typical cases. The emission level is desired to be
enhanced because the sensitivity of mass spectrometers is a critical
requirement for the future in situ mass spectrometry related to the measurement
of trace components in planetary samples. In this study, we developed a new
high-emission EI ion source using a Y2O3-coated iridium filament, which has a
lower work function than rhenium tungsten alloy. The size of the ion source was
30 mm * 26 mm * 70 mm, and its weight was 70 g. We confirmed that when
consuming 3.0 W power, the ion source emits more than 2 mA electrons, which is
10 times greater than the previous models electron emission level. Ionization
efficiency of the EI ion source is proportional to the amount of electron
emission, which implies our new model increased the ionization efficiency 10
times. We conducted performance tests on the prototype with the 3.0 W heating
condition, confirming a high ionization efficiency (10^4 nA/Pa). In addition,
we conducted endurance tests of the ion source and demonstrated the persistence
of the ionization efficiency for 30 min * 100 cycles.

Title:Reliability and limitations of inferring birth radii in the Milky Way disk,"
Abstract:  Recovering the birth radii of observed stars in the Milky Way is one of the
ultimate goals of Galactic Archaeology. One method to infer the birth radius
and the evolution of the ISM metallicity assumes a linear relation between the
ISM metallicity with radius at any given look-back time. Here we test the
reliability of this assumption by using 4 zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations from the NIHAO-UHD project. We find that one can infer precise
birth radii only when the stellar disk starts to form, which for our modeled
galaxies happens ~ 10 Gyr ago, in agreement with recent estimates for the Milky
Way. At later times the linear correlation between the ISM metallicity and
radius increases, as stellar motions become more ordered and the azimuthal
variations of the ISM metallicity start to drop. The formation of a central bar
and perturbations from mergers can increase this uncertainty in the inner and
outer disk, respectively.

Title:A surface constraint approach for solar sail orbits,"
Abstract:  In this paper, a surface geometric constraint approach is used in designing
the orbits of a solar sail. We solve the solar sail equation of motion by
obtaining a generalized Laplace-Runge-Lenz (LRL) vector with the assumption
that the cone angle is constant throughout the mission. A family of orbit
equation solutions can then be specified by defining a constraint equation that
relates the radial and polar velocities of the spacecraft and is dependent on
the geometry of the surface where the spacecraft is expected to move. The
proposed method is successfully applied in the design of orbits constrained on
cylinders and to displaced non-Keplerian orbits.

Title:Ringing the universe with cosmic emptiness: void properties through a combined analysis of stacked weak gravitational and Doppler lensing,"
Abstract:  An essential aspect of cosmic voids is that these underdense regions provide
complementary information about the properties of our Universe. Unlike dense
regions, voids are avoided by matter and are less contaminated by baryonic
processes. The first step to understanding the properties of cosmic voids is to
correctly infer their mass profiles. In the literature, various techniques have
been implemented. In this paper, we review them and implement a new technique
that is based on Doppler lensing. We use a relativistic $N$-body code,
\textsc{Gevolution}, to generate cosmological mass perturbations and implement
a three-dimensional ray-tracing technique, which follows the evolution of a
ray-bundles. We focus on the various properties of cosmic voids (e.g. void size
function, 2-point correlation function, and the density profile of voids), and
compare the results with their universal trends. We show that when weak-lensing
is combined with the Doppler lensing we obtain even tighter constraints than
weak-lensing alone. We also obtain better agreement between density profiles
within central parts of voids inferred from lensing and density profiles
inferred from halo tracers. The implication of the result relevant to the
ongoing and prospective low-redshift spectroscopic surveys is briefly
discussed.

Title:Relationship between Gamma-ray loudness and X-ray spectra of Radio Galaxies,"
Abstract:  The {\it Fermi} satellite has detected $\sim$60 radio galaxies (RGs). In this
study, we investigate the difference in the properties of X-ray spectra between
GeV-loud RGs and GeV-quiet RGs. Our sample comprises 68 objects: 36 RGs
detected with {\it Fermi} and 32 RGs not detected with gamma rays. We analyzed
the X-ray spectra of these 68 objects using data from the {\it XMM-Newton},
{\it Chandra}, {\it NuSTAR}, and {\it Swift} satellites. Our results show that
most GeV-loud RGs do not exhibit significant absorption, while $\sim$50\% of
the GeV-quiet RGs exhibit significant absorption. This suggests that the jet of
GeV-loud RGs is viewed from a small angle, and thus the emission is not easily
blocked by the torus. Moreover, we reported that RGs with a heavy absorption
are mostly in the X-ray luminosity range of $10^{43}-10^{45}$erg s$^{-1}$;
however, few RGs with lower and higher luminosity suffer from heavy absorption.
This is the same trend as that of Seyfert galaxies.

Title:Study of maximum electron energy of sub-PeV pulsar wind nebulae by multiwavelength modelling,"
Abstract:  Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported
discovery of 12 ultrahigh-energy (UHE; $\mathrm{\varepsilon} \ge 100$ TeV)
gamma-ray sources located in the Galactic plane. Few of these UHE gamma-ray
emitting regions are in spatial coincidence with pulsar wind nebula (PWN)
objects. We consider a sample of five sources; two of them are LHAASO sources
(LHAASO J1908+0621 and LHAASO J2226+6057) and the remaining three are GeV-TeV
gamma-ray emitters. In addition, their X-ray and radio observations or upper
limits are also available for these objects. We study multiwavelength radiation
from these sources by considering a PWN origin, where the emission is powered
by time-dependent spin-down luminosity of the associated pulsars. In this one
zone, time-dependent leptonic emission model, the electron population is
calculated at different times under the radiative (synchrotron and
inverse-Compton) and adiabatic cooling. We estimate the upper limits on the
minimum Lorentz factor of the electrons and it also infers the minimum value of
the pair-multiplicity of charged pairs. Further, the maximum value of the
electron Lorentz factor is estimated by the maximum observed photon energy in
the sub-PeV range. In the special case of HESS J1640-465, a higher energy
density of the stellar photons is required to fit gamma-ray data compared to
the standard IR/CMB background used in the PWNe modelling. We also discuss the
possible modification in the model parameters, if the escape of particles is
allowed from the pulsar wind nebula. For example, we consider LHAASO 1908+0621
and discuss qualitatively the impact of escape of particles from this source.

"Title:Isotropization and Evolution of Energy-Containing Eddies in Solar Wind Turbulence: Parker Solar Probe, Helios 1, ACE, WIND, and Voyager 1","
Abstract:  We examine the radial evolution of correlation lengths perpendicular
(\(\lambda_C^{\perp}\)) and parallel (\(\lambda_C^{\parallel}\)) to the
magnetic-field direction, computed from solar wind magnetic-field data measured
by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during its first eight orbits, Helios 1, Advanced
Composition Explorer (ACE), WIND, and Voyager 1 spacecraft. Correlation lengths
are grouped by an interval's alignment angle; the angle between the
magnetic-field and solar wind velocity vectors (\(\Theta_{\rm BV}\)). Parallel
and perpendicular angular channels correspond to angles
\(0^{\circ}~<~\Theta_{\rm BV}~<~40^{\circ}\) and \(50^{\circ}~<~\Theta_{\rm
BV}~<~90^{\circ}\), respectively. We observe an anisotropy in the inner
heliosphere within 0.40~au, with \(\lambda_C^{\parallel} / \lambda_C^{\perp}
\approx 0.75\) at 0.10~au. This anisotropy reduces with increasing heliocentric
distance and the correlation lengths roughly isotropize within 1~au. Results
from ACE and WIND support a reversal of the anisotropy, such that
\(\lambda_C^{\parallel} /\lambda_C^{\perp} \approx 1.29\) at 1~au. The ratio
does not appear to change significantly beyond 1~au, although the small number
of parallel intervals in the Voyager dataset precludes unambiguous conclusions
from being drawn. This study provides insights regarding the radial evolution
of the large, most energetic interacting turbulent fluctuations in the
heliosphere. We also emphasize the importance of tracking the changes in
sampling direction in PSP measurements as the spacecraft approaches the Sun,
when using these data to study the radial evolution of turbulence. This can
prove to be vital in understanding the more complex dynamics of the solar wind
in the inner heliosphere and can assist in improving related simulations.

of 1819 galaxies in the NASA Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We further
characterized these systems using optical spectroscopic diagnostics, WISE IR
color selection criteria, and spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Of
the 48 candidates, eight were identified as AGNs from optical emission lines,
two were identified by their IR colors, and 28 were identified through spectral
energy decomposition. Observational biases of each selection method are
discussed in connecting these AGNs subsamples to another. By selecting AGNs
based on UV variability, we also identified six low-mass AGNs candidates, all
of which would have been missed by spectroscopic selection.

Abstract:  We present the first very-long-baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations
of the blazar OJ287 carried out jointly with the Global Millimeter VLBI Array
(GMVA) and the phased Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at
3.5 mm on April 2, 2017. Participation of phased-ALMA not only has improved the
GMVA north-south resolution by a factor of ~3, but also has enabled fringe
detection with signal-to-noise ratios up to 300 at baselines longer than 2
G{\lambda}. The high sensitivity has motivated us to image the data with the
newly developed regularized maximum likelihood imaging methods, revealing the
innermost jet structure with unprecedentedly high angular resolution. Our
images reveal a compact and twisted jet extending along the northwest direction
with two bends within the inner 200 {\mu}as that resembles a precessing jet in
projection. The component at the southeastern end shows a compact morphology
and high brightness temperature, and is identified as the VLBI core. An
extended jet feature that lies at ~200 {\mu}as northwest of the core shows a
conical shape in both total and linearly polarized intensity, and a bimodal
distribution of the linear polarization electric vector position angle. We
discuss the nature of this feature by comparing our observations with models
and simulations of oblique and recollimation shocks with various magnetic field
configurations. Our high-fidelity images also enabled us to search for possible
jet features from the secondary supermassive black hole (SMBH) and test the

Title:Origin and evolution of dust-obscured galaxies in galaxy mergers,"
Abstract:  Dust Obscured Galaxies (DOGs), which are observationally characterized as
faint in the optical and bright in the infrared, are the final stage of galaxy
mergers and are essential objects in the evolution of galaxies and active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, the relationship between torus-scale gas
dynamics around AGNs and DOGs lifetime remain unclear. We obtained evolution of
the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a galaxy merger system with AGN
feedback, from post-processed pseudo-observations based on an N-body/Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation. We focused on a late stage merger of
two identical galaxies with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of 10$^8$
M$_\odot$. We found that the infrared luminosity of the system reaches ultra-
and hyper-luminous infrared galaxy classes (10$^{12}$ and 10$^{13}$ L$_\odot$,
respectively). The DOGs phase corresponds to a state in which the AGNs are
buried in dense gas and dust, with the infrared luminosity exceeding 3.3
$\times$ 10$^{12}$ L$_\odot$. We also identified the sub-categories of DOGs,
namely bump and power-law DOGs from the SEDs and their evolution. The bump DOGs
tend to evolve to power-law DOGs on several Myrs. We found that contribution
from the hot dust around the nucleus in the infrared radiation is essential for
identifying the system as a power-law DOG; the gas and dust distribute
non-spherically around the nucleus, therefore, the observed properties of DOGs
depend on the viewing angle. In our model, the lifetime of merger-driven DOGs
is less than 4 Myrs, suggesting that the observed DOGs phase is a brief aspect
of galaxy mergers.

Title:Fisher matrix for the one-loop galaxy power spectrum: measuring expansion and growth rates without assuming a cosmological model,"
Abstract:  We introduce a methodology to extend the Fisher matrix forecasts to mildly
non-linear scales without the need of selecting a cosmological model. We make
use of standard non-linear perturbation theory for biased tracers complemented
by counterterms, and assume that the cosmological distances can be measured
accurately with standard candles. Instead of choosing a specific model, we
parametrize the linear power spectrum and the growth rate in several $k$ and
$z$ bins. We show that one can then obtain model-independent constraints of the
expansion rate $E(z)=H(z)/H_0$ and the growth rate $f(k,z)$, besides the bias
functions. We apply the technique to both Euclid and DESI public specifications
in the range $0.6\le z \le 1.8$ and show that the gain in precision when going
from $k_{\rm max} = 0.1$ to $0.2\,h$/Mpc is around two- to threefold, while it
reaches four- to ninefold when extending to $k_{\rm max} = 0.3\,h$/Mpc. In
absolute terms, with $k_{\rm max}=0.2\,h/$Mpc, one can reach high precision on
$E(z)$ at each $z$-shell: 8-10% for DESI with $\Delta z=0.1$, 5-6% for Euclid
with $\Delta z=0.2-0.3$. This improves to 1-2% if the growth rate $f$ is taken
to be $k$-independent. The growth rate itself has in general much weaker
constraints, unless assumed to be $k$-independent, in which case the gain is
similar to the one for $E(z)$ and uncertainties around 5-15% can be reached at
each $z$-bin. We also discuss how neglecting the non-linear corrections can
have a large effect on the constraints even for $k_{\rm max}=0.1\,h/$Mpc,
unless one has independent strong prior information on the non-linear
parameters.

Title:Frequency analysis of KIC 1573174 : shedding light on the nature of HADS stars,"
Abstract:  We propose that KIC 1573174 is a quadruple-mode $\delta$ Scuti star with
pulsation amplitudes between those of the HADS (high-amplitude Delta Scuti
star) group and average low-amplitude pulsators. The radial modes detected in
this star provide a unique opportunity to exploit asteroseismic techniques up
to their limits. Detailed frequency analysis is given for the light curve from
the Kepler mission. The variation of the light curve is dominated by the
strongest mode with a frequency of F0 = 7.3975 $\rm{d^{-1}}$, as shown by
Fourier analysis of long cadence data (Q1-Q17, spanning 1460 days), indicating
that the target is a $\delta$ Scuti star. The other three independent modes
with F1 = 9.4397 d$^{-1}$, F2 = 12.1225 d$^{-1}$ and F3 = 14.3577 d$^{-1}$,
have ratios of $P_{1}$ / $P_{0}$, $P_{2}$ / $P_{0}$ and $P_{3}$ / $P_{0}$
estimated as 0.783, 0.610 and 0.515, which indicate that KIC 1573174 is a
quadruple-mode $\delta$ Scuti star. A different approach has been used to
determine the $O-C$ through the study of phase modulation. The change of period
$(1/P)~dP/dt$ is obtained resulting in $-1.14 \times 10^{-6}~\text{yr}^{-1}$
and $-4.48 \times 10^{-6}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ for F0 and F1 respectively. Based on
frequency parameters (i.e., F0, F1, F2, and F3), a series of theoretical models
were conducted by employing the stellar evolution code MESA. The ratio of
observed $f_{1}/f_{2}$ is larger than that of the model, which may be caused by
the rotation of the star. We suggest high-resolution spectral observation is
highly desired in the future to further constrain models.

stellar disks of the Milky Way galaxy we use a complete sample of 278,228 red
giant branch (RGB) stars distributed in a cylinder, centered at the Sun with a
1 kpc radius and half-height of 0.5 kpc. We determine separately the
kinematical properties of RGB stars for each Galactic hemisphere in search for
possible asymmetries. The kinematical properties of the RGB stars reveal the
existence of two kinematically distinct components: the thin disk with mean
velocities ${V_R}, {V_{\phi}}, {V_Z}$ of about -1, -239, 0 km s$^{-1}$
correspondingly and velocity dispersions $\sigma_R, \sigma_{\phi}, \sigma_Z$ of

of about +1, -225, 0 km s$^{-1}$, and velocity dispersions of 49, 35, and 22 km
s$^{-1}$. We find that up to 500 pc height above/below the galactic plane,
Thick disk stars comprise about half the stars of the disk. Such high amount of
RGB stars with Thick disk kinematics points at the secular evolution scenario
origin for the Thick disk of the Milky Way galaxy.

Title:A Speed Bump: SN 2021aefx Shows that Doppler Shift Alone can Explain Early-Excess Blue Flux in Some Type Ia Supernovae,"
Abstract:  We present early-time photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type
Ia Supernova (SN Ia) 2021aefx. The early time u-band light curve shows an
excess flux when compared to normal SNe Ia. We suggest that the early-excess
blue flux may be due to a rapid change in spectral velocity in the first few
days post explosion, produced by the emission of the Ca II H&K feature passing
from the u to the B bands on the time scale of a few days. This effect could be
dominant for all SNe Ia which have broad absorption features and early-time
velocities over 25,000 km/s. It is likely to be one of the main causes of
early-excess u-band flux in SNe Ia which have early-time high-velocities. This
effect may also be dominant in the UV filters, as well as in places where the
SN spectral energy distribution is quickly rising to longer wavelengths. The
rapid change in velocity can only produce a monotonic change (in flux-space) in
the u-band. For objects which explode at lower velocities, and have a more
structured shape in the early-excess emission, there must also be an additional
parameter producing the early-time diversity. More early time observations, in
particular early spectra, are required to determine how prominent this effect
is within SNe Ia.

Abstract:  We report the discovery of a highly circularly polarized, variable,
steep-spectrum pulsar in the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
(ASKAP) Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) survey. The pulsar is located
about $1^\circ$ from the center of the Large Magellanic Cloud, and has a
significant fractional circular polarization of $\sim$20%. We discovered
pulsations with a period of 322.5 ms, dispersion measure (DM) of 157.5 pc
cm$^{-3}$, and rotation measure (RM) of $+456$ rad m$^{-2}$ using observations
from the MeerKAT and the Parkes telescopes. This DM firmly places the source,
PSR J0523$-$7125, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This RM is extreme
compared to other pulsars in the LMC (more than twice that of the largest
previously reported one). The average flux density of $\sim$1 mJy at 1400 MHz
and $\sim$25 mJy at 400 MHz places it among the most luminous radio pulsars
known. It likely evaded previous discovery because of its very steep radio
spectrum (spectral index $\alpha \approx -3$, where $S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$)
and broad pulse profile (duty cycle $\gtrsim35$%). We discuss implications for
searches for unusual radio sources in continuum images, as well as
extragalactic pulsars in the Magellanic Clouds and beyond. Our result
highlighted the possibility of identifying pulsars, especially extreme pulsars,
from radio continuum images. Future large-scale radio surveys will give us an
unprecedented opportunity to discover more pulsars and potentially the most
distant pulsars beyond the Magellanic Clouds.

Title:Constraints on Explosion Timescale of Core-Collapse Supernovae Based on Systematic Analysis of Light Curves,"
Abstract:  Explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae is not fully understood yet.
In this work, we give constraints on the explosion timescale based on $^{56}$Ni
synthesized by supernova explosions. First, we systematically analyze
multi-band light curves of 82 stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) to obtain
bolometric light curves, which is among the largest samples of the bolometric
light curves of SESNe derived from the multi-band spectral energy distribution.
We measure the decline timescale and the peak luminosity of the light curves
and estimate the ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$) and $^{56}$Ni mass ($M_{\rm Ni}$)
to connect the observed properties with the explosion physics. We then carry
out one-dimensional hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis calculations, varying the
progenitor mass and the explosion timescale. From the calculations, we show
that the maximum $^{56}$Ni mass that $^{56}$Ni-powered SNe can reach is
expressed as $M_{\rm Ni} \lesssim 0.2 \ M_{\rm ej}$. Comparing the results from
the observations and the calculations, we show that the explosion timescale
shorter than 0.3 sec explains the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of the majority of
the SESNe.

Abstract:  I analyzed All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) Sky Patrol data
of ES Dra and classified it to be a Z Cam star with VY Scl-type fading
episodes. An analysis of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
observations showed that this object shows shallow eclipses and that the
orbital period is 0.17749895(17) d. Negative superhumps with a period of
0.167830(2) d and the beat phenomenon between the period of negative superhumps
and the orbital period were detected in the TESS data between 2020 January and
March. The orbital profile systematically varied depending on the beat phase
and eclipses were missing in some phases. The eclipses in ES Dra were grazing
and the disk was probably not eclipsed in some phases depending on the
orientation of the tilted disk. These observations added a support to the
interpretation of the precessing, tilted disk as the origin of negative
superhumps. Negative superhumps disappeared 4 d before the VY Scl-type fading
started. It was likely that the mass-transfer rate quickly dropped when
negative superhumps disappeared and the decline of the total luminosity of the
disk took 4 d. This provides a measurement of the time-scale of the response of
the disk against a sudden decrease of the mass transfer in a VY Scl star.
Although one of standstills in ES Dra was terminated by brightening, the
identity of ES Dra as an IW And star would require further events.

signal-to-noise, resolution and column density level on the HI morphological
asymmetry ($\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{mod}$) and the effect of noise on the HI global
profile ($\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{flux}$) asymmetry indices. Using mock galaxies
from the EAGLE simulations we find an optimal combination of the observational
constraints that are required for robust measurement of the
$\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{mod}$ value of a galaxy: a column density threshold of
$5\times10^{19}cm^{-2}$ or lower at a minimal signal-to-noise of 3 and a galaxy
resolved with at least 11 beams. We also use mock galaxies to investigate the
effect of noise on the $\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{flux}$ values and conclude that a
global profile with signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5.5 is required to
achieve a robust measurement of asymmetry. We investigate the relation between
$\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{mod}$ and $\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{flux}$ indices and find them
to be uncorrelated which implies that $\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{flux}$ values cannot
be used to predict morphological asymmetries in galaxies.

Title:MaLeFiSenta: Machine Learning for FilamentS Identification and orientation in the ISM,"
Abstract:  Filament identification became a key step to tackling fundamental problems in
various fields of Astronomy. Nevertheless, existing filament identification
algorithms are critically user-dependent and require individual
parametrization. In this study, we aimed at adapting the neural networks
approach to elaborate the best model for filament identification that would not
require fine-tuning for a given astronomical map. First, we created training
samples based on the most commonly used maps of the interstellar medium
obtained by Planck and Herschel space telescopes and the atomic hydrogen
all-sky survey HI4PI. We used the Rolling Hough Transform, a widely used
algorithm for filament identification, to produce training outputs. In the next
step, we trained different neural network models and discovered that a
combination of the Mask R-CNN and U-Net architecture is most appropriate for
filament identification and determination of their orientation angles. We
showed that neural network training might be performed efficiently on a
relatively small training sample of only around 100 maps. Our approach
eliminates the parametrization bias and facilitates filament identification and
angle determination on large data sets.

Title:Relativistic magnetic explosions,"
Abstract:  Many explosive astrophysical events, like magnetars' bursts and flares, are
magnetically driven. We consider dynamics of such magnetic explosions -
relativistic expansion of highly magnetized and highly magnetically
over-pressurized clouds. The corresponding dynamics is qualitatively different
from fluid explosions due to the topological constraint of the conservation of
the magnetic flux. Using analytical, relativistic MHD as well as force-free
calculations, we find that the creation of a relativistically expanding,
causally disconnected flow obeys a threshold condition: it requires
sufficiently high initial over-pressure and sufficiently quick decrease of the
pressure in the external medium (the pre-explosion wind). In the subcritical
case the magnetic cloud just ""puffs-up"" and quietly expands with the pre-flare
wind. We also find a compact analytical solution to the Prendergast's problem -
expansion of force-free plasma into vacuum.

Title:DeepGraviLens: a Multi-Modal Architecture for Classifying Gravitational Lensing Data,"
Abstract:  Gravitational lensing is the relativistic effect generated by massive bodies,
which bend the space-time surrounding them. It is a deeply investigated topic
in astrophysics and allows validating theoretical relativistic results and
studying faint astrophysical objects that would not be visible otherwise. In
recent years Machine Learning methods have been applied to support the analysis
of the gravitational lensing phenomena by detecting lensing effects in data
sets consisting of images associated with brightness variation time series.
However, the state-of-art approaches either consider only images and neglect
time-series data or achieve relatively low accuracy on the most difficult data
sets. This paper introduces DeepGraviLens, a novel multi-modal network that
classifies spatio-temporal data belonging to one non-lensed system type and
three lensed system types. It surpasses the current state of the art accuracy
results by $\approx$ 19% to $\approx$ 43%, depending on the considered data
set. Such an improvement will enable the acceleration of the analysis of lensed
objects in upcoming astrophysical surveys, which will exploit the petabytes of
data collected, e.g., from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

Title:Dark sector domain walls could explain the observed planes of satellites,"
Abstract:  The observed `planes of satellites' around the Milky Way and other nearby
galaxies are notoriously difficult to explain under the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.
Here, we propose an alternative solution: domain walls arising in theories with
symmetry-breaking scalar fields coupled to matter. Because of the matter
coupling, satellite galaxies experience fifth forces as they pass through
domain walls, leading to a subset of satellites with orbits confined to the
domain wall plane. We demonstrate this effect using simple simulations of a toy
model comprising point-like satellites and an infinite domain wall, and explore
the efficacy of various planarity metrics in detecting this effect. We believe
this is the first potential `new physics' explanation for the observed planes
of satellites which does not do away with dark matter.

Title:In-situ calibration system for the measurement of the snow accumulation and the index-of-refraction profile for radio neutrino detectors,"
Abstract:  High-energy neutrinos ($E>10^{17}$eV) are detected cost-efficiently via the
Askaryan effect in ice, where a particle cascade induced by the neutrino
interaction produces coherent radio emission that can be picked up by antennas.
As the near-surface ice properties change rapidly within the upper 40m, a good
understanding of the ice properties is required to reconstruct the neutrino
properties. In particular, continuous monitoring of the snow accumulation
(which changes the depth of the antennas) and the index-of-refraction $n(z)$
profile are crucial for an accurate determination of the neutrino's direction
and energy. We present an in-situ calibration system that extends the radio
detector station with two radio emitters to continuously monitor the firn
properties within the upper 40m by measuring the time differences between
direct and reflected (off the surface) signals (D'n'R). We determine the
optimal positions of two transmitters at all three sites of current and future
radio detectors: Greenland, Moore's Bay, and the South Pole. We find that the
snow accumulation $\Delta h$ can be measured with a resolution of 5mm and the
parameters of an exponential $n(z)$ profile $\Delta n$ and $z_0$ with 0.03% and
0.2% precision respectively, which constitutes an improvement of more than a
factor of 10 as compared to the inference of the $n(z)$ profile from density
measurements. Additionally, as this technique is based on the measurement of
the signal propagation times we are not bound to the conversion of density to
index-of-refraction. We quantify the impact of these ice uncertainties on the
reconstruction of the neutrino vertex, direction, and energy and find that the
calibration device measures the ice properties to sufficient precision to have
negligible influence.

Title:Hydrogen emission from meteors and meteorites: mapping traces of H$_{2}$O molecules and organic compounds in small Solar system bodies,"
Abstract:  The hydrogen emission from meteors is assumed to originate mainly from the
meteoroid composition, making it a potential tracer of H$_{2}$O molecules and
organic compounds. H$\alpha$ line was previously detected in individual
fireballs, but its variation in a larger meteor dataset and dependency on the
dynamical origin and physical properties have not yet been studied. Here we
investigate the relative intensity of H$\alpha$ within 304 meteor spectra
observed by the AMOS network. We demonstrate that H$\alpha$ emission is favored
in faster meteors ($v_i >>$ 30 km s$^{-1}$) which form the high-temperature
spectral component. H$\alpha$ was found to be a characteristic spectral feature
of cometary meteoroids with $\sim$ 92% of all meteoroids with detected
H$\alpha$ originating from Halley-type and long-period orbits. Our results
suggest that hydrogen is being depleted from meteoroids with lower perihelion
distances (q $<$ 0.4 au). No asteroidal meteoroids with detected H emission
were found. However, using spectral data from simulated ablation of different
meteorite types, we show that H emission from asteroidal materials can occur,
and apparently correlates with their water and organic matter content.
Strongest H emission was detected from carbonaceous chondrites (CM and CV) and
achondrites (ureilite and aubrite), while it was lacking in most ordinary
chondrites. The detection of H$\alpha$ in asteroidal meteoroids could be used
to identify meteoroids of carbonaceous or achondritic composition. Overall, our
results suggest that H$\alpha$ emission correlates with the emission of other
volatiles (Na and CN) and presents a suitable tracer of water and organic
matter in meteoroids.

Title:Importance of intracluster scattering and relativistic corrections from tSZ effect with Cosmic Infrared Background,"
Abstract:  The Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect towards clusters of galaxies has become a
standard probe of cosmology. It is caused by the scattering of photons from the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the hot cluster electron gas. In a similar
manner, other photon backgrounds can be scattered when passing through the
cluster medium. This problem has been recently considered for the radio and the
cosmic infrared background. Here we revisit the discussion of the cosmic
infrared background (CIB) including several additional effects that were
omitted before. We discuss the {\it intracluster} scattering of the CIB and the
role of {\it relativistic} temperature corrections to the individual cluster
and all-sky averaged signals. We show that the all-sky CIB distortion
introduced by the scattering of the photon field was underestimated by a factor
of $\simeq 1.5$ due to neglecting the intracluster scattering contribution.
Energy is essentially transferred twice from the thermal electrons to the CIB.
We carefully clarify the origin of various effects in the calculation of the
average CIB and also scattered signals. The single-cluster CIB scattering
signal also exhibits a clear redshift dependence, which can be used in
cosmological analyses, as we describe both analytically and numerically. This
may open a new way for cosmological studies with future CMB experiments.

"Title:The NICER ""Reverberation Machine"": A Systematic Study of Time Lags in Black Hole X-Ray Binaries","
Abstract:  We perform the first systematic search of all NICER archival observations of
black hole (and candidate) low-mass X-ray binaries for signatures of
reverberation. Reverberation lags result from the light travel time difference
between the direct coronal emission and the reflected disk component, and
therefore their properties are a useful probe of the disk-corona geometry. We
detect new signatures of reverberation lags in 8 sources, increasing the total
sample from 3 to 11, and study the evolution of reverberation lag properties as
the sources evolve in outbursts. We find that in all of the 9 sources with more
than 1 reverberation lag detection, the reverberation lags become longer and
dominate at lower Fourier frequencies during the hard-to-soft state transition.
This result shows that the evolution in reverberation lags is a global property
of the state transitions of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries, which is
valuable in constraining models of such state transitions. The reverberation
lag evolution suggests that the corona is the base of a jet which vertically
expands and/or gets ejected during state transition. We also discover that in
the hard state, the reverberation lags get shorter, just as the QPOs move to
higher frequencies, but then in the state transition, while the QPOs continue
to higher frequencies, the lags get longer. We discuss implications for the
coronal geometry and physical models of QPOs in light of this new finding.

Title:Accurate modelling of extragalactic microlensing by compact objects,"
Abstract:  Microlensing of extragalactic sources, in particular the probability of
significant amplifications, is a potentially powerful probe of the abundance of
compact objects outside the halo of the Milky Way. Accurate experimental
constraints require an equally accurate theoretical model for the amplification
statistics produced by such a population. In this article, we argue that the
simplest (strongest-lens) model does not meet this demanding requirement. We
thus propose an elaborate practical modelling scheme for extragalactic
microlensing. We derive from first principles an expression for the
amplification probability that consistently allows for: (i) the coupling
between microlenses; (ii) realistic perturbations from the cosmic large-scale
structure; (iii) extended-source corrections. An important conclusion is that
the external shear applied on the dominant microlens, both by the other lenses
and by the large-scale structure, is practically negligible. Yet, the
predictions of our approach can still differ by a factor of a few with respect
to existing models of the literature. Updated constraints on the abundance of
compact objects accounting for such discrepancies may be required.

Title:A first look at the submillimeter Sun with ALMA,"
Abstract:  We present the first full-disk solar images obtained with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7 (0.86 mm; 347 GHz). In spite of
the low spatial resolution (21""), several interesting results were obtained.
During our observation, the sun was practically devoid of active regions. Quiet
Sun structures on the disk are similar to those in Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) images at 1600 A and 304 A, after the latter are smoothed to the ALMA
resolution, as noted previously for Band 6 (1.26 mm) and Band 3 (3 mm) images;
they are also similar to negative H$\alpha$ images of equivalent resolution.
Polar coronal holes, which are clearly seen in the 304 A band and small
H$\alpha$ filaments, are not detectable at 0.86 mm. We computed the
center-to-limb variation (CLV) of the brightness temperature, $T_b$, in Band 7,
as well as in Bands 6 and 3, which were obtained during the same campaign, and
we combined them to a unique curve of $T_b(\log\mu_{100})$, where $\mu_{100}$
is the cosine of the heliocentric angle reduced to 100 GHz. Assuming that the
absolute calibration of the Band 3 commissioning observations is accurate, we
deduced a brightness temperature at the center of the disk of 6085 K for Band
7, instead of the value of 5500 K, extrapolated from the recommended values for
Bands 3 and 6. More importantly, the $T_b(\log\mu_{100})$ curve flattens at
large values of $\mu_{100}$, and so does the corresponding
$T_e(\log\tau_{100})$ at large $\tau_{100}$. This is probably an indication
that we are approaching the temperature minimum.

Title:The Potential of Detecting Radio-flaring Ultracool Dwarfs at L band in the FAST Drift-scan Survey,"
Abstract:  The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) completed
its commissioning and began the Commensal Radio Astronomy FasT Survey (CRAFTS),
a multi-year survey to cover 60% of the sky, in 2020. We present predictions
for the number of radio-flaring ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) that are likely to be
detected by CRAFTS. Based on the observed flaring UCDs from a number of
unbiased, targeted radio surveys in the literature, we derive a detection rate
of $\ge$3%. Assuming a flat radio spectrum $\nu L _{\nu}\propto \nu^{\beta+1} $
with $\beta$ = -1.0 for UCD flares, we construct a flare luminosity function $d
N/d L \propto L^{-1.96 \pm 0.45}$ (here $L=\nu L_\nu$). CRAFTS is found to be
sensitive enough for flares from UCDs up to $\sim$180 pc. Considering the
Galactic thin disk, we carry out a 3D Monte Carlo simulation of the UCD
population, which is then fed to mock CRAFTS observations. We estimate that
$\sim$170 flaring UCDs would be detected through transient searches in circular
polarization. Though only marginally sensitive to the scale height of UCDs, the
results are very sensitive to the assumed spectral index $\beta$. For $\beta$
from 0 to -2.5, the number of expected detections increases dramatically from
$\sim$20 to $\sim$3460. We also contemplate the strategies for following up
candidates of flaring UCDs, and discuss the implications of survey results for
improving our knowledge of UCD behavior at $L$ band and dynamos.

Title:The Origin of Ultramassive White Dwarfs: Hints from Gaia EDR3,"
Abstract:  Gaia Data Release 2 revealed the presence of a population of ultramassive
white dwarfs on the Q branch that are moving anomalously fast for a local disc
population with the cooling ages determined using white dwarf cooling models,
which has been presented as evidence of an extra cooling delay experienced by
these white dwarfs. In this work, we investigate the kinematics of ultramassive
white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood using the improved Gaia Early Data
Release 3 observations to explore this cooling delay explanation and alternate
possibilities. We performed a kinematic analysis of the transverse motions of
0.95-1.25 $M_\odot$ white dwarfs within 200 pc of the Sun subdivided by mass
and age and compared the result to the expectation based on the observed
kinematics of main sequence stars. The distributions of the transverse velocity
component in the direction of Galactic rotation for different mass and age
ranges reveal a population of photometrically young ($\sim$ 0.5-1.5 Gyr)
ultramassive ($\sim$ 1.15-1.25 $M_\odot$) white dwarfs that lags the local
Galactic rotation and that is too dispersed in this velocity component to be
explained by a cooling delay in white dwarfs originating from the local
Galactic disc. The dispersion ratio of the velocity components in the Galactic
plane for this population is also inconsistent with a local disc origin. We
discuss some possible explanations of this kinematically anomalous population
such as a halo origin or production through dynamical effects of stellar triple
systems.

Title:Updated constraints on WIMP dark matter annihilation by radio observations of M31,"
Abstract:  The present work derived the robust constraints on annihilating WIMP
parameters utilizing new radio observations of M31, as well as new studies of
its dark matter distribution and other properties. The characteristics of
emission due to DM annihilation were computed in the frame of 2D galactic model
employing GALPROP code adapted specifically for M31. This enabled us to refine
various inaccuracies of previous studies on the subject. DM constraints were
obtained for two representative annihilation channels: $\chi\chi \rightarrow
b\overline{b}$ and $\chi\chi \rightarrow \tau^+\tau^-$. A wide variety of radio
data was utilized in the frequency range $\approx$(0.1--10) GHz. As the result
the thermal WIMP lighter than fiducially $\approx$ 70 GeV for $b\overline{b}$
channel and $\approx$ 40 GeV for $\tau^+\tau^-$ was excluded. The corresponding
mass threshold uncertainty ranges were estimated to be 20--210 GeV and 18--89
GeV. The obtained exclusions are competitive to those from Fermi-LAT
observations of dwarfs and AMS-02 measurements of antiprotons. Our constraints
do not exclude the explanation of the gamma-ray outer halo of M31 and the
Galactic center excess by annihilating DM. The thermal WIMP with $m_x \approx
70$ GeV, which explains the outer halo, would make a significant contribution
to the non-thermal radio flux in M31 nucleus, fitting well both the spectrum
and morphology. And, finally, we questioned the possibility claimed in other
studies to robustly constrain heavy thermal WIMP with $m_x > 100$ GeV by radio
data on M31.

Title:High precision modeling of polarized signals: moment expansion method generalized to spin-2 fields,"
Abstract:  The modeling and removal of foregrounds poses a major challenge to searches
for signals from inflation using the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In
particular, the modeling of CMB foregrounds including various spatial averaging
effects introduces multiple complications that will have to be accounted for in
upcoming analyses. In this work, we introduce the generalization of the
intensity moment expansion to the spin-2 field of linear polarization: the
spin-moment expansion. Within this framework, moments become spin-2 objects
that are directly related to the underlying spectral parameter and polarization
angle distribution functions. In obtaining the required expressions for the
polarization modeling, we highlight the similarities and differences with the
intensity moment methods. A spinor rotation in the complex plane with frequency
naturally arises from the first order moment when the signal contains both SED
distortions and polarization mixing. Additional dependencies are introduced at
higher order, and we demonstrate on several illustrative examples how these can
be accounted for. Our new modeling of the polarized SED reveals to be a
powerful tool to model the frequency dependence of the polarization angle. As
such, it can be immediately applied to numerous astrophysical situations.

Abstract:  The fragmentation of two aerospace aluminum alloys is investigated in a

aerodynamic forces in a real atmospheric entry event at three trajectory
points. The emission spectroscopic analysis shows that these materials fail
after distinct alkali metal features are observed in the spectra. The two
alloys feature characteristic emissions of the different alkali metals. The
presence of lithium lines that have previously been exclusively attributed to
battery failure in observation campaigns may be considered as a marker for
aluminum breakup. This is particularly interesting for future entry
observations because it allows a new insight into the structural failure
processes of the demising spacecraft. The lack of emission of alloying elements
points to these spectra being a candidate for the determination of spacecraft
demise. The identification of such features in ground testing will allow a more

Abstract:  51 Eri is well known for hosting a directly-imaged giant planet and for its
membership to the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group. Using two-minute cadence
photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we detect
multi-periodic variability in 51 Eri that is consistent with pulsations of
Gamma Doradus ($\gamma$ Dor) stars. We identify the most significant pulsation
modes (with frequencies between $\sim$0.5-3.9 cycles/day and amplitudes ranging
between $\sim$1-2 mmag) as dipole and quadrupole gravity-modes, as well as
Rossby modes, as previously observed in Kepler $\gamma$ Dor stars. Our results
demonstrate that previously reported variability attributed to stellar rotation
is instead likely due to $\gamma$ Dor pulsations. Using the mean frequency of
the $\ell =1$ gravity-modes, together with empirical trends of the Kepler
$\gamma$ Dor population, we estimate a plausible stellar core rotation period
of 0.9$^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ days for 51 Eri. We find no significant evidence for
transiting companions around 51 Eri in the residual light curve. The detection
of $\gamma$ Dor pulsations presented here, together with follow-up observations
and modeling, may enable the determination of an asteroseismic age for this
benchmark system. Future TESS observations would allow a constraint on the
stellar core rotation rate, which in turn traces the surface rotation rate, and
thus would help clarify whether or not the stellar equatorial plane and orbit
of 51 Eri b are coplanar.

definitions and background on extragalactic magnetism, and present the
scientific motivation and sample selection of the program. Here, we focus on
the general trends in the emissive polarization fraction. Far-infrared
polarimetric observations trace the thermal polarized emission of magnetically
aligned dust grains across the galaxy disks with polarization fractions of
$P=0-15$% in the cold, $T_{\rm d} = [19,48]$ K, and dense, $\log_{10}(N_{\rm
HI+H_{2}}) = [19.96,22.91]$, interstellar medium. The spiral galaxies show a
median $\langle P_{154\mu m} \rangle = 3.3\pm0.9 $% across the disks. We report
the first polarized spectrum of starburst galaxies showing a minimum within
$89-154$ $\mu$m. The falling $53-154$ $\mu$m polarized spectrum may be due to a
decrease in the dust grain alignment efficiency produced by variations in dust
temperatures along the line-of-sight in the galactic outflow. We find that the
starburst galaxies and the star-forming regions within normal galaxies have the
lowest polarization fractions. We find that 50% (7 out of 14) of the galaxies
require a broken power-law in the $P-N_{HI+H_{2}}$ and $P-T_{d}$ relations with
three different trends. Group 1 has a relative increase of anisotropic random
B-fields produced by compression or shear of B-fields in the galactic outflows,
starburst rings, and inner-bar of galaxies; and Groups 2 and 3 have a relative
increase of isotropic random B-fields driven by star-forming regions in the
spiral arms, and/or an increase of dust grain alignment efficiency caused by
shock-driven regions or evolutionary stages of a galaxy.

Title:The gravitational field of X-COP galaxy clusters,"
Abstract:  The mass profiles of massive dark matter halos are highly sensitive to the
nature of dark matter and potential modifications of the theory of gravity on
large scales. The $\Lambda$CDM paradigm makes strong predictions on the shape
of dark matter halos and on the dependence of the shape parameters on halo
mass, such that any deviation from the predicted universal shape would have
important implications for the fundamental properties of dark matter. Here we
use a set of 12 galaxy clusters with available deep X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich
data to constrain the shape of the gravitational field with an unprecedented
level of precision over two decades in radius. On average, we find that the NFW
profile provides an excellent description of the recovered mass profiles, with
deviations of less than 10% over a wide radial range. However, there appears to
be more diversity in the shape of individual profiles than can be captured by
the NFW model. The average NFW concentration and its scatter agree very well
with the prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM framework. For a subset of systems, we
disentangle the gravitational field into the contribution of baryonic
components (gas, brightest cluster galaxy, and satellite galaxies) and that of
dark matter. The stellar content dominates the gravitational field inside
$\sim0.02R_{500}$ but is responsible for only 1-2% of the total gravitational
field inside $R_{200}$. The total baryon fraction reaches the cosmic value at
$R_{200}$ and slightly exceeds it beyond this point, possibly indicating a mild
level of nonthermal pressure support ($10-20\%$) in cluster outskirts. Finally,
the relation between observed and baryonic acceleration exhibits a complex
shape that strongly departs from the radial acceleration relation in spiral
galaxies, which shows that the aforementioned relation does not hold at the
galaxy-cluster scale.

association. Based on kinematic evidence from Gaia, stellar rotation periods

gravitationally-lensed, broad-absorption line quasar ($z=3.91$). After showing
a fairly stable flux ($f_{\rm2-10}\simeq4-5.5\times10^{-13}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$)
from 2000 to 2008, APM 08279+5255 was found in a fainter state in the latest
X-ray exposures ($f_{\rm2-10}\simeq2.7\times10^{-13}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$), which can
likely be ascribed to a lower X-ray activity. Moreover, the 2019 data present a
prominent Fe K$\alpha$ emission line and do not show any significant absorption
line. This fainter state, coupled to the first hard X-ray sampling of APM
08279+5255, allowed us to measure X-ray reflection and the high-energy cutoff
in this source for the first time. From the analysis of previous XMM-Newton and
Chandra observations, X-ray reflection is demonstrated to be a long-lasting
feature of this source, but less prominent prior to 2008, possibly due to a
stronger primary emission. The estimated high-energy cutoff ($E_{\rm
cut}=99_{-35}^{+91}$ keV) sets a new redshift record for the farthest ever
measured and places APM 08279+5255 in the allowed region of the
compactness-temperature diagram of X-ray coronae, in agreement with previous
results on high-$z$ quasars.

Title:A Submillimeter Perspective on the GOODS Fields (SUPER GOODS). V. Deep 450 Micron Imaging,"
Abstract:  We present deep SCUBA-2 450 micron imaging of the two GOODS fields, achieving
a central rms of 1.14 mJy for the GOODS-N and 1.86 mJy for the GOODS-S. For
each field, we give a catalog of >4-sigma detections (79 and 16 sources,
respectively). We construct the 450 micron number counts, finding excellent
agreement with others from the literature. We match the 450 micron sources to
20 cm data (both fields) and ALMA 870 micron data (GOODS-S) to gauge the
accuracy of the 450 micron positions. We use the extensive redshift information
available on the fields to test how well redshift can be estimated from simple
flux ratios (450 micron/850 micron and 20 cm/850 micron), finding tight
correlations. We provide a catalog of candidate high-redshift submillimeter
galaxies. We look for evolution in dust temperature with redshift by fitting
the spectral energy distributions of the sources, but we do not find any
significant redshift evolution after accounting for the far-infrared
luminosity. We do not find evidence for 450 micron selection picking out warmer
sources than 850 micron selection. We find that a 450 micron selected sample
only adds low-redshift (z<1.5) galaxies beyond an 850 micron sample.

Title:Uniform Recalibration of Common Spectrophotometry Standard Stars onto the CALSPEC System using the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph,"
Abstract:  We calibrate spectrophotometric optical spectra of 32 stars commonly used as
standard stars, referenced to 14 stars already on the HST-based CALSPEC flux
system. Observations of CALSPEC and non-CALSPEC stars were obtained with the
SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph over the wavelength range 3300 A to 9400
A as calibration for the Nearby Supernova Factory cosmology experiment. In
total, this analysis used 4289 standard-star spectra taken on photometric
nights. As a modern cosmology analysis, all pre-submission methodological
decisions were made with the flux scale and external comparison results
blinded. The large number of spectra per star allows us to treat the
wavelength-by-wavelength calibration for all nights simultaneously with a
Bayesian hierarchical model, thereby enabling a consistent treatment of the
Type Ia supernova cosmology analysis and the calibration on which it critically
relies. We determine the typical per-observation repeatability (median 14 mmag
for exposures >~ 5 s), the Maunakea atmospheric transmission distribution
(median dispersion of 7 mmag with uncertainty 1 mmag), and the scatter internal
to our CALSPEC reference stars (median of 8 mmag). We also check our standards
against literature filter photometry, finding generally good agreement over the
full 12-magnitude range. Overall, the mean of our system is calibrated to the
mean of CALSPEC at the level of ~ 3 mmag. With our large number of
observations, careful crosschecks, and 14 reference stars, our results are the
best calibration yet achieved with an integral-field spectrograph, and among
the best calibrated surveys.

Title:Constraints on dark matter self-interaction from the internal density profiles of X-COP galaxy clusters,"
Abstract:  TThe fundamental properties of the postulated dark matter (DM) affect the
internal structure of gravitationally-bound structures. In the cold dark matter
paradigm, DM particles interact only via gravity. Their distribution is well
represented by an Einasto profile with shape parameter $\alpha\approx0.18$, in
the smallest dwarf galaxies or the most massive galaxy clusters alike.
Conversely, if dark matter particles self-interact via additional forces, we
expect the mass density profiles of DM halos to flatten in their central
regions, thereby increasing the Einasto shape parameter. We measure the
structural properties of the 12 massive X-COP galaxy clusters from observations
of their hot gaseous atmosphere using the X-ray observatory XMM-Newton, and of
the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect using the Planck all-sky survey. After removing
morphologically disturbed systems, we measure Einasto shape parameters with
mean $\langle\alpha\rangle = 0.19 \pm 0.03$ and intrinsic scatter
$\sigma_{\alpha}=0.06$, in close agreement with the prediction of the cold dark
matter paradigm. We use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of cluster
formation with self-interacting DM (BAHAMAS-SIDM) to determine how the Einasto
shape parameter depends on the self-interaction cross section. We use the
fitted relation to turn our measurements of $\alpha$ into constraints on the
self-interaction cross section, which imply $\sigma/m < 0.19$ cm$^2$/g (95%
confidence level) at collision velocity $v_\mathrm{DM-DM}\sim1,000$ km/s. This
is lower than the interaction cross-section required for dark matter
self-interactions to solve the core-cusp problem in dwarf spheroidal galaxies,
unless the cross section is a strong function of velocity.

"Title:A Radio-selected Population of Dark, Long Gamma-ray Bursts: Comparison to the Long Gamma-ray Burst Population and Implications for Host Dust Distributions","
Abstract:  We present cm-band and mm-band afterglow observations of five long-duration
$\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs; GRB 130131A, 130420B, 130609A, 131229A, 140713A)
with dust-obscured optical afterglow emission, known as ""dark"" GRBs. We detect
the radio afterglow of two of the dark GRBs (GRB 130131A and 140713A), along
with a tentative detection of a third (GRB 131229A) with the Karl G. Jansky
Very Large Array (VLA). Supplemented by three additional VLA-detected dark GRBs
from the literature, we present uniform modeling of their broadband afterglows.
We derive high line-of-sight dust extinctions of $A_{V, \rm GRB} \gtrsim 2.2 -
10.6~{\rm mag}$. Additionally, we model the host galaxies of the six bursts in
our sample, and derive host galaxy dust extinctions of $A_{V, \rm Host} \approx
0.3-4.7~{\rm mag}$. Across all tested $\gamma$-ray (fluence and duration) and
afterglow properties (energy scales, geometries and circumburst densities), we
find dark GRBs to be representative of more typical unobscured long GRBs,
except in fluence, for which observational biases and inconsistent
classification may influence the dark GRB distribution. Additionally, we find
that $A_{V, \rm GRB}$ is not related to a uniform distribution of dust
throughout the host, nor to the extremely local environment of the burst,
indicating that a larger scale patchy dust distribution is the cause of the
high line-of-sight extinction. Since radio observations are invaluable to
revealing heavily dust-obscured GRBs, we make predictions for the detection of
radio emission from host star formation with the next generation VLA.

Title:The defocused observations of bright sources with Athena/X-IFU,"
Abstract:  The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) is the high resolution X-ray
spectrometer of ESA's Athena X-ray observatory. It will deliver X-ray data in
the 0.2-12 keV band with an unprecedented spectral resolution of 2.5 eV up to 7
keV. During the observation of very bright X-ray sources, the X-IFU detectors
will receive high photon rates. The count rate capability of the X-IFU will be
improved by using the defocusing option, which will enable the observations of
extremely bright sources with fluxes up to $\simeq 1$ Crab. In the defocused
mode, the point spread function (PSF) of the telescope will be spread over a
large number of pixels. In this case, each pixel receives a small fraction of
the overall flux. Due to the energy dependence of the PSF, this mode will
generate energy dependent artefacts increasing with count rate if not analysed
properly. To account for the degradation of the energy resolution with pulse
separation in a pixel, a grading scheme (here four grades) will be defined to
affect the proper energy response to each event. This will create selection
effects preventing the use of the nominal Auxiliary Response File (ARF) for all
events. We present a new method for the reconstruction of the spectra obtained
from observations performed with a PSF that varies as a function of energy. We
apply our method to the case of the X-IFU spectra obtained during the defocused
observations. We use the end-to-end SIXTE simulator to model defocused X-IFU
observations. Then we estimate new ARF for each of the grades by calculating
the effective area at the level of each pixel. Our method allows us to
successfully reconstruct the spectra of bright sources when employed in the
defocused mode, without any bias. Finally, we address how various sources of
uncertainty related to our knowledge of the PSF as a function of energy affect
our results.

Title:The Redshift Evolution of Ultraluminous X-Ray Sources out to z~0.5: Comparison with X-Ray Binary Populations and Contribution to the Cosmic X-Ray Background,"
Abstract:  Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are thought to be powerful X-ray binaries
(XRBs) and may contribute significantly to the redshift-dependent X-ray
emission from star forming galaxies. We have assembled a uniform sample of 259
ULXs over the redshift range z=0.002-0.51 to constrain their physical nature
and their contribution to the Cosmic X-Ray Background (CXB). The sample is
constructed by crossmatching galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with
the Chandra Source Catalog and selecting off-nuclear X-ray sources after
applying astrometric corrections. The fraction of contaminants is ~30% and
shows no evolution with redshift. The host galaxy star formation rates (SFRs)
are systematically elevated relative to the parent sample when matched in host
stellar mass. The specific SFRs suggest a slight preference for high-mass XRBs,
and the X-ray luminosity scaling relations with host galaxy stellar mass and
SFR indicate that the highest redshift sources represent relatively luminous
XRB populations that dominate their host galaxy X-ray emission. The fraction of
galaxies hosting at least one ULX of a given luminosity increases with redshift
over the full range of our sample, as expected if ULXs are preferentially found
in galaxies with high SFRs and low metallicities. At z~0.5, the ULX X-ray flux
is consistent with the X-ray emission from star-forming galaxies. Moreover,
ULXs may account for up to ~40% of the integrated flux from XRBs in the normal
galaxy population out to z~0.5, suggesting they may contribute significantly to
the overall ionizing radiation from galaxies.

Title:Measuring Galactic Dark Matter through Unsupervised Machine Learning,"
Abstract:  Measuring the density profile of dark matter in the Solar neighborhood has
important implications for both dark matter theory and experiment. In this
work, we apply autoregressive flows to stars from a realistic simulation of a
Milky Way-type galaxy to learn -- in an unsupervised way -- the stellar phase
space density and its derivatives. With these as inputs, and under the
assumption of dynamic equilibrium, the gravitational acceleration field and
mass density can be calculated directly from the Boltzmann Equation without the
need to assume either cylindrical symmetry or specific functional forms for the
galaxy's mass density. We demonstrate our approach can accurately reconstruct
the mass density and acceleration profiles of the simulated galaxy, even in the
presence of Gaia-like errors in the kinematic measurements.

Title:Deep Learning-Based Super-Resolution and De-Noising for XMM-Newton Images,"
Abstract:  The field of artificial intelligence based image enhancement has been rapidly
evolving over the last few years and is able to produce impressive results on
non-astronomical images. In this work we present the first application of
Machine Learning based super-resolution (SR) and de-noising (DN) to enhance
X-ray images from the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope. Using
XMM-Newton images in band [0.5, 2] keV from the European Photon Imaging Camera
pn detector (EPIC-pn), we develop XMM-SuperRes and XMM-DeNoise deep
learning-based models that can generate enhanced SR and DN images from real
observations. The models are trained on realistic XMM-Newton simulations such
that XMM-SuperRes will output images with two times smaller point-spread
function and with improved noise characteristics. The XMM-DeNoise model is
trained to produce images with 2.5x the input exposure time from 20 to 50 ks.
When tested on real images, DN improves the image quality by 8.2%, as
quantified by the global peak-signal-to-noise ratio. These enhanced images
allow identification of features that are otherwise hard or impossible to
perceive in the original or in filtered/smoothed images with traditional
methods. We demonstrate the feasibility of using our deep learning models to
enhance XMM-Newton X-ray images to increase their scientific value in a way
that could benefit the legacy of the XMM-Newton archive.

Title:Investigating the Constraints on Primordial Features with Future Cosmic Microwave Background and Galaxy Surveys,"
Abstract:  In this article, we do a thorough investigation of the competency of the
forthcoming Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Galaxy surveys in probing the
features in the primordial power spectrum. Primordial features are specific
model-dependent corrections on top of the standard power-law inflationary power
spectrum; the functional form being given by different inflationary scenarios.
Signature of any significant departure from the feature-less power spectrum
will enable us to decipher the intricacies of the inflationary Universe. Here,
we delve into three major yet distinct features, namely, Bump feature, Sharp
feature signal, and Resonance feature signal. To analyse the features, we adopt
a specific template for each feature model. We estimate the possible
constraints on the feature parameters by employing Fisher matrix forecast
analysis for the upcoming CMB missions such as CMB-S4, CORE-M5, LiteBIRD, PICO
conjointly with DESI, and EUCLID galaxy surveys. To this end, we make use of
four distinct observations to forecast on the bounds on the model parameters,
namely, CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Galaxy Clustering and
Gravitational Weak Lensing or Cosmic Shear and their permissible synergy. For
large scale structure (LSS) information, we consider different upper limits of
scale for different redshifts for the purpose of circumventing the propagation
of the errors stemming from the uncertainties on nonlinear scales into the
constraints on the feature parameters. A comparative analysis of all three
features has been done to estimate relative capabilities of these upcoming
observations in shedding light on this crucial aspect of precision cosmology.

Title:Biological Homochirality and the Search for Extraterrestrial Biosignatures,"
Abstract:  Most amino acids and sugars molecules occur in mirror, or chiral, images of
each other, knowns as enantiomers. However, life on Earth is mostly homochiral:
proteins contain almost exclusively L-amino acids, while only D-sugars appear
in RNA and DNA. The mechanism behind this fundamental asymmetry of life remains
unknown, despite much progress in the theoretical and experimental
understanding of homochirality in the past decades. We review three potential
mechanisms for the emergence of biological homochirality on primal Earth and
explore their implications for astrobiology: the first, that biological
homochirality is a stochastic process driven by local environmental
fluctuations; the second, that it is driven by circularly-polarized ultraviolet
radiation in star-forming regions; and the third, that it is driven by parity
violation at the elementary particle level. We argue that each of these
mechanisms leads to different observational consequences for the existence of
enantiomeric excesses in our solar system and in exoplanets, pointing to the
possibility that the search for life elsewhere will help elucidate the origins
of homochirality on Earth.

Title:An Interferometric View of H-MM1. I. Direct Observation of NH3 Depletion,"
Abstract:  Spectral lines of ammonia, NH$_3$, are useful probes of the physical
conditions in dense molecular cloud cores. In addition to advantages in
spectroscopy, ammonia has also been suggested to be resistant to freezing onto
grain surfaces, which should make it a superior tool for studying the interior
parts of cold, dense cores. Here we present high-resolution NH$_3$ observations
with the Very Large Array (VLA) and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) towards a
prestellar core. These observations show an outer region with a fractional
NH$_3$ abundance of X(NH$_3$) = (1.975$\pm$0.005)$\times 10^{-8}$ ($\pm 10\%$
systematic), but it also reveals that after all, the X(NH$_3$) starts to
decrease above a H$_2$ column density of $\approx 2.6 \times 10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$. We derive a density model for the core and find that the break-point
in the fractional abundance occurs at the density n(H$_2$) $\sim 2\times10^5$
cm$^{-3}$, and beyond this point the fractional abundance decreases with
increasing density, following the power law $n^{-1.1}$. This power-law behavior
is well reproduced by chemical models where adsorption onto grains dominates
the removal of ammonia and related species from the gas at high densities. We
suggest that the break-point density changes from core to core depending on the
temperature and the grain properties, but that the depletion power law is
anyway likely to be close to $n^{-1}$ owing to the dominance of accretion in
the central parts of starless cores.

Title:Mass-Metallicity and Star Formation Rate in Galaxies: a complex relation tuned to stellar age,"
Abstract:  In this work we study the stellar mass -- metallicity relation (MZR) of an
extended sample of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe and its possible
dependence with the star formation rate (SFR). A sample of $\sim$195000 Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) star-forming galaxies has been selected up to z=0.22
with the aim of analysing the behaviour of the relation of MZR with respect to
SFR and taking into account the age of their stellar populations. For this
sample we have obtained, for the first time, aperture corrected oxygen and
nitrogen-to-oxygen abundances (O/H and N/O, respectively) and SFR using the
empirical prescriptions from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA)
survey. To perform this study we make use also of the stellar mass of the
galaxies and the parameter Dn(4000) as a proxy of the age of the stellar
population. We derive a robust MZR locus, which is found to be fully consistent
with the ""anchoring"" points of a selected set of well studied nearby galaxies
with a direct derivation of the chemical abundance. A complex relation between
MZR and SFR across the whole range of galaxy mass and metallicity has been
observed, where the slope changes seen in the O/H -- SFR plane present a
pattern which seems to be tuned to the galaxies' stellar age, and therefore,
stellar age has to be taken into account in the stellar mass -- metallicity --
SFR relation. In order to provide an answer to the question of whether or not
the MZR depends on the SFR it is essential to take into account the age of the
stellar populations of galaxies. A strong dependence between the MZR and SFR is
observed mainly for star-forming galaxies with strong SFR values and low
Dn(4000). The youngest galaxies of our SDSS sample show the highest SFR
measured for their stellar mass.

Title:A Search for Annihilating Dark Matter in 47 Tucanae and Omega Centauri,"
Abstract:  A plausible formation scenario for the Galactic globular clusters 47 Tuc and
Omega Cen is that they are tidally stripped remnants of dwarf galaxies, in
which case they are likely to have retained a fraction of their dark matter
cores. In this study, we have used the ultra-wide band receiver on the Parkes
telescope (Murriyang) to place upper limits on the annihilation rate of exotic
Light Dark Matter particles (X) via the XX/$e^+e^-$ channel using measurements
of the recombination rate of positronium (Ps). This is an extension of a
technique previously used to search for Ps in the Galactic Centre. However, by
stacking of spectral data at multiple line frequencies, we have been able to
improve sensitivity. Our measurements have resulted in 3-sigma flux density
(recombination rate) upper limits of 1.7 mJy (1.4x10$^{43}$ s$^{-1}$) and 0.8
mJy (1.1x10$^{43}$ s$^{-1}$) for 47 Tuc and Omega Cen, respectively. Within the
Parkes beam at the cluster distances, which varies from 10 to 23 pc depending
on the frequency of the recombination line, we calculate upper limits to the
dark matter mass and rms dark matter density of <1.2-1.3x10$^5$ fn$^{-0.5}$
(mX/MeV c$^{-2}$) solar masses and <48-54 fn$^{-0.5}$ (mX/MeV c$^{-2}$) solar
masses pc$^{-3}$ for the clusters, where fn=Rn/Rp is the ratio of Ps
recombination transitions to annihilations, estimated to be 0.01. The radio
limits for Omega Cen suggest that, for a fiducial dark/luminous mass ratio of
0.05, any contribution from Light Dark Matter is small unless the cross section
<7.9x10$^{-28}$ (mX/MeV c$^{-2}$)$^2$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$. Owing to the compactness
and proximity of the clusters, archival 511-keV measurements suggest even
tighter limits than permitted by CMB anisotropies, <8.6x10$^{-31}$ (mX/MeV
c$^{-2}$)$^2$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$. Our recombination rate limits substantially
improve on previous radio limits for the Milky Way.

Title:Unveiling polarized emission from interstellar dust of the Large Magellanic Cloud with Planck,"
Abstract:  Polarization of interstellar dust emission is a powerful probe of dust
properties and magnetic field structure. Yet studies of external galaxies are
hampered by foreground dust contribution. The aim of this study is to separate
the polarised signal from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from that of the
Milky Way (MW) in order to construct a wide-field, spatially complete map of
dust polarization using the Planck 353 GHz data. To estimate the foreground
polarization direction, we used velocity gradients in HI spectral line data and
assessed the performance of the output by comparing to starlight extinction
polarization. We estimate the foreground intensity using dust properties
derived previously from the Planck data and we assume the foreground
polarization to be uniform and equal to the average of the MW around the
galaxy. After foreground removal, the geometry of the plane-of-the-sky magnetic
field in the LMC tends to follow the structure of the atomic gas in the LMC.
This is notably the case along the molecular ridges extending south and
south-east of the 30 Doradus star-forming complex, and along more diffuse
southern arm extending towards the Small Magellanic Cloud. There is also an
alignment between the magnetic field and the outer arm in the western part. The
median polarization fraction in the LMC is slightly lower than that observed
for the MW while the anti-correlation between the polarization angle dispersion
function and the polarization fraction is slightly larger. Overall,
polarization fraction distribution is similar to that observed in the MW.

Title:Unveiling the outer dust disc of TW Hya with deep ALMA observations,"
Abstract:  The radial extent of millimetre dust in protoplanetary discs is often far
smaller than that of their gas, mostly due to processes such as dust growth and
radial drift. However, it has been suggested that current millimetre continuum
observations of discs do not trace their full extent due to limited
sensitivity. In this Letter, we present deep (19 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$) moderate
resolution (0.37"") ALMA observations at 1 mm of the nearest protoplanetary
disc, TW Hya. Using the visibility analysis tool `frank', we reveal a
structured millimetre intensity distribution out to 100 au, well beyond
previous estimates of 60-70 au. Our analysis suggests the presence of a new
millimetre continuum gap at 82 au, coincident with similar features seen in
optical/near-infrared scattered light and millimetre molecular line
observations. Examination of the fit residuals confirms the presence of the
previously reported au-scale continuum excess at 52 au (P.A. = 242.5 degrees).
Our results demonstrate the utility of combining deep, moderate resolution
observations with super-resolution analysis techniques to probe the faintest
regions of protoplanetary discs.

Title:Spinning nano-carbon grains: Viable origin for anomalous microwave emission,"
Abstract:  Context. Excess microwave emission, commonly known as anomalous microwave
emission (AME), is now routinely detected in the Milky Way. Although its link
with the rotation of interstellar (carbonaceous) nano-grains seems to be
relatively well established at cloud scales, large-scale observations show a
lack of correlation between the different tracers of nano-carbons and AME,
which has led the community to question the viability of this link. Aims. Using
ancillary data and spinning dust models for nano-carbons and nano-silicates, we
explore the extent to which the AME that come out of the Galactic Plane might
originate with one or another carrier. Methods. In contrast to previous
large-scale studies, our method is not built on comparing the correlations of
the different dust tracers with each other, but rather on comparing the poor
correlations predicted by the models with observed correlations. This is based
on estimates that are as realistic as possible of the gas ionisation state and
grain charge as a function of the local radiation field and gas density.
Results. First, nano-carbon dust can explain all the observations for medium
properties, in agreement with the latest findings about the separation of cold
and warm neutral medium in the diffuse interstellar medium. The dispersion in
the observations can be accounted for with little variations in the dust size
distribution, abundance, or electric dipole moment. Second, regardless of the
properties and abundance of the nano-silicate dust we considered, spinning
nano-silicates are excluded as the sole source of the AME. Third, the best
agreement with the observations is obtained when the emission of spinning
nano-carbons alone is taken into account. However, a marginal participation of
nano-silicates in AME production cannot be excluded as long as their abundance
does not exceed $Y_{\rm Si} \sim 1\%$.

Title:CS-ROMER: A novel compressed sensing framework for Faraday depth reconstruction,"
Abstract:  The reconstruction of Faraday depth structure from incomplete spectral
polarization radio measurements using the RM Synthesis technique is an
under-constrained problem requiring additional regularisation. In this paper we
present cs-romer: a novel object-oriented compressed sensing framework to
reconstruct Faraday depth signals from spectro-polarization radio data. Unlike
previous compressed sensing applications, this framework is designed to work
directly with data that are irregularly sampled in wavelength-squared space and
to incorporate multiple forms of compressed sensing regularisation. We
demonstrate the framework using simulated data for the VLA telescope under a
variety of observing conditions, and we introduce a methodology for identifying
the optimal basis function for reconstruction of these data, using an approach
that can also be applied to datasets from other telescopes and over different
frequency ranges. In this work we show that the delta basis function provides
optimal reconstruction for VLA L-band data and we use this basis with
observations of the low-mass galaxy cluster Abell 1314 in order to reconstruct
the Faraday depth of its constituent cluster galaxies. We use the cs-romer
framework to de-rotate the Galactic Faraday depth contribution directly from
the wavelength-squared data and to handle the spectral behaviour of different
radio sources in a direction-dependent manner. The results of this analysis
show that individual galaxies within Abell 1314 deviate from the behaviour
expected for a Faraday-thin screen such as the intra-cluster medium and instead
suggest that the Faraday rotation exhibited by these galaxies is dominated by
their local environments.

Title:Reducing controls noise in gravitational wave detectors with interferometric local damping of suspended optics,"
Abstract:  Control noise is a limiting factor in the low-frequency performance of the
LIGO gravitational wave detectors. In this paper we model the effects of using
new sensors called HoQIs to control the suspension resonances. We show if we
were to use HoQIs, instead of the standard shadow sensors, we can suppress
resonance peaks up to tenfold more while simultaneously reducing the noise
injected by the damping system. Through a cascade of effects this will reduce
the resonant cross-coupling, allow for improved stability for feed-forward
control, and result in improved sensitivity of the detector in the 10-20 Hz
band. This analysis shows that local sensors such as HoQIs should be used in
current and future detectors to improve low-frequency performance.

Title:Comparison of the star formation of X-ray selected active galactic nuclei in eFEDS with star-forming galaxies,"
Abstract:  We use $\sim 1800$ X-ray Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the eROSITA Final
Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS), that span over two orders of magnitude in
X-ray luminosity, $\rm L_{X,2-10keV} \approx 10^{43-45}\,ergs^{-1}$, and
compare their star-formation rate (SFR) relative to that of non-AGN
star-forming systems, at $\rm 0.5<z<1.5$. For that purpose, we compile a
reference galaxy catalogue with $\sim 17000$ sources. Both samples have the
same photometric coverage, from optical to far-infrared. We construct the
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of all sources and fit them using the
CIGALE code, utilizing the same templates and parametric grid for both samples.
We account for the mass incompleteness and exclude quiescent systems from both
datasets. These allow us to compare the SFR of the two populations in a uniform
manner, minimising systematic effects. Based on our analysis, AGN at low and
moderate L$_X$ ($\rm L_{X,2-10keV} < 10^{44}\,ergs^{-1}$), have SFR that is
lower, or at most, equal to that of star-forming galaxies, in agreement with
previous studies. The large number of luminous X-ray AGN available in the eFEDS
dataset, enable us to expand our investigations at higher L$_X$ to test
previous, tentative results. At $\rm L_{X,2-10keV} > 10^{44.2}\,ergs^{-1}$, the
SFR of AGN appears enhanced, by $\sim 30\%$, compared to that of star-forming
sources, for systems with stellar mass, $\rm 10.5 < log\,[M_*(M_\odot)] <
11.5$, confirming indications found in previous studies. The most massive
sources $\rm log\,[M_*(M_\odot)] > 11.5$, present a flat SFR$_{norm}$-L$_X$
relation up to $\rm L_{X,2-10keV} \sim 10^{44.5}\,ergs^{-1}$, with SFR similar
to that of star-forming galaxies. However, at higher L$_X$ ($\rm L_{X,2-10keV}
\sim 10^{45}\,ergs^{-1}$), we find indications that the SFR of these massive
AGN hosts may be enhanced compared to that of non-AGN systems.

Title:Our Galaxy's youngest disc,"
Abstract:  We investigate the structure of our Galaxy's young stellar disc by fitting
the distribution functions (DFs) of a new family to five-dimensional Gaia data
for a sample of $47\,000$ OB stars. Tests of the fitting procedure show that
the young disc's DF would be strongly constrained by Gaia data if the
distribution of Galactic dust were accurately known. The DF that best fits the
real data accurately predicts the kinematics of stars at their observed
locations, but it predicts the spatial distribution of stars poorly, almost
certainly on account of errors in the best-available dust map. We argue that
dust models could be greatly improved by modifying the dust model until the
spatial distribution of stars predicted by a DF agreed with the data. The
surface density of OB stars is predicted to peak at $R\simeq5.5\mbox{kpc}$,
slightly outside the reported peak in the surface density of molecular gas; we
suggest that the latter radius may have been under-estimated through the use of
poor kinematic distances. The velocity distributions predicted by the best-fit
DF for stars with measured line-of-sight velocities $v_\parallel$ reveal that
the outer disc is disturbed at the level of 10 $\mbox{km}~\mbox{s}^{-1}$ in
agreement with earlier studies, and that the measured values of $v_\parallel$
have significant contributions from the orbital velocities of binaries. Hence
the outer disc is colder than it is sometimes reported to be.

Title:Fundamental effective temperature measurements for eclipsing binary stars -- III. SPIRou near-infrared spectroscopy and CHEOPS photometry of the benchmark G0V star EBLM J0113+31,"
Abstract:  EBLM J0113+31 is moderately bright (V=10.1), metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\approx-0.3$)
G0V star with a much fainter M dwarf companion on a wide, eccentric orbit
(=14.3 d). We have used near-infrared spectroscopy obtained with the SPIRou
spectrograph to measure the semi-amplitude of the M dwarf's spectroscopic
orbit, and high-precision photometry of the eclipse and transit from the CHEOPS
and TESS space missions to measure the geometry of this binary system. From the
combined analysis of these data together with previously published observations
we obtain the following model-independent masses and radii: $M_1 = 1.029 \pm
0.025 M_{\odot}$, $M_2 = 0.197 \pm 0.003 M_{\odot}$, $R_1 = 1.417 \pm 0.014
R_{\odot}$, $R_2 = 0.215 \pm 0.002 R_{\odot}$. Using $R_1$ and the parallax
from Gaia EDR3 we find that this star's angular diameter is $\theta = 0.0745
\pm 0.0007$ mas. The apparent bolometric flux of the G0V star corrected for
both extinction and the contribution from the M dwarf ($<0.2$ per cent) is
${\mathcal F}_{\oplus,0} = (2.62\pm 0.05)\times10^{-9}$ this http URL$^{-2}$.s$^{-1}$.
Hence, this G0V star has an effective temperature $T_{\rm eff,1} = 6124{\rm\,K}
\pm 40{\rm \,K\,(rnd.)} \pm 10 {\rm \,K\,(sys.)}$. EBLM J0113+31 is an ideal
benchmark star that can be used for ""end-to-end"" tests of the stellar
parameters measured by large-scale spectroscopic surveys, or stellar parameters
derived from asteroseismology with PLATO. The techniques developed here can be
applied to many other eclipsing binaries in order to create a network of such
benchmark stars.

Abstract:  We report the results of our search of planet candidates in Open Clusters and
Young Stellar Associations based on the TESS Objects of Interest Catalog. We

unverified planet candidates in a sample of 1229 Open Clusters from the second

of the host stars using the TESS light curves and estimate their ages based on
gyrochronology. Two candidates with periodic variations are likely to be young
planets, but their exact memberships to Young Stellar Associations remain

Title:The effects of Galactic model uncertainties on LISA observations of double neutron stars,"
Abstract:  The upcoming space-based gravitational wave observatory, LISA, will detect
binaries containing pairs of neutron stars. LISA observations of double neutron
stars, particularly in combination with electromagnetic observations, have the
potential to improve our understanding of neutron star physics and binary
evolution. In this work we assess the effect of changing the model of the Milky
Way on predictions of the population of double neutron star binaries that will
be detected and resolved by LISA. We conclude that the spatial and
gravitational-wave frequency distributions of these binaries are insensitive to
the choice of galactic models, compared to the stochastic variation induced by
the small sample size. In particular, the time-consuming computation of the
binaries' Galactic orbits is not necessary. However, the distribution of
eccentricities is strongly affected by the choice of star-formation history.
Binaries with eccentricities e>0.1 that can be measured by LISA observations
are all younger than 100 Myr. We caution that comparisons between different
predictions for LISA observations need to use consistent star formation
histories, and that the Galactic star formation history should be taken into
account in the analysis of the observations themselves.

"Title:Large gauge transformations, local coordinates and cosmological observables","
Abstract:  In recent years new types of coordinate transformations have appeared in
cosmology on top of the standard gauge transformations, such as the dilatations
and special conformal transformations, or the ones leading to (conformal) Fermi
coordinates. Some of these can remove effects that are invariant under the
standard gauge transformations and also affect asymptotic boundary conditions,
thus introducing a non-trivial ambiguity in our cosmological modeling. In this
short note we point out that this ambiguity is irrelevant for the quantities we
use to compare our model with observations -- the cosmological observable
relations -- as they are invariant under all of these transformations.
Importantly, this invariance holds only if one takes into account all the
relativistic contributions to an observable, which is not the case in the
literature in general. We finally also show that the practically-relevant
property of conformal Fermi coordinates (a FLRW metric up to second order in
distance) can be achieved through a globally-defined standard gauge
transformation.

Title:[Mg/Fe] ratios in the solar neighbourhood: stellar yields and chemical evolution scenarios,"
Abstract:  Context. The [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios are a fundamental fossil signature to
trace the chemical evolution of the disc. Despite of the huge observational and
theoretical effort, discrepancies between models and data are still present and
several explanations have been put forward to explain the [$\alpha$/Fe]
bimodality. Aims. In this work, we take advantage of a new AMBRE:HARPS dataset,
which provides new and more precise [Mg/Fe] estimations, as well as reliable
stellar ages for a subsample of stars, to study the evolution of the solar
neighbourhood. Methods. The above data are compared with detailed chemical
evolution models for the Milky Way, exploring the most used prescriptions for
stellar yields and different formation scenarios for the Galactic disc, i.e.
the delayed two-infall and the parallel model, also including prescriptions for
stellar radial migration. Results. We see that most of the stellar yields
struggle to reproduce the observed trend of the data and that semi-empirical
yields are still the best to describe the [Mg/Fe] evolution in the thick and
thin discs. In particular, most of the yields still predict a steeper decrease
of the [Mg/Fe] ratio at high metallicity than what is shown by the data. The
bulk of the data are well reproduced by the parallel and two-infall scenarios,
but both scenarios have problems in explaining the most metal-rich and
metal-poor tails of the low-$\alpha$ data. These tails can be explained in
light of radial migration from inner and outer disc regions, respectively.
Conclusions. Despite of the evidence of stellar migration, it is difficult to
estimate the actual contribution of stars from other parts of the disc to the
solar vicinity. However, the comparison between data and models suggests that
peculiar histories of star formation, such as that of the two-infall model, are
still needed to reproduce the observed distribution of stars.

Title:The dusty heart of Circinus: I. Imaging the circumnuclear dust in N-band,"
Abstract:  Active galactic nuclei play a key role in the evolution of galaxies, but
their inner workings and physical connection to the host are poorly understood
due to a lack of angular resolution. Infrared interferometry makes it possible
to resolve the circumnuclear dust in the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy, Circinus.
Previous observations have revealed complex structures and polar dust emission
but interpretation was limited to simple models. MATISSE makes it possible to
image these structures for the first time. We observed the Circinus Galaxy with
VLTI/MATISSE, producing 150 correlated flux spectra and 100 closure phase
spectra. We reconstructed images in the N-band at ~10 mas resolution. We fit
blackbody functions with dust extinction to several aperture-extracted fluxes
from the images to produce a temperature distribution of central dusty
structures. We find significant substructure in the circumnuclear dust: central
unresolved flux of ~0.5 Jy, a thin disk 1.9 pc in diameter oriented along ~45
deg,and a ~4x1.5 pc polar emission extending orthogonal to the disk. The polar
emission exhibits patchiness, which we attribute to clumpy dust. Flux
enhancements to the east and west of the disk are seen for the first time. We
distinguish the temperature profiles of the disk and of the polar emission: the
disk shows a steep temperature gradient indicative of denser material; the
polar profile is flatter, indicating clumpiness and/or lower dust density. The
unresolved flux is fitted with a high temperature, ~370 K. The polar dust
remains warm (~200 K) out to 1.5 pc from the disk. The recovered morphology and
temperature distribution resembles modeling of accretion disks with
radiation-driven winds at large scales, but we placed new constraints on the
subparsec dust. The subparsec features imaged here place new constraints on the
physical modeling of circumnuclear dust in active galaxies.

Title:A survey of sodium absorption in ten giant exoplanets with high-resolution transmission spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  The alkali metal sodium (Na) is one of the most commonly detected chemical
species in the upper atmospheres of giant exoplanets. In this work we conducted
a homogeneous survey of Na in a diverse sample of ten highly irradiated giant
exoplanets using high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. Our sample includes
nine planets with previous Na detections and one new detection. We confirm
previous detections and assess multiple approaches for deriving Na line
properties from high-resolution transmission spectra. The homogeneously
measured sodium line depths were used to constrain the atmospheric heights
($H_{\text{Na}}$) with respect to the planetary radii ($R_{\text{p}}$). We
assess an empirical trend describing the relative atmospheric height
($H_{\text{Na}}/R_{\text{p}}$) as a function of planetary equilibrium
temperature ($T_{\text{eq}}$) and surface gravity ($g$), in which
$H_{\text{Na}}/R_{\text{p}}$ decreases exponentially with $\xi \propto
gT_{\text{eq}}$, approaching a constant at large $\xi$. We also report the
sodium D2/D1 line ratios across our sample and find that seven targets have
line ratios that are consistent with unity. Finally, we measured net
blueshifted offsets of the sodium absorption lines from their rest frame
wavelengths for all ten planets, corresponding to day-night wind velocities of
a few km s$^{-1}$. This suggests that the broad sample of exoplanets share
common underlying processes that govern atmospheric dynamics. Our study
highlights a promising avenue for using high-resolution transmission
spectroscopy to further our understanding of how atmospheric characteristics
vary over a diverse sample of exoplanets.

Title:Novel cosmological bounds on thermally-produced axion-like particles,"
Abstract:  We constrain the coupling of thermally-produced axion-like particles (here
axions) with photons and gluons, using data from the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) spectra and baryon acoustic oscillations. The axion possesses
an explicit soft breaking mass term and it is produced thermally in the early
Universe from either axion-photon or axion-gluon processes, accounting for the
recent progresses in the field. We derive the most stringent bounds on the
axion-gluon coupling to date on the mass range considered $10^{-4} \lesssim
m_a/{\rm eV} \lesssim 100$, superseding the current bounds from SN1987A. The
bounds on the axion-photon coupling are competitive with the results from the
CAST collaboration for the axion mass $m_a \gtrsim 3\,$eV. We comment on the
forecast reaches that will be available given the sensitivity of future CMB-S4
missions.

Title:On the origin of molecular oxygen on the surface of Ganymede,"
Abstract:  Since its first identification on the surface of Ganymede in 1995, molecular
oxygen (O2) ice has been at the center of a scientific debate as the surface
temperature of the Jovian moon is on average well above the freezing point of
O2. Laboratory evidence suggested that solid O2 may either exist in a cold (<50
K) subsurface layer of the icy surface of Ganymede, or it is in an atmospheric
haze of the moon. Alternatively, O2 is constantly replenished at the surface
through ion irradiation of water-containing ices. A conclusive answer on the
existence of solid O2 on the surface of Ganymede is hampered by the lack of
detailed, extensive observational datasets. We present new ground-based,
high-resolution spectroscopic observations of Ganymede's surface obtained at
the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. These are combined with dedicated laboratory
measurements of ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) photoabsorption spectra of O2 ice,
both pure and mixed with other species of potential interest for the Galilean
satellites. Our study confirms that the two bands identified in the visible
spectra of Ganymede's surface are due to the (1,0) and (0,0) transition bands
of O2 ice. Oxygen-rich ice mixtures including water (H2O) and carbon dioxide
(CO2) can reproduce observational reflectance data of the Ganymede's surface
better than pure O2 ice in the temperature range 20-35 K. Solid H2O and CO2
also provide an environment where O2 ice can be trapped at higher temperatures
than its pure ice desorption under vacuum space conditions. Our experiments at
different temperatures show also that the (1,0)/(0,0) ratio in case of the
CO2:O2=1:2 ice mixture at 35 K has the closest value to observations, while at
30 K the (1,0)/(0,0) ratio seems to be mixture independent with the exception
of the N2:O2=1:2 ice mixture. The present work will support the ESA/JUICE
mission to the Jovian system.

Title:The effect of the deforming dark matter haloes of the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud on the Orphan-Chenab stream,"
Abstract:  It has recently been shown that the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has a
substantial effect on the Milky Way's stellar halo and stellar streams. Here,
we explore how deformations of the Milky Way and LMC's dark matter haloes
affect stellar streams, and whether these effects are observable. In
particular, we focus on the Orphan-Chenab (OC) stream which passes particularly
close to the LMC, and spans a large portion of the Milky Way's halo. We
represent the Milky Way--LMC system using basis function expansions that
capture their evolution in an $N$-body simulation. We present the properties of
this system, such as the evolution of the densities and force fields of each
galaxy. The OC stream is evolved in this time-dependent, deforming potential,
and we investigate the effects of the various moments of the Milky Way and the
LMC. We find that the simulated OC stream is strongly influenced by the
deformations of both the Milky Way and the LMC, and that this effect is much
larger than current observational errors. In particular, the Milky Way dipole
has the biggest impact on the stream, followed by the evolution of the LMC's
monopole, and the LMC's quadrupole. Detecting these effects would confirm a key
prediction of collisionless, cold dark matter, and would be a powerful test of
alternative dark matter and alternative gravity models.

Title:Characterising Atmospheres of Cloudy Temperate Mini-Neptunes with JWST,"
Abstract:  The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) promises a generational shift
in the study of temperate mini-Neptune atmospheres using transit spectroscopy.
High-altitude clouds however threaten to impede their atmospheric
characterisation by muting spectral features. In this study, we systematically
investigate JWST instrument configurations for characterising cloudy
mini-Neptune atmospheres, assessing the importance of instrument choice and
wavelength coverage, focusing on NIRISS and NIRSpec. We consider two temperate
mini-Neptunes orbiting nearby M dwarfs, K2-18 b and TOI-732 c, with equilibrium
temperatures below 400 K, as case studies and assess observations using
different instrument configurations with one transit per instrument. We find
that their JWST transmission spectra with modest observing time and adequate
wavelength coverage can provide precise abundance constraints of key molecules
H2O, CH4, and NH3 even in the presence of clouds at significantly high
altitudes. The best constraints are obtained by combining all three
high-resolution NIRSpec gratings (G140H+G235H+G395H) that together span the
~1-5 $\mu$m range. Single-transit observations with this three-instrument
configuration allow precise abundance constraints for cloud-top pressures as
low as 3 mbar and 0.1 mbar for K2-18 b and TOI-732 c, respectively, assuming a
nominal 10x solar metallicity. The constraints vary with instrument
combinations. We find that NIRSpec G235H+G395H is the optimal two-instrument
configuration, while NIRISS or NIRSpec G235H is optimal for single-instrument
observations. Absent high-altitude clouds, even single-instrument observations
can provide good abundance constraints for these planets. Our findings
underscore the promise of JWST transmission spectroscopy for characterising
temperate mini-Neptunes orbiting nearby M dwarfs.

Title:On the jet-ejecta interaction in 3D GRMHD simulations of binary neutron star merger aftermath,"
Abstract:  Short $\gamma$-ray burst (sGRB) jets form in the aftermath of a neutron star
merger, drill through disk winds and dynamical ejecta, and extend over four to
five orders of magnitude in distance before breaking out of the ejecta. We
present the first 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic sGRB simulations
to span this enormous scale separation. They feature three possible outcomes:
jet+cocoon, cocoon, and neither. Typical sGRB jets break out of the dynamical
ejecta if (i) the bound ejecta's isotropic equivalent mass along the pole at
the time of the BH formation is $ \lesssim10^{-4}~{\rm M_{\odot}} $, setting a
limit on the delay time between the merger and BH formation, otherwise, the
jets perish inside the ejecta and leave the jet-inflated cocoon to power a
low-luminosity sGRB; (ii) the post-merger remnant disk contains strong
large-scale vertical magnetic field, $\gtrsim10^{15}$ G; and (iii) if the jets
are weak ($\lesssim10^{50}$ erg), the ejecta's isotropic equivalent mass along
the pole must be small ($\lesssim10^{-2}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$). Generally, the jet
structure is shaped by the early interaction with disk winds rather than the
dynamical ejecta. As long as our jets break out of the ejecta, they retain a
significant magnetization ($\lesssim1$), suggesting that magnetic reconnection
is a fundamental property of sGRB emission. The angular structure of the
outflow isotropic equivalent energy after breakout consistently features a flat
core followed by a steep power-law distribution (slope $\gtrsim3$), similar to
hydrodynamic jets. In the cocoon-only outcome, the dynamical ejecta broadens
the outflow angular distribution and flattens it (slope $\sim1.5$).

Title:Signatures of mass ratio reversal in gravitational waves from merging binary black holes,"
Abstract:  The spins of merging binary black holes offer insights into their formation
history. Recently it has been argued that in isolated binary evolution of two
massive stars the firstborn black hole is slowly rotating, whilst the
progenitor of the second-born black hole can be tidally spun up if the binary
is tight enough. Naively, one might therefore expect that only the less massive
black hole in merging binaries exhibits non-negligible spin. However, if the
mass ratio of the binary is ""reversed"" (typically during the first mass
transfer episode), it is possible for the tidally spun up second-born to become
the more massive black hole. We study the properties of such mass-ratio
reversed (MRR) binary black hole mergers using a large set of 560 population
synthesis models. We find that the more massive black hole is formed second in
$\gtrsim 70\%$ of binary black holes observable by LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA for
most model variations we consider, with typical total masses $\gtrsim 20$
M$_{\odot}$ and mass ratios $q = m_2 / m_1 \sim 0.7$ (where $m_1 > m_2$). The
formation history of these systems typically involves only stable mass transfer
episodes. The second-born black hole has non-negligible spin ($\chi > 0.05$) in
up to $25\%$ of binary black holes, with among those the more (less) massive
black hole spinning in $0\%$--$80\%$ ($20\%$--$100\%$) of cases, varying
greatly in our models. We discuss our models in the context of several observed
gravitational-wave events and the observed mass ratio - effective spin
correlation.

Abstract:  We discuss five blue stellar systems in the direction of the Virgo cluster,
analogous to the enigmatic object SECCO 1 (AGC 226067). These objects were
identified based on their optical and UV morphology and followed up with HI
observations with the VLA (and GBT), MUSE/VLT optical spectroscopy, and HST
imaging. These new data indicate that one system is a distant group of
galaxies. The remaining four are extremely low mass ($M_\ast \sim 10^5 \;
\mathrm{M_\odot}$), are dominated by young, blue stars, have highly irregular
and clumpy morphologies, are only a few kpc across, yet host an abundance of
metal-rich, $12 + \log (\mathrm{O/H}) > 8.2$, HII regions. These high
metallicities indicate that these stellar systems formed from gas stripped from
much more massive galaxies. Despite the young age of their stellar populations,
only one system is detected in HI, while the remaining three have minimal (if
any) gas reservoirs. Furthermore, two systems are surprisingly isolated and
have no plausible parent galaxy within $\sim$30' ($\sim$140 kpc). Although
tidal stripping cannot be conclusively excluded as the formation mechanism of
these objects, ram pressure stripping more naturally explains their properties,
in particular their isolation, owing to the higher velocities, relative to the
parent system, that can be achieved. Therefore, we posit that most of these
systems formed from ram pressure stripped gas removed from new infalling
cluster members, and survived in the intracluster medium long enough to become
separated from their parent galaxies by hundreds of kiloparsecs, and that they
thus represent a new type of stellar system.

Title:Induced gravitational waves from slow-roll inflation after an enhancing phase,"
Abstract:  The primordial spectrum of fluctuations may present a large peak as a result
of enhancing features during inflation. This may include, but is not limited
to, bumps in the inflaton's potential, phases of ultra-slow-roll or turns in
multi-field space. However, in many models, inflation does not end immediately
after the enhancing feature and it is likely to continue with a second phase of
slow-roll. We show that the resulting induced gravitational waves may probe the
primordial spectrum from the second inflationary phase, even if its amplitude
is too small to directly induce detectable gravitational waves. This is
because, if there are sharp peaks in the primordial spectrum, the total
gravitational wave spectrum is not simply the sum of gravitational waves
induced by a peaked and scale-invariant primordial spectra separately, but
cross terms from interaction between these modes also become important. We also
find that such cross terms always have a characteristic slope. We discuss the
parameter space that may be probed by future gravitational waves detectors in
the presence of these signals.

Title:An exploration of the properties of cluster profiles for the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects,"
Abstract:  With the advent of high-resolution, low-noise CMB measurements, the ability
to extract cosmological information from thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and
kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect will be limited not by statistical
uncertainties but rather by systematic and theoretical uncertainties. The
theoretical uncertainty is driven by the lack of knowledge about the electron
pressure and density. Thus we explore the electron pressure and density
distributions in the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, and we
demonstrate that the cluster properties exhibit a strong dependence on the halo
concentration -- providing some of the first evidence of cluster assembly bias
in the electron pressure and density. Further, our work shows evidence for a
broken power-law mass dependence, with lower pressure in lower mass halos than
previous work and a strong evolution with mass of the radial correlations in
the electron density and pressure. Both of these effects highlight the
differing impact of active galactic nuclei and supernova feedback on the gas in
galaxy groups compared to massive clusters. We verified that we see
qualitatively similar features in the SIMBA hydro-dynamical simulations,
suggesting these effects could be generic features. Finally, we provide a
parametric formula for the electron pressure and density profile as a function
of dark matter halo mass, halo concentration, and redshift. These fitting
formulae can reproduce the distribution of density and pressure of clusters and
will be useful in extracting cosmological information from upcoming CMB
surveys.

Title:Turbulent Heating in a Stratified Medium,"
Abstract:  There is considerable evidence for widespread subsonic turbulence in galaxy
clusters, most notably from {\it Hitomi}. Turbulence is often invoked to offset
radiative losses in cluster cores, both by direct dissipation and by enabling
turbulent heat diffusion. However, in a stratified medium, buoyancy forces
oppose radial motions, making turbulence anisotropic. This can be quantified
via the Froude number ${\rm Fr}$, which decreases inward in clusters as
stratification increases. We exploit analogies with MHD turbulence to show that
wave-turbulence interactions increase cascade times and reduces dissipation
rates $\epsilon \propto {\rm Fr}$. Equivalently, for a given energy
injection/dissipation rate $\epsilon$, turbulent velocities $u$ must be higher
compared to Kolmogorov scalings. High resolution hydrodynamic simulations show
excellent agreement with the $\epsilon \propto {\rm Fr}$ scaling, which sets in
for ${\rm Fr} < 0.1$. We also compare previously predicted scalings for the
turbulent diffusion coefficient $D \propto {\rm Fr}^2$ and find excellent
agreement, for ${\rm Fr} < 1$. However, we find a different normalization,
corresponding to stronger diffusive suppression by more than an order of
magnitude. Our results imply that turbulent diffusion is more heavily
suppressed by stratification, over a much wider radial range, than turbulent
dissipation. Thus, the latter potentially dominates. Furthermore, this shift
implies significantly higher turbulent velocities required to offset cooling,
compared to previous models. These results are potentially relevant to
turbulent metal diffusion (which is likewise suppressed), and to planetary
atmospheres.

"Title:Substructure, supernovae, and time resolved star formation history for Upper Scorpius","
Abstract:  The improved astrometry precision of Gaia-eDR3 allows us to perform a
detailed study of the Upper Scorpius OB association and revisit its kinematic,
spatial, and age substructure. We achieve this by combining the Convergent
Point method with clustering techniques, complementing with age estimations
based on Gaia photometry. We obtain a set of 4028 candidate members for Upper
Scorpius with completeness $\sim$99\% and contamination $\sim$11\%, extending
the current census with Gaia by at least $\sim$9\%. We extract an
astrometrically clean sample of 3114 sources with contamination $\sim$6\%. We
show that Upper Scorpius can be divided into at least 3 main kinematic groups.
We systematically investigate and characterize the Upper Scorpius' internal
structure, revealing that at least $\sim 34\%$ of its stellar populations are
contained in 7 spatial substructures, with well defined boundaries, kinematics
and relative ages, with suggested names: $\pi$ Scorpii (20 $^{\pm2}_{\pm1}$
Myr), $\alpha$ Scorpii (14$^{\pm2}_{\pm1}$ Myr), $\delta$ Scorpii
(9$^{\pm2}_{\pm1}$ Myr), $\beta$ Scorpii (8$^{\pm1}_{\pm1}$ Myr), $\omega$
Scorpii (8$^{\pm1}_{\pm1}$ Myr), $\nu$ Scorpii (7$^{\pm1}_{\pm1}$ Myr), after
their brightest member, and the well known $\rho$ Ophiuchi (4$^{\pm1}_{\pm1}$
Myr). We find a clear correlation in (1) density-age suggesting that these
substructures are expanding at a measurable rate, and (2) tangential
velocity-age, providing constrains on the dynamics of these substructures, and
the position of potential past triggering events. We estimate the time at which
4 potential supernovae events occurred in Upper Scorpius. Based on these
findings, we suggest a star formation scenario for Upper Scorpius with
unprecedented temporal resolution.

Title:Detailed chemical abundances of stars in the outskirts of the Tucana II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy,"
Abstract:  We present chemical abundances and velocities of five stars between 0.3 kpc
to 1.1 kpc from the center of the Tucana II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) from
high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy. We find that every star is
deficient in metals (-3.6 < [Fe/H] < -1.9) and in neutron-capture elements as
is characteristic of UFD stars, unambiguously confirming their association with
Tucana II. Other chemical abundances (e.g., C, iron-peak) largely follow UFD
trends and suggest that faint core-collapse supernovae (SNe) dominated the
early evolution of Tucana II. We see a downturn in [$\alpha$/Fe] at [Fe/H]
$\approx -2.8$, indicating the onset of Type Ia SN enrichment and somewhat
extended chemical evolution. The most metal-rich star has strikingly low
[Sc/Fe] = $-1.29 \pm 0.48$ and [Mn/Fe] = $-1.33 \pm 0.33$, implying significant
enrichment by a sub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia SN. We do not detect a radial
velocity gradient in Tucana II
($\text{d}v_{\text{helio}}/\text{d}\theta_1=-2.6^{+3.0}_{-2.9}$ km s$^{-1}$
kpc$^{-1}$) reflecting a lack of evidence for tidal disruption, and derive a
dynamical mass of $M_{1/2} (r_h) = 1.6^{+1.1}_{-0.7}\times 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$.
We revisit formation scenarios of the extended component of Tucana II in light
of its stellar chemical abundances. We find no evidence that Tucana II had
abnormally energetic SNe, suggesting that if SNe drove in-situ stellar halo
formation then other UFDs should show similar such features. Although not a
unique explanation, the decline in [$\alpha$/Fe] is consistent with an early
galactic merger triggering later star formation. Future observations may
disentangle such formation channels of UFD outskirts.

Title:Heliospheric Compression due to Recent Nearby Supernova Explosions,"
Abstract:  The widespread detection of 60Fe in geological and lunar archives provides
compelling evidence for recent nearby supernova explosions within $\sim 100$ pc
around 3 Myr and 7 Myr ago. The blasts from these explosions had a profound
effect on the heliosphere. We perform new calculations to study the compression
of the heliosphere due to a supernova blast. Assuming a steady but
non-isotropic solar wind, we explore a range of properties appropriate for
supernova distances inspired by recent 60Fe data, and for a 20 pc supernova
proposed to account for mass extinctions at the end-Devonian period. We examine
the locations of the termination shock decelerating the solar wind and the
heliopause that marks the boundary between the solar wind and supernova
material. Pressure balance scaling holds, consistent with studies of other
astrospheres. Solar wind anisotropy does not have an appreciable effect on
shock geometry. We find that supernova explosions at 50 pc (95 pc) lead to
heliopause locations at 16 au (23 au) when the forward shock arrives. Thus, the
outer solar system was directly exposed to the blast, but the inner planets --
including the Earth -- were not. This finding reaffirms that the delivery of
supernova material to the Earth is not from the blast plasma itself, but likely
is from supernova dust grains. After the arrival of the forward shock, the
weakening supernova blast will lead to a gradual rebound of the heliosphere,
taking $\sim100$s of kyr to expand beyond 100 au. Prospects for future work are
discussed.

Title:Evolutionary optimization of cosmological parameters using metropolis acceptance criterion,"
Abstract:  We introduce a novel evolutionary method that takes leverage from the MCMC
method that can be used for constraining the parameters and theoretical models
of Cosmology. Unlike the MCMC technique, which is essentially a non-parallel
algorithm by design, the newly proposed algorithm is able to obtain the full
potential of multi-core machines. With this algorithm, we could obtain the
best-fit parameters of the Lambda CDM cosmological model and identify the
discrepancy in the Hubble parameter $H_0$. In the present work we discuss the
design principle of this novel approach and also the results from the analysis
of Pantheon, OHD and Planck datasets are reported here. The estimation of
parameters shows significant consistency with the previously reported values as
well as a higher computational performance compared to the other similar
exercises.

Title:Fingering convection in the stably-stratified layers of planetary cores,"
Abstract:  Stably-stratified layers may be present at the top of the
electrically-conducting fluid layers of many planets either because the
temperature gradient is locally subadiabatic or because a stable composition
gradient is maintained by the segregation of chemical elements. Here we study
the double-diffusive processes taking place in such a stable layer, considering
the case of Mercury's core where the temperature gradient is stable but the
composition gradient is unstable over a 800km-thick layer. The large difference
in the molecular diffusivities leads to the development of buoyancy-driven
instabilities that drive radial flows known as fingering convection. We model
fingering convection using hydrodynamical simulations in a rotating spherical
shell and varying the rotation rate and the stratification strength. For small
Rayleigh numbers (i.e. weak background temperature and composition gradients),
fingering convection takes the form of columnar flows aligned with the rotation
axis and with an azimuthal size comparable with the layer thickness. For larger
Rayleigh numbers, the flows retain a columnar structure but the azimuthal size
is drastically reduced leading to thin sheet-like structures that are elongated
in the meridional direction. The azimuthal length decreases when the thermal
stratification increases, following closely the scaling law expected from the
linear non-rotating planar theory (Stern, 1960). We find that the radial flows
always remain laminar with local Reynolds number of order 1-10.
Equatorially-symmetric zonal flows form due to latitudinal variations of the
axisymmetric composition. The zonal velocity exceeds the non-axisymmetric
velocities at the largest Rayleigh numbers. We discuss plausible implications
for planetary magnetic fields.

Title:CO Line Emission Surfaces and Vertical Structure in Mid-Inclination Protoplanetary Disks,"
Abstract:  High spatial resolution CO observations of mid-inclination (30-75)
protoplanetary disks offer an opportunity to study the vertical distribution of
CO emission and temperature. The asymmetry of line emission relative to the
disk major axis allows for a direct mapping of the emission height above the
midplane, and for optically-thick, spatially-resolved emission in LTE, the
intensity is a measure of the local gas temperature. Our analysis of ALMA
archival data yields CO emission surfaces, dynamically-constrained stellar host
masses, and disk atmosphere gas temperatures for the disks around: HD 142666,
MY Lup, V4046 Sgr, HD 100546, GW Lup, WaOph 6, DoAr 25, Sz 91, CI Tau, and DM
Tau. These sources span a wide range in stellar masses (0.50-2.10 M$_{\odot}$),
ages (${\sim}$0.3-23 Myr), and CO gas radial emission extents
(${\approx}$200-1000 au). This sample nearly triples the number of disks with
mapped emission surfaces and confirms the wide diversity in line emitting
heights ($z/r\approx0.1$ to ${\gtrsim}0.5$) hinted at in previous studies. We
compute radial and vertical CO gas temperature distributions for each disk. A
few disks show local temperature dips or enhancements, some of which correspond
to dust substructures or the proposed locations of embedded planets. Several
emission surfaces also show vertical substructures, which all align with rings
and gaps in the millimeter dust. Combining our sample with literature sources,
we find that CO line emitting heights weakly decline with stellar mass and gas
temperature, which, despite large scatter, is consistent with simple scaling
relations. We also observe a correlation between CO emission height and disk
size, which is due to the flared structure of disks. Overall, CO emission
surfaces trace ${\approx}2$-$5\times$ gas pressure scale heights (H$_{\rm{g}}$)
and could potentially be calibrated as empirical tracers of H$_{\rm{g}}$.

Title:SNR G292.0+1.8: A Remnant of a Low-Mass Progenitor Stripped-Envelope Supernova,"
Abstract:  We present a study of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8, a
classic example of a core-collapse SNR that contains oxygen-rich ejecta,
circumstellar material, a rapidly moving pulsar, and a pulsar wind nebula
(PWN). We use hydrodynamic simulations of the remnant evolution to show that
the SNR reverse shock is interacting with the PWN and has most likely shocked
the majority of supernova ejecta. In our models, such a scenario requires a
total ejecta mass of $\lesssim 3\: \rm M_{\odot}$ and implies that there is no
significant quantity of cold ejecta in the interior of the reverse shock. In
light of these results, we compare the estimated elemental masses and abundance
ratios in the reverse-shocked ejecta to nucleosynthesis models and find that
they are consistent with a progenitor star with an initial mass of 12-16 $\:
\rm M_{\odot}$. We conclude that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 was likely a
relatively low mass star that experienced significant mass loss through a
binary interaction and would have produced a stripped-envelope supernova
explosion. We also argue that the region known as the ""spur"" in G292.0+1.8
arises as a result of the pulsar's motion through the supernova ejecta and that
its dynamical properties may suggest a line-of-sight component to the pulsar's
velocity, leading to a total space velocity of $\sim 600\: \rm km\:s^{-1}$ and
implying a significant natal kick. Finally, we discuss binary mass loss
scenarios relevant to G292.0+1.8 and their implications for the binary
companion properties and future searches.

Title:First measurement of the characteristic depletion radius of dark matter haloes from weak lensing,"
Abstract:  We use weak lensing observations to make the first measurement of the
characteristic depletion radius, one of the three radii that characterize the
region where matter is being depleted by growing haloes. The lenses are taken
from the halo catalog produced by the extended halo-based group/cluster finder
applied to DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR9, while the sources are extracted
from the DECaLS DR8 imaging data with the Fourier_Quad pipeline. We study halo
masses $12 < \log ( M_{\rm grp} ~[{\rm M_{\odot}}/h] ) \leq 15.3$ within
redshifts $0.2 \leq z \leq 0.3$. The virial and splashback radii are also
measured and used to test the original findings on the depletion region. When
binning haloes by mass, we find consistency between most of our measurements
and predictions from the CosmicGrowth simulation, with exceptions to the lowest
mass bins. The characteristic depletion radius is found to be roughly $2.5$
times the virial radius and $1.7 - 3$ times the splashback radius, in line with
an approximately universal outer density profile, and the average enclosed
density within the characteristic depletion radius is found to be roughly $29$
times the mean matter density of the Universe in our sample. When binning
haloes by both mass and a proxy for halo concentration, we do not detect a
significant variation of the depletion radius with concentration, on which the
simulation prediction is also sensitive to the choice of concentration proxy.
We also confirm that the measured splashback radius varies with concentration
differently from simulation predictions.

Title:Correlated Read Noise Reduction in Infrared Arrays Using Deep Learning,"
Abstract:  We present a new procedure rooted in deep learning to construct science
images from data cubes collected by astronomical instruments using HxRG
detectors in low-flux regimes. It improves on the drawbacks of the conventional
algorithms to construct 2D images from multiple readouts by using the readout
scheme of the detectors to reduce the impact of correlated readout noise. We
train a convolutional recurrent neural network on simulated astrophysical
scenes added to laboratory darks to estimate the flux on each pixel of science
images. This method achieves a reduction of the noise on constructed science
images when compared to standard flux-measurement schemes (correlated double
sampling, up-the-ramp sampling), which results in a reduction of the error on
the spectrum extracted from these science images. Over simulated data cubes
created in a low signal-to-noise ratio regime where this method could have the
largest impact, we find that the error on our constructed science images falls
faster than a $1/\sqrt{N}$ decay, and that the spectrum extracted from the
images has, averaged over a test set of three images, a standard error reduced
by a factor of 1.85 in comparison to the standard up-the-ramp pixel sampling
scheme. The code used in this project is publicly available on GitHub

Abstract:  Recent observations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory

Milky Way Galaxy, thus revolutionizing the field of $\gamma$-ray astrophysics.
In this paper, we study one such detected source, LHAASO J1908+0621, and
explore the origin of multi-TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from this source. A
middle-aged radio supernova remnant SNR G40.5-0.5 and a GeV pulsar PSR
J1907+0602 are co-spatial with LHAASO J1908+0621. Dense molecular clouds are
also found to be associated with SNR G40.5-0.5. We explain the multi-TeV
$\gamma$-ray emission observed from the direction of LHAASO J1908+0621, by the
hadronic interaction between accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR
shock front and cold protons present inside the dense molecular clouds, and the
leptonic emission from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with the pulsar
J1907+0602. Moreover, we explain lower energy $\gamma$-ray emission by
considering the radiative cooling of the electrons that escaped from SNR
G40.5-0.5. Finally, the combined lepto-hadronic scenario was used to explain
the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) of LHAASO J1908+0621.
Although not yet significant, an ICECUBE hotspot of neutrino emission is
spatially associated with LHAASO J1908+0621, indicating a possible hadronic
contribution. In this paper, we show that if a hadronic component is present in
LHAASO J1908+0621, then the second generation ICECUBE observatory will detect
neutrino from this source.

Title:Intra-pulse variability induced by plasmoid formation in pulsar magnetospheres,"
Abstract:  Pulsars show irregularities in their pulsed radio emission that originate
from propagation effects and the intrinsic activity of the source. In this
work, we investigate the role played by magnetic reconnection and the formation
of plasmoids in the pulsar wind current sheet as a possible source of intrinsic
pulse-to-pulse variability in the incoherent, high-energy emission pattern. We
used a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation of an orthogonal pulsar
magnetosphere restricted to the plane perpendicular to the star spin axis. We
evolved the solution for several tens of pulsar periods to gather a
statistically significant sample of synthetic pulse profiles. The formation of
plasmoids leads to strong pulse-to-pulse variability in the form of multiple
short, bright subpulses, which appear only on the leading edge of each main
pulse. These secondary peaks of emission are dominated by the dozen plasmoids
that can grow up to macroscopic scales. They emerge from the high end of the
hierarchical merging process occurring along the wind current layer. The flux
of the subpulses is correlated with their width in phase. Although the
full-scale separation is not realistic, we argue that the simulation correctly
captures the demographics and the properties of the largest plasmoids, and
therefore of the brightest subpulses. The prediction of subpulses at specific
pulse phases provides a new observational test of the magnetic reconnection
scenario as the origin of the pulsed incoherent emission. High-time-resolution
observations of the Crab pulsar in the optical range may be the most promising
source to target for this purpose.

Title:Cosmic rays and random magnetic traps,"
Abstract:  The spatial distribution of cosmic ray (CR) particles in the interstellar
medium (ISM) is of major importance in radio astronomy, where its knowledge is
essential for the interpretation of observations, and in theoretical
astrophysics, where CR contribute to the structure and dynamics of the ISM.
Local inhomogeneities in interstellar magnetic field strength and structure can
affect the local diffusivity and ensemble dynamics of the cosmic ray particles.
Magnetic traps (regions between magnetic mirrors located on the same magnetic
line) can lead to especially strong and persistent features in the CR spatial
distribution. Using test particle simulations, we study the spatial
distribution of an ensemble of CR particles (both protons and electrons) in
various magnetic field configurations, from an idealized axisymmetric trap to
those that emerge in intermittent (dynamo-generated) random magnetic fields. We
demonstrate that both the inhomogeneity in the CR sources and the energy losses
by the CR particles can lead to persistent local inhomogeneities in the CR
distribution and that the protons and electrons have different spatial
distributions. Our results can have profound implications for the
interpretation of the synchrotron emission from astronomical objects, and in
particular its random fluctuations.

Title:Early Solar System instability triggered by dispersal of the gaseous disk,"
Abstract:  The Solar System's orbital structure is thought to have been sculpted by an
episode of dynamical instability among the giant planets. However, the
instability trigger and timing have not been clearly established.
Hydrodynamical modeling has shown that while the Sun's gaseous protoplanetary
disk was present the giant planets migrated into a compact orbital
configuration in a chain of resonances. Here we use dynamical simulations to
show that the giant planets' instability was likely triggered by the dispersal
of the gaseous disk. As the disk evaporated from the inside-out, its inner edge
swept successively across and dynamically perturbed each planet's orbit in
turn. The associated orbital shift caused a dynamical compression of the
exterior part of the system, ultimately triggering instability. The final
orbits of our simulated systems match those of the Solar System for a viable
range of astrophysical parameters. The giant planet instability therefore took
place as the gaseous disk dissipated, constrained by astronomical observations
to be a few to ten million years after the birth of the Solar System.
Terrestrial planet formation would not complete until after such an early giant
planet instability; the growing terrestrial planets may even have been sculpted
by its perturbations, explaining the small mass of Mars relative to Earth.

DO-Optimal performs better than B-DECIGO as a whole on the detection rate, and
has a larger detectable distance for joint sGRB/kilonova searches. Taking the
log-normal population model for BNS mergers and a one-day early-warning time as
an example, we discuss the accuracy in localization and timing, as well as the
redshift distributions for various synergy observations with electromagnetic
facilities and decihertz GW detectors. Based on our analyses, we propose a

Title:Magnetised Winds in Transition Discs I: 2.5D Global Simulations,"
Abstract:  Protoplanetary discs (PPDs) are cold, dense and weakly ionised environments
that witness the planetary formation. Among these discs, transition discs (TDs)
are characterised by a wide cavity in the dust and gas distribution. Despite
this lack of material, many TDs strongly accrete onto their central star,
possibly indicating that a mechanism is driving fast accretion in TDs cavities.
The presence of radially extended 'dead zones' in PPDs recently revived the
interest in magnetised disc winds (MDWs), where accretion is driven by a large
magnetic field. We propose that TDs could be subject to similar winds,
explaining their fast-accreting and long-lived cavities. We present the results
of the first 2.5D global numerical simulations of TDs harbouring MDWs using the
PLUTO code. We impose a cavity in the gas distribution and consider a power law
distribution for the large-scale magnetic field strength. We assume weakly
ionised discs subject to ambipolar diffusion, as expected in this range of
densities and temperatures. Our simulated TDs reach a steady state with an
inner cavity and an outer 'standard' disc. The accretion rates remain
approximately constant through the entire discs, reaching
$10^{-7}~M_\odot/\text{yrs}^{-1}$ for typical surface density values. The MDW
launched from the cavity is more magnetised with a much larger lever arm than
the MDW launched from the outer disc. The material in the cavity is accreted at
sonic velocities, and the cavity itself is rotating at 70% of the Keplerian
velocity due to the efficient magnetic braking imposed by the MDW. Overall, our
cavity matches the dynamical properties of an inner jet emitting disc (JED) and
of magnetically arrested discs (MADs) in black hole physics. Finally, kinematic
diagnostics (wind speeds, orbital and accretion velocities) could disentangle
classical photo-evaporation from MDW models.

Title:On the utility of flux rope models for CME magnetic structure below 30$R_{\odot}$,"
Abstract:  We present a comprehensive analysis of the three-dimensional magnetic flux
rope structure generated during the Lynch et al. (2019) magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulation of a global-scale, 360 degree-wide streamer blowout coronal
mass ejection (CME) eruption. We create both fixed and moving synthetic
spacecraft to generate time series of the MHD variables through different
regions of the flux rope CME. Our moving spacecraft trajectories are derived
from the spatial coordinates of Parker Solar Probe's past encounters 7 and 9
and future encounter 23. Each synthetic time series through the simulation flux
rope ejecta is fit with three different in-situ flux rope models commonly used
to characterize the large-scale, coherent magnetic field rotations observed in
a significant fraction of interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs). We present each of the
in-situ flux rope model fits to the simulation data and discuss the
similarities and differences between the model fits and the MHD simulation's
flux rope spatial orientations, field strengths and rotations, expansion
profiles, and magnetic flux content. We compare in-situ model properties to
those calculated with the MHD data for both classic bipolar and unipolar ICME
flux rope configurations as well as more problematic profiles such as those
with a significant radial component to the flux rope axis orientation or
profiles obtained with large impact parameters. We find general agreement among
the in-situ flux rope fitting results for the classic profiles and much more
variation among results for the problematic profiles. We also examine the
force-free assumption for a subset of the flux rope models and quantify
properties of the Lorentz force within MHD ejecta intervals. We conclude that
the in-situ flux rope models are generally a decent approximation to the field
structure, but all the caveats associated with in-situ flux rope models will
still apply...

Title:Study of water Cherenkov detector design for ground-based gamma-ray experiments,"
Abstract:  In the framework of the development of the SWGO experiment we have performed
a detailed study of the single unit of an extensive air shower observatory
based on an array of water Cherenkov detectors. Indeed, one of the possible
water Cherenkov detector unit configurations for SWGO consists of tanks, and to
reach a high detection efficiency and discrimination capability between
gamma-ray and hadronic air showers, different tank designs are under
investigation. In this study, we considered double-layer tanks with several
sizes, shapes and number of photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs). Muons, electrons,
and gamma-rays with energies typical of secondary particles in extensive air
showers have been simulated entering the tanks with zenith angles from 0 to 60
degrees. The tank response was evaluated considering the number of
photoelectrons produced by the PMTs, the detection efficiency, and the time
resolution of the measurement of the first photon. This analysis allowed to
compare the performance of tanks with different size, configuration of PMTs,
and with circular, hexagonal and square geometry. The method used and the
results will be discussed in this paper.

Title:On the physical size of the Milky Way globular cluster NGC 7089 (M 2),"
Abstract:  We study the outer regions of the Milky Way globular cluster NGC 7089 based
on new Dark Energy Camera (DECam) observations. The resulting background
cleaned stellar density profile reveals the existence of an extended envelope.
We confirm previous results that cluster stars are found out to ~ 1deg from the
cluster's centre, which is nearly three times the value of the most robust
tidal radii estimations. We also used results from direct N-body simulations in
order to compare with the observations. We found a fairly good agreement
between the observed and numerically generated stellar density profiles.
Because of the existence of gaps and substructures along globular cluster tidal
tails, we closely examined the structure of the outer cluster region beyond the
Jacobi radius. We extended the analysis to a sample of 35 globular clusters, 20
of them with observed tidal tails. We found that if the stellar density profile
follows a power law ~ r**(-alpha), the alpha slope correlates with the globular
cluster present mass, in the sense that, the more massive the globular cluster
the smaller the alpha value. This trend is not found in globular clusters
without observed tidal tails. The origin of such a phenomenon could be related,
among other reasons, to the proposed so-called potential escapers or to the
formation of globular clusters within dark matter mini-haloes.

Title:Characterizing the optical nature of the blazar S5 1803+784 during its 2020 flare,"
Abstract:  We report the results from our study of the blazar S5 1803+784 carried out
using the quasi-simultaneous $B$, $V$, $R$, and $I$ observations from May 2020
to July 2021 on 122 nights. Our observing campaign detected the historically
bright optical flare during MJD 59063.5$-$MJD 59120.5. We also found the source
in its brightest ($R_{mag}$= 13.617) and faintest ($R_{mag}$= 15.888) states
till date. On 13 nights, covering both flaring and non-flaring periods, we
searched for the intraday variability using the power-enhanced $F-$test and the
nested ANOVA test. We found significant variability in 2 out of these 13
nights. However, no such variability was detected during the flaring period.
From the correlation analysis, we observed that the emission in all optical
bands were strongly correlated with a time lag of $\sim$ 0 days. To get
insights into its dominant emission mechanisms, we generated the optical
spectral energy distributions of the source on 79 nights and estimated the
spectral indices by fitting the simple power law. Spectral index varied from
1.392 to 1.911 and showed significant variations with time and $R-$band
magnitude. We have detected a mild bluer-when-brighter trend (BWB) during the
whole monitoring period while a much stronger BWB trend during the flare. We
also carried out a periodicity search using four different methods and found no
significant periodicity during our observation duration. Based on the analysis
during the flaring state of the source one can say that the emissions most
likely originate from the jet rather than the accretion disk.

Title:Radio Spectral Energy Distributions for Single Massive Star Winds with Free-Free and Synchrotron Emission,"
Abstract:  The mass-loss rates from single massive stars are high enough to form radio
photospheres at large distances from the stellar surface where the wind is
optically thick to (thermal) free-free opacity. Here we calculate the
far-infrared, millimeter, and radio band spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
that can result from the combination of free-free processes and synchrotron
emission, to explore the conditions for non-thermal SEDs. Simplifying
assumptions are adopted in terms of scaling relations for the magnetic field
strength and the spatial distribution of relativistic electrons. The wind is
assumed to be spherically symmetric, and we consider the effect of Razin
suppression on the synchrotron emission. Under these conditions,
long-wavelength SEDs with synchrotron emission can be either more steep or more
shallow than the canonical asymptotic power-law SED from a non-magnetic wind.
When non-thermal emission is present, the resultant SED shape is generally not
a power-law; however, the variation in slope can change slowly with wavelength.
Consequently, over a limited range of wavelengths, the SED can masquerade as
approximately a power law. While most observed non-thermal long-wavelength
spectra are associated with binarity, synchroton emission can have only a mild
influence on single-star SEDs, requiring finer levels of wavelength sampling
for detection of the effect.

Title:The quasi-periodically oscillating precursor of a long gamma-ray burst from a binary neutron star merger,"
Abstract:  The milestone of GW 170817-GRB 170817A-AT 2017gfo has shown that
gravitational wave (GW) is produced during the merger of neutron star-neutron
star/black hole and that in electromagnetic (EM) wave a gamma-ray burst (GRB)
and a kilonovae (KN) are generated in sequence after the merger.
Observationally, however, EM property during a merger is still unclear. Here we
report a peculiar precursor in a KN-associated long GRB 211211A. The duration
of the precursor is $\sim$ 0.2 s, and the waiting time between the precursor
and the main emission (ME) of the burst is $\sim$ 1 s, which is about the same
as the time interval between GW 170817 and GRB 170817A. Quasi-Periodic
Oscillations (QPO) with frequency $\sim$22 Hz (at $>5\sigma$ significance) are
found throughout the precursor, the first detection of periodic signals from
any {\it bona fide} GRBs. This indicates most likely that a magnetar
participated in the merger, and the precursor might be produced due to a
catastrophic flare accompanying with torsional or crustal oscillations of the
magnetar. The strong seed magnetic field of $\sim 10^{14-15}$ G at the surface
of the magnetar may also account for the prolonged duration of GRB 211211A.
However, it is a challenge to reconcile the rather short lifetime of a magnetar
\cite{kaspi2017magnetars} with the rather long spiraling time of a binary
neutron star system only by gravitational wave radiation before merger.

Title:Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (SMUDGes). III. The Southern SMUDGes Catalog,"
Abstract:  We present a catalog of 5598 ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidates with
effective radius $r_e > 5.3$ arcsec distributed throughout the southern portion
of the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey covering $\sim$ 15000 deg$^2$. The catalog is
most complete for physically large ($r_e > 2.5$ kpc) UDGs lying in the redshift
range $1800 \lesssim cz/{\rm km\ s}^{-1} \lesssim 7000$, where the lower bound
is defined by where incompleteness becomes significant for large objects on the
sky and the upper bound by our minimum angular size selection criterion.
Because physical size is integral to the definition of a UDG, we develop a
method {of distance estimation} using existing redshift surveys. With three
different galaxy samples, two of which contain UDGs with spectroscopic
redshifts, we estimate that the method has a redshift accuracy of $\sim$ 75%
when the method converges, although larger, more representative spectroscopic
UDG samples are needed to fully understand the behavior of the method. We are
able to estimate distances for 1079 of our UDG candidates (19%). Finally, to
illustrate uses of the catalog, we present distance independent and dependent
results. In the latter category we establish that the red sequence of UDGs lies
on the extrapolation of the red sequence relation for bright ellipticals and
that the environment-color relation is at least qualitatively similar to that
of high surface brightness galaxies. Both of these results challenge some of
the models proposed for UDG evolution.

Title:The extreme scarcity of dust-enshrouded red supergiants: consequences for producing stripped stars via winds,"
Abstract:  Quiescent mass-loss during the red supergiant (RSG) phase has been shown to
be far lower than prescriptions typically employed in single-star evolutionary
models. Importantly, RSG winds are too weak to drive the production of
Wolf-Rayets (WRs) and stripped-envelope supernovae (SE-SNe) at initial masses
of roughly 20--40$M_{\odot}$. If single-stars are to make WRs and SE-SNe, this
shifts the burden of mass-loss to rare dust-enshrouded RSGs (DE-RSGs), objects
claimed to represent a short-lived high mass-loss phase. Here, we take a fresh
look at the purported DE-RSGs. By modeling the mid-IR excesses of the full
sample of RSGs in the LMC, we find that only one RSG has both a high mass-loss
rate (\mdot $\ge$ 10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and a high optical
circumstellar dust extinction (7.92 mag). This one RSG is WOH G64, and it is
the only one of the 14 originally proposed DE-RSGs that is actually dust
enshrouded. The rest appear to be either normal RSGs without strong
infrared-excess, or lower-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Only one
additional object in the full catalog of RSGs (not previously identified as a
DE-RSG) shows strong mid-IR excess. We conclude that if DE-RSGs do represent a
pre-SN phase of enhanced \mdot\ in single-stars, it is extremely short-lived,
only capable of removing $\leq$2\msun\ of material. This rules out the
single-star post-RSG pathway for the production of WRs, LBVs, and SE-SN.
Single-star models should not employ \mdot-prescriptions based on these extreme
objects for any significant fraction of the RSG phase.

Title:Results from The COPAINS Pilot Survey: four new brown dwarfs and a high companion detection rate for accelerating stars,"
Abstract:  The last decade of direct imaging (DI) searches for sub-stellar companions
has uncovered a widely diverse sample that challenges the current formation
models, while highlighting the intrinsically low occurrence rate of wide
companions, especially at the lower end of the mass distribution. These results
clearly show how blind surveys, crucial to constrain the underlying planet and
sub-stellar companion population, are not an efficient way to increase the
sample of DI companions. It is therefore becoming clear that efficient target
selection methods are essential to ensure a larger number of detections. We
present the results of the COPAINS Survey conducted with SPHERE/VLT, searching
for sub-stellar companions to stars showing significant proper motion
differences (Delta mu) between different astrometric catalogues. We observed
twenty-five stars and detected ten companions, including four new brown dwarfs:
HIP 21152 B, HIP 29724 B, HD 60584 B and HIP 63734 B. Our results clearly
demonstrates how astrometric signatures, in the past only giving access to
stellar companions, can now thanks to Gaia reveal companions well in the
sub-stellar regime. We also introduce FORECAST (Finley Optimised REtrieval of
Companions of Accelerating STars), a tool which allows to check the agreement
between position and mass of the detected companions with the measured Delta
mu. Given the agreement between the values of the masses of the new sub-stellar
companions from the photometry with the model-independent ones obtained with
FORECAST, the results of COPAINS represent a significant increase of the number
of potential benchmarks for brown dwarf and planet formation and evolution
theories.

Abstract:  We present high-cadence optical and ultraviolet light curves of the normal
Type Ia supernova (SN) 2021aefx, which shows an early bump during the first two
days of observation. This bump may be a signature of interaction between the
exploding white dwarf and a nondegenerate binary companion, or it may be
intrinsic to the white dwarf explosion mechanism. In the case of the former,
the short duration of the bump implies a relatively compact main-sequence
companion star, although this conclusion is viewing-angle dependent. Our
best-fit companion-shocking and double-detonation models both overpredict the
UV luminosity during the bump, and existing nickel-shell models do not match
the strength and timescale of the bump. We also present nebular spectra of SN
2021aefx, which do not show the hydrogen or helium emission expected from a
nondegenerate companion, as well as a radio nondetection that rules out all
symbiotic progenitor systems and most accretion disk winds. Our analysis places
strong but conflicting constraints on the progenitor of SN 2021aefx; no current
model can explain all of our observations.

Title:The THESAN project: ionizing escape fractions of reionization-era galaxies,"
Abstract:  A fundamental requirement for reionizing the Universe is that a sufficient
fraction of the ionizing photons emitted by galaxies successfully escapes into
the intergalactic medium. However, due to the scarcity of high-redshift
observational data, the sources driving reionization remain uncertain. In this
work we calculate the ionizing escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc}$) of
reionization-era galaxies from the state-of-the-art THESAN simulations, which
combine an accurate radiation-hydrodynamic solver AREPO-RT with the well-tested
IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model to self-consistently simulate both
small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale reionization throughout a large
patch of the universe ($L_{\rm box} = 95.5\,\rm cMpc$). This allows the
formation of numerous massive haloes ($M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{10}\,{\rm
M_{\odot}}$), which are often statistically underrepresented in previous
studies but are believed to be important to achieve rapid reionization. We find
that low-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm stars} \lesssim 10^7\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$) are the
main drivers of reionization above $z \gtrsim 7$, while high-mass galaxies
($M_{\rm stars} \gtrsim 10^8\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$) dominate the escaped ionizing
photon budget at lower redshifts. The variation in halo escape fractions
decreases for higher-mass haloes, which can be understood from the more settled
galactic structure, SFR stability, and fraction of sightlines within each halo
significantly contributing to the escaped flux. We show that dust is capable of
reducing the escape fractions of massive galaxies, but the impact on the global
$f_{\rm esc}$ depends on the dust model. Finally, AGN are unimportant for
reionization in THESAN and their escape fractions are lower than stellar ones
due to being located near the centres of galaxy gravitational potential wells.

Title:On-sky reconstruction of Keck Primary Mirror Piston Offsets using a Zernike Wavefront Sensor,"
Abstract:  The next generation of large ground- and space-based optical telescopes will
have segmented primary mirrors. Co-phasing the segments requires a sensitive
wavefront sensor capable of measuring phase discontinuities. The Zernike
wavefront sensor (ZWFS) is a passive wavefront sensor that has been
demonstrated to sense segmented-mirror piston, tip, and tilt with picometer
precision in laboratory settings. We present the first on-sky results of an
adaptive optics fed ZWFS on a segmented aperture telescope, W.M. Keck
Observatory's Keck II. Within the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC)
light path, the ZWFS mask operates in the H-band using an InGaAs detector
(CRED2). We piston segments of the primary mirror by a known amount and measure
the mirror's shape using both the ZWFS and a phase retrieval method on data
acquired with the facility infrared imager, NIRC2. In the latter case, we
employ slightly defocused NIRC2 images and a modified Gerchberg-Saxton phase
retrieval algorithm to estimate the applied wavefront error. We find good
agreement when comparing the phase retrieval and ZWFS reconstructions, with
average measurements of 408 +/- 23 nm and 394 +/- 46 nm, respectively, for
three segments pistoned by 400 nm of optical path difference (OPD). Applying
various OPDs, we are limited to 100 nm OPD of applied piston due to our
observations' insufficient averaging of adaptive optics residuals. We also
present simulations of the ZWFS that help explain the systematic offset
observed in the ZWFS reconstructed data.

Title:Cosmological simulations with rare and frequent dark matter self-interactions,"
Abstract:  Dark matter (DM) with self-interactions is a promising solution for the
small-scale problems of the standard cosmological model. Here we perform the
first cosmological simulation of frequent DM self-interactions, corresponding
to small-angle DM scatterings. The focus of our analysis lies in finding and
understanding differences to the traditionally assumed rare DM (large-angle)
self scatterings. For this purpose, we compute the distribution of DM
densities, the matter power spectrum, the two-point correlation function and
the halo and subhalo mass functions. Furthermore, we investigate the density
profiles of the DM haloes and their shapes. We find that overall large-angle
and small-angle scatterings behave fairly similarly with a few exceptions. In
particular, the number of satellites is considerably suppressed for frequent
compared to rare self-interactions with the same cross-section. Overall we
observe that while differences between the two cases may be difficult to
establish using a single measure, the degeneracy may be broken through a
combination of multiple ones. For instance, the combination of satellite counts
with halo density or shape profiles could allow discriminating between rare and
frequent self-interactions. As a by-product of our analysis, we provide - for
the first time - upper limits on the cross-section for frequent
self-interactions.

Title:Deep Potential: Recovering the gravitational potential from a snapshot of phase space,"
Abstract:  One of the major goals of the field of Milky Way dynamics is to recover the
gravitational potential field. Mapping the potential would allow us to
determine the spatial distribution of matter - both baryonic and dark -
throughout the Galaxy. We present a novel method for determining the
gravitational field from a snapshot of the phase-space positions of stars,
based only on minimal physical assumptions, which makes use of recently
developed tools from the field of deep learning. We first train a normalizing
flow on a sample of observed six-dimensional phase-space coordinates of stars,
obtaining a smooth, differentiable approximation of the distribution function.
Using the Collisionless Boltzmann Equation, we then find the gravitational
potential - represented by a feed-forward neural network - that renders this
distribution function stationary. This method, which we term ""Deep Potential,""
is more flexible than previous parametric methods, which fit restricted classes
of analytic models of the distribution function and potential to the data. We
demonstrate Deep Potential on mock datasets, and demonstrate its robustness
under various non-ideal conditions. Deep Potential is a promising approach to
mapping the density of the Milky Way and other stellar systems, using rich
datasets of stellar positions and kinematics now being provided by Gaia and
ground-based spectroscopic surveys.

Title:The halo finding problem revisited: a deep revision of the ASOHF code,"
Abstract:  Context. New-generation cosmological simulations are providing huge amounts
of data, whose analysis becomes itself a cutting-edge computational problem. In
particular, the identification of gravitationally bound structures, known as
halo finding, is one of the main analyses. A handful of codes developed to
tackle this task have been presented during the last years.
Aims. We present a deep revision of the already existing code ASOHF. The
algorithm has been throughfully redesigned in order to improve its capabilities
to find bound structures and substructures, both using dark matter particles
and stars, its parallel performance, and its abilities to handle simulation
outputs with vast amounts of particles. This upgraded version of ASOHF is
conceived to be a publicly available tool.
Methods. A battery of idealised and realistic tests are presented in order to
assess the performance of the new version of the halo finder.
Results. In the idealised tests, ASOHF produces excellent results, being able
to find virtually all the structures and substructures placed within the
computational domain. When applied to realistic data from simulations, the
performance of our finder is fully consistent with the results from other
commonly used halo finders, with remarkable performance in substructure
detection. Besides, ASOHF turns out to be extremely efficient in terms of
computational cost.
Conclusions. We present a public, deeply revised version of the ASOHF halo
finder. The new version of the code produces remarkable results finding haloes
and subhaloes in cosmological simulations, with an excellent parallel
performance and with a contained computational cost.

Title:Magnetized oscillatory double-diffusive convection,"
Abstract:  We study the properties of oscillatory double-diffusive convection (ODDC) in
the presence of a uniform vertical background magnetic field. ODDC takes place
in stellar regions that are unstable according to the Schwarzschild criterion
and stable according to the Ledoux criterion (sometimes called semiconvective
regions), which are often predicted to reside just outside the core of
intermediate-mass main sequence stars. Previous hydrodynamic studies of ODDC
have shown that the basic instability saturates into a state of weak wave-like
convection, but that a secondary instability can sometimes transform it into a
state of layered convection, where layers then rapidly merge and grow until the
entire region is fully convective. We find that magnetized ODDC has very
similar properties overall, with some important quantitative differences. A
linear stability analysis reveals that the fastest-growing modes are unaffected
by the field, but that other modes are. Numerically, the magnetic field is seen
to influence the saturation of the basic instability, overall reducing the
turbulent fluxes of temperature and composition. This in turn affects layer
formation, usually delaying it, and occasionally suppressing it entirely for
sufficiently strong fields. Further work will be needed, however, to determine
the field strength above which layer formation is actually suppressed in stars.
Potential observational implications are briefly discussed.

Abstract:  The Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic InterStellar

$^{13}$CO (2-1) maps of the Milky Way. It has allowed us to investigate the
molecular interstellar medium in the inner Galaxy at an unprecedented level of
detail and characterise it into molecular clouds. In a previous paper, we have
classified the SEDIGISM clouds into four morphologies. However, how the
properties of the clouds vary for these four morphologies is not well
understood. Here, we use the morphological classification of SEDIGISM clouds to
find connections between the cloud morphologies, their integrated properties,
and their location on scaling relation diagrams. We observe that ring-like
clouds show the most peculiar properties, having, on average, higher masses,
sizes, aspect ratios and velocity dispersions compared to other morphologies.
We speculate that this is related to the physical mechanisms that regulate
their formation and evolution, for example, turbulence from stellar feedback
can often results in the creation of bubble-like structures. We also see a
trend of morphology with virial parameter whereby ring-like, elongated, clumpy
and concentrated clouds have virial parameters in a decreasing order. Our
findings provide a foundation for a better understanding of the molecular cloud
behaviour based on their measurable properties.

electron-positron pair plasma. Generalizing recent treatments by Alves et al.
(2018) and Davelaar et al. (2020), we consider a range of initial structures in
which the force due to toroidal magnetic field is balanced by a combination of
forces due to axial magnetic field and gas pressure. We argue that the particle
energy limit identified by Alves et al. (2018) is due to the finite duration of
the fast magnetic dissipation phase. We find a rather minor role of electric
fields parallel to the local magnetic fields in particle acceleration. In all
investigated cases a kink mode arises in the central core region with a growth
timescale consistent with the predictions of linearized MHD models. In the case
of a gas-pressure-balanced (Z-pinch) profile, we identify a weak local pinch
mode well outside the jet core. We argue that pressure-driven modes are
important for relativistic jets, in regions where sufficient gas pressure is
produced by other dissipation mechanisms.

Title:Morpho-kinematic modeling of the expanding ejecta of the extremely slow nova V1280 Scorpii,"
Abstract:  Morphology of nova ejecta is essential for fully understanding the physical
processes involved in nova eruptions. We studied the 3D morphology of the
expanding ejecta of the extremely slow nova V1280 Sco with a unique light
curve. Synthetic line profile spectra were compared to the observed [O III]
4959, 5007 and [N II] 5755 emission line profiles in order to find the best-fit
morphology, inclination angle, and maximum expansion velocity of the ejected
shell. We derive the best fitting expansion velocity, inclination, and squeeze
as $V_{\rm exp} = 2100^{+100}_{-100}$ \,km\,s$^{-1}$, $i = 80^{+1}_{-3}$ deg,
and $squ = 1.0^{+0.0}_{-0.1}$ using [O III] line profiles, and $V_{\rm exp} =
1600^{+100}_{-100}$ \,km\,s$^{-1}$, $i = 81^{+2}_{-4}$ deg, and $squ =
1.0^{+0.0}_{-0.1}$ using [N II] 5755 line profile. A high inclination angle is
consistent with the observational results showing multiple absorption lines
originating from clumpy gases which are produced in dense and slow equatorially
focused outflows. Based on additional observational features such as optical
flares near the maximum light and dust formation on V1280 Sco, a model of
internal shock interaction between slow ejecta and fast wind proposed for the
$\gamma$-ray emission detected in other novae seems to be applicable to this
extremely slow and peculiar nova. Increasing the sample size of novae whose
morphology is studied will be helpful in addressing long-standing mysteries in
novae such as the dominant energy source to power the optical light at the
maximum, optical flares near the maximum, clumpiness of the ejecta, and dust
formation.

Title:A 62-minute orbital period black widow binary in a wide hierarchical triple,"
Abstract:  Over a dozen millisecond pulsars are ablating low-mass companions in close
binary systems. In the original ""black widow"", the 8-hour orbital period
eclipsing pulsar PSR J1959+2048 (PSR B1957+20), high energy emission
originating from the pulsar is irradiating and may eventually destroy a
low-mass companion. These systems are not only physical laboratories that
reveal the dramatic result of exposing a close companion star to the
relativistic energy output of a pulsar, but are also believed to harbour some
of the most massive neutron stars, allowing for robust tests of the neutron
star equation of state. Here, we report observations of ZTF J1406+1222, a wide
hierarchical triple hosting a 62-minute orbital period black widow candidate
whose optical flux varies by a factor of more than 10. ZTF J1406+1222 pushes
the boundaries of evolutionary models, falling below the 80 minute minimum
orbital period of hydrogen-rich systems. The wide tertiary companion is a rare
low metallicity cool subdwarf star, and the system has a Galactic halo orbit
consistent with passing near the Galactic center, making it a probe of
formation channels, neutron star kick physics, and binary evolution.

Title:A scaled-up planetary system around a supernova progenitor,"
Abstract:  Virtually all known exoplanets reside around stars with $M<2.3~M_\odot$; to
clarify if the dearth of planets around more massive stars is real, we launched
the direct-imaging B-star Exoplanet Abundance STudy (BEAST) survey targeting B
stars ($M>2.4~M_\odot$) in the young (5-20 Myr) Scorpius-Centaurus association
(Sco-Cen). Here we present the case of a massive ($M \sim 9~M_\odot$) BEAST
target, $\mu^2$ Sco. Based on kinematic information, we found that $\mu^2$ Sco
is a member of a small group which we label Eastern Lower Scorpius, refining in
turn the precision on stellar parameters. Around this star we identified a
robustly detected substellar companion ($14.4\pm 0.8 M_J$) at a projected
separation of $290\pm 10$ au, and a probable second object ($18.5\pm 1.5 M_J$)
at $21\pm 1$ au. The planet-to-star mass ratios of these objects are similar to
that of Jupiter to the Sun, and their irradiation is similar to those of
Jupiter and Mercury, respectively. The two companions of $\mu^2$ Sco are
naturally added to the giant planet b Cen b recently discovered by BEAST;
although slightly more massive than the deuterium burning limit, their
properties resemble those of giant planets around less massive stars and they
are better reproduced by a formation under a planet-like, rather than a
star-like scenario. Irrespective of the (needed) confirmation of the inner
companion, $\mu^2$ Sco is the first star that would end its life as a supernova
that hosts such a system. The tentative high frequency of BEAST discoveries
shows that giant planets or small-mass brown dwarfs can form around B stars.
When putting this finding in the context of core accretion and gravitational
instability, we conclude that the current modeling of both mechanisms is not
able to produce this kind of companion. BEAST will pave the way for the first
time to an extension of these models to intermediate and massive stars.

Title:Three-Body Problem in Modified Dynamics,"
Abstract:  General properties of the three-body problem in a model of modified dynamics
are investigated. It is shown that the three-body problem in this model shares
some characters with the similar problem in Newtonian dynamics. Moreover, the
planar restricted three-body problem is solved analytically for this type of
extended gravity and it is proved that under certain conditions, which
generally happen at galactic and extragalactic scales, the orbits around
$L_{4}$ and $L_{5}$ Lagrange points are stable. Furthermore, a code is provided
to compare the behavior of orbits in the restricted three-body problem under
Newtonian and modified dynamics. Orbit integrations based on this code show
contrasting orbital behavior under the two dynamics and specially exhibit in a
qualitative way that the rate of ejections is smaller in the modified dynamics
compared to Newtonian gravity. These results could help us to search for
observational signatures of extended gravities.

Title:The Dark Matter Tidal Stripping History of the Sagittarius Core with N-body simulations,"
Abstract:  The infall of the Sagittarius (Sgr) Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy in the Milky Way
halo is an unique opportunity to understand how the different components of a
dwarf galaxy could be tidally removed. In this work, we reconstruct the Sgr
core morphology and kinematics on the basis of a model that has already
successfully reproduced the Sgr stream. Here we use a very high resolution
model that almost resolves individual stars in the Sgr core. It reproduces most
of the observed morphology and kinematic properties, without specific
fine-tuning. We also show that the dark matter may have been almost entirely
stripped by Milky Way tides after two passages at pericenter. Finally the model
predicts that the Sgr core will be fully disrupted within the next 2 Gyr.

Title:Galactic Kinematics and Observed Flare Rates of a Volume-Complete Sample of Mid-to-Late M-dwarfs: Constraints on the History of the Stellar Radiation Environment of Planets Orbiting Low-mass Stars,"
Abstract:  We present a study of the relationship between galactic kinematics, flare
rates, chromospheric activity, and rotation periods for a volume-complete,
nearly all-sky sample of 219 single stars within 15 parsecs and with masses
between 0.1$-$0.3 M$_{odot}l$ observed during the primary mission of TESS. We
find all stars are consistent with a common value of $\alpha$=1.984 $\pm$ 0.019
for the exponent of the flare frequency distribution. Using our measured
stellar radial velocities and Gaia astrometry, we determine galactic UVW space
motions. We find 64% of stars are members of the Galactic thin disk, 5% belong
to the thick disk, and for the remaining 31%, we cannot confidently assign
membership to either component. If we assume star formation has been constant
in the thin disk for the past 8 Gyr, then based on the fraction that we observe
to be active, we estimate the average age at which these stars transition from
the saturated to the unsaturated flaring regime to be 2.4 $\pm$ 0.3 Gyr. This
is consistent with the ages that we assign from galactic kinematics: We find
that stars with Prot $<$ 10 days have an age of 2.0 $\pm$ 1.2 Gyr, stars with
10 $<$ Prot $\leq$ 90 days have an age of 5.6 $\pm$ 2.7 Gyr, and stars with
Prot $>$ 90 days have an age of 12.9 $\pm$ 3.5 Gyr. We find that the average
age of stars with Prot $<$ 10 days increases with decreasing stellar mass from
0.6 $\pm$ 0.3 Gyr (0.2 - 0.3 M$_{odot}$) to 2.3 $\pm$ 1.3 Gyr (0.1--0.2

Title:On Internal and External Alignment of Dust Grains in Protostellar Environments,"
Abstract:  We study the physical processes inducing the alignment of the grain axis of
maximum inertia moment with the angular momentum (${\bf J}$, i.e., internal
alignment) and of ${\bf J}$ with the magnetic field (i.e., external alignment)
of very large grains (VLGs, of radius $a>10\mu$m) using the grain alignment
framework based on radiative torques (RATs) and mechanical torques (METs). We
derive analytical formulae for critical sizes of grain alignment, assuming that
grains are aligned at both low$-J$ and high$-J$ attractors by RATs (METs). For
protostellar cores, we find that super-Barnett relaxation can induce efficient
internal alignment for VLGs with large iron inclusions aligned at high$-J$
attractors by RATs (METs). In contrast, inelastic relaxation can be efficient
for VLGs made of any composition. For external alignment, we find that VLGs
with iron inclusions aligned at high$-J$ attractors can have magnetic alignment
by RATs ($B-$RAT) or METs ($B-$ MET), enabling dust polarization as a reliable
tracer of magnetic fields in such dense regions. Still, grains at low$-J$
attractors or grains without iron inclusions have alignment along the radiation
direction ($k-$RAT) or gas flow ($v-$MET). For protostellar disks, we find that
super-Barnett relaxation can be efficient for grains with large iron inclusions
in the outer disk thanks to spinup by METs, but inelastic relaxation is
inefficient. VLGs aligned at low-J attractors can have $k-$RAT ($v-$MET)
alignment, but grains aligned at high$-J$ attractors have likely $B-$RAT
($B-$MET) alignment. Grain alignment by METs appears to be more important than
RATs in protostellar disks.

Title:Mixing the solar wind proton and electron scales. Theory and 2D-PIC simulations of firehose instability,"
Abstract:  Firehose-like instabilities (FIs) are cited in multiple astrophysical
applications. Of particular interest are the kinetic manifestations in
weakly-collisional or even collisionless plasmas, where these instabilities are
expected to contribute to the evolution of macroscopic parameters. Relatively
recent studies have initiated a realistic description of FIs, as induced by the
interplay of both species, electrons and protons, dominant in the solar wind
plasma. This work complements the current knowledge with new insights from
linear theory and the first disclosures from 2D PIC simulations, identifying
the fastest growing modes near the instability thresholds and their long-run
consequences on the anisotropic distributions. Thus, unlike previous setups,
these conditions are favorable to those aperiodic branches that propagate
obliquely to the uniform magnetic field, with (maximum) growth rates higher
than periodic, quasi-parallel modes. Theoretical predictions are, in general,
confirmed by the simulations. The aperiodic electron FI (a-EFI) remains
unaffected by the proton anisotropy, and saturates rapidly at low-level
fluctuations. Regarding the firehose instability at proton scales, we see a
stronger competition between the periodic and aperiodic branches. For the
parameters chosen in our analysis, the a-PFI is excited before than the p-PFI,
with the latter reaching a significantly higher fluctuation power. However,
both branches are significantly enhanced by the presence of anisotropic
electrons. The interplay between EFIs and PFIs also produces a more pronounced
proton isotropization.

Title:Remote Sensing of Coronal Forces During a Solar Prominence Eruption,"
Abstract:  We present a new methodology -- the Keplerian Optical Dynamics Analysis
(KODA) -- for analyzing the dynamics of dense, cool material in the solar
corona. The technique involves adaptive spatiotemporal tracking of propagating
intensity gradients and their characterization in terms of time-evolving
Keplerian areas swept out by the position vectors of moving plasma blobs.
Whereas gravity induces purely ballistic motions consistent with Kepler's
second law, non-central forces such as the Lorentz force introduce non-zero
torques resulting in more complex motions. KODA algorithms enable direct
evaluation of the line-of-sight component of the net torque density from the
image-plane projection of the areal acceleration. The method is applied to the
prominence eruption of 2011 June 7, observed by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. Results obtained include
quantitative estimates of the magnetic forces, field intensities, and blob
masses and energies across a vast region impacted by the post-reconnection
redistribution of the prominence material. The magnetic pressure and energy are
strongly dominant during the early, rising phase of the eruption, while the
dynamic pressure and kinetic energy become significant contributors during the
subsequent falling phases. Measured intensive properties of the prominence
blobs are consistent with those of typical active-region prominences; measured
extensive properties are compared with those of the whole pre-eruption
prominence and the post-eruption coronal mass ejection of 2011 June 7, all
derived by other investigators and techniques. We argue that KODA provides
valuable information on characteristics of erupting prominences that are not
readily available via alternative means, thereby shedding new light on their
environment and evolution.

Title:Radial Trapping of Thermal Rossby Waves within the Convection Zones of Low-Mass Stars,"
Abstract:  We explore how thermal Rossby waves propagate within the gravitationally
stratified atmosphere of a low-mass star with an outer convective envelope.
Under the conditions of slow, rotationally constrained dynamics, we derive a
local dispersion relation for atmospheric waves in a fully compressible
stratified fluid. This dispersion relation describes the zonal and radial
propagation of acoustic waves and gravito-inertial waves. Thermal Rossby waves
are just one class of prograde-propagating gravito-inertial wave that manifests
when the buoyancy frequency is small compared to the rotation rate of the star.
From this dispersion relation, we identify the radii at which waves naturally
reflect and demonstrate how thermal Rossby waves can be trapped radially in a
waveguide that permits free propagation in the longitudinal direction. We
explore this trapping further by presenting analytic solutions for thermal
Rossby waves within an isentropically stratified atmosphere that models a zone
of efficient convective heat transport. We find that within such an atmosphere,
waves of short zonal wavelength have a wave cavity that is radially thin and
confined within the outer reaches of the convection zone near the star's
equator. The same behavior is evinced by the thermal Rossby waves that appear
at convective onset in numerical simulations of convection within rotating
spheres. Finally, we suggest that stable thermal Rossby waves could exist in
the lower portion of the Sun's convection zone, despite that region's unstable
stratification. For long wavelengths, the Sun's rotation rate is sufficiently
rapid to stabilize convective motions and the resulting overstable convective
modes are identical to thermal Rossby waves.

Title:Mass loss of massive helium star supernova progenitors shortly before explosion constrained by supernova radio properties,"
Abstract:  Mass loss of massive helium stars is not well understood even though it plays
an essential role in determining their remnant neutron-star or black-hole
masses as well as ejecta mass of Type Ibc supernovae. Radio emission from Type
Ibc supernovae is strongly affected by circumstellar matter properties formed
by mass loss of their massive helium star progenitors. In this study, we
estimate the rise time and peak luminosity distributions of Type Ibc supernovae
in radio based on a few massive helium star mass-loss prescriptions and compare
them with the observed distribution to constrain the uncertain massive helium
star mass-loss rates. We find that massive helium stars in the luminosity range
expected for ordinary Type Ibc supernova progenitors (4.6 ~< log L/Lsun ~< 5.2)
should generally have large mass-loss rates (> ~ 1e-6 Msun/yr) in order to
account for the observed rise time and peak luminosity distribution. Therefore,
mass-loss prescriptions that predict significantly low mass-loss rates for
helium stars in this luminosity range is inconsistent with the supernova radio
observations. It is also possible that massive helium stars shortly before
their explosion generally undergo mass-loss enhancement in a different way from
the standard radiation-driven wind mechanism.

Title:An implementation of Galactic white dwarf binary data analysis for MLDC-3.1,"
Abstract:  The space-borne gravitational wave detectors will observe a large population
of double white dwarf binaries in the Milky Way. However, the search for double
white dwarfs in the gravitational wave data will be time-consuming due to the
large number of templates involved and antenna response calculation. In this
paper, we implement an iterative combinatorial algorithm to search for double
white dwarfs in MLDC-3.1 data. To quickly determine the rough parameters of the
target sources, the following algorithms are adopted in a coarse search
process: (1) using the downsampling method to reduce the number of original
data points; (2) using the undersampling method to speed up the generation of a
single waveform template; (3) using the stochastic template bank method to
quickly construct the waveform template bank while achieving high coverage of
the parameter space; (4) Combining the FFT acceleration algorithm with the
stochastic template bank to reduce the calculation time of a single template. A
fine search process is used to further determine the parameters of the signals
based on the coarse search, for which we adopt the Particle Swarm Optimization.
Finally, we detected $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ double white dwarf signals, validating
the feasibility of our method.

Title:Searching for velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation signals from extragalactic halos,"
Abstract:  We consider gamma-ray signals of dark matter annihilation in extragalactic
halos in the case where dark matter annihilates from a $p$-wave or $d$-wave
state. In these scenarios, signals from extragalactic halos are enhanced
relative to other targets, such as the Galactic Center or dwarf spheroidal
galaxies, because the typical relative speed of the dark matter is larger in
extragalactic halos. We perform a mock data analysis of gamma rays produced by
dark matter annihilation in halos detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
include a model for uncorrelated galactic and extragalactic gamma ray
backgrounds, as well as a simple model for backgrounds due to astrophysical
processes in the extragalactic halos detected by the survey. We find that, for
models which are still allowed by other gamma ray searches, searches of
extragalactic halos with the current Fermi exposure can produce evidence for
dark matter annihilation, though it is difficult to distinguish the $p$-wave
and $d$-wave scenarios. With a factor $10\times$ larger exposure, though,
discrimination of the velocity-dependence is possible.

Title:Selecting and Modelling Remnant AGNs with Limited Spectral Coverage,"
Abstract:  Quantifying the energetics and lifetimes of remnant radio-loud active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) is much more challenging than for active sources due to
the added complexity of accurately determining the time since the central black
hole switched off. Independent spectral modelling of remnant lobes enables the
derivation of the remnant ratio, $R_\mathrm{rem}$, (i.e. `off-time/source
age'), thus reducing this complexity back to that of active sources however,
the requirement of high-frequency ($\gtrsim5\,$GHz) coverage makes the
application of this technique over large-area radio surveys difficult. In this
work we propose a new method, which relies on the observed brightness of
backflow of Fanaroff-Riley type~II lobes, combined with the \emph{Radio AGN in
Semi-Analytic Environments} (RAiSE) code, to measure the duration of the
remnant phase. Sensitive radio observations of the remnant radio galaxy
J2253-34 are obtained to provide a robust comparison of this technique with the
canonical spectral analysis and modelling methods. We find that the remnant
lifetimes modelled by each method are consistent; spectral modelling yields
$R_\mathrm{rem} = 0.23\pm0.02$, compared to $R_\mathrm{rem} = 0.26\pm0.02$ from
our new method. We examine the viability of applying our proposed technique to
low-frequency radio surveys using mock radio source populations, and examine
whether the technique is sensitive to any intrinsic properties of radio AGNs.
Our results show that the technique can be used to robustly classify active and
remnant populations, with the most confident predictions for the remnant ratio,
and thus off-time, in the longest-lived radio sources ($>50~$Myr) and those at
higher redshifts ($z > 0.1$).

Title:Gravitational-wave evolution of newborn magnetars with different deformed structure,"
Abstract:  Weak and continuous gravitational-wave (GW) radiation can be produced by
newborn magnetars with deformed structure and is expected to be detected by the
Einstein telescope in the near future. In this work we assume that the deformed
structure of a nascent magnetar is not caused by a single mechanism but by
multiple time-varying quadrupole moments such as those present in magnetically
induced deformation, starquake-induced ellipticity, and accretion
column-induced deformation. The magnetar loses its angular momentum through
accretion, magnetic dipole radiation, and GW radiation. Within this scenario,
we calculate the evolution of GWs from a newborn magnetar by considering the
above three deformations. We find that the GW evolution depends on the physical
parameters of the magnetar (e.g., period and surface magnetic field), the
adiabatic index, and the fraction of poloidal magnetic energy to the total
magnetic energy. In general the GW radiation from a magnetically induced
deformation is dominant if the surface magnetic field of the magnetar is large,
but the GW radiation from magnetar starquakes is more efficient when there is a
larger adiabatic index if all other magnetar parameters remain the same. We
also find that the GW radiation is not very sensitive to different magnetar
equations of state.

Title:Modeling Gamma-ray burst Afterglow observations with an Off-axis Jet emission,"
Abstract:  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are fascinating extragalactic objects. They represent
a fantastic opportunity to investigate unique properties not exhibited in other
sources. Multi-wavelength afterglow observations from some short- and
long-duration GRBs reveal an atypical long-lasting emission that evolves
differently from the canonical afterglow light curves favoring the off-axis
emission. We present an analytical synchrotron afterglow scenario, and the
hydrodynamical evolution of an off-axis top-hat jet decelerated in a stratified
surrounding environment. The analytical synchrotron afterglow model is shown
during the coasting, deceleration (off- and on-axis emission), and the
post-jet-break decay phases, and the hydrodynamical evolution is computed by
numerical simulations showing the time evolution of the Doppler factor, the
half-opening angle, the bulk Lorentz factor, and the deceleration radius. We
show that numerical simulations are in good agreement with those derived with
our analytical approach. We apply the current synchrotron model and describe
successfully the delayed non-thermal emission observed in a sample of long and
short GRBs with evidence of off-axis emission. Furthermore, we provide
constraints on the possible afterglow emission by requiring the
multi-wavelength upper limits derived for the closest Swift-detected GRBs and
promising gravitational-wave events.

might point to a scale-invariant Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum of primordial
scalar perturbation, i.e. $n_s=1$ for $H_0\sim 73$km/s/Mpc. We show that for
well-known slow-roll models, if inflation ends by a waterfall instability with
respect to another field in the field space while inflaton is still at a deep
slow-roll region, $n_s$ can be lifted to $n_s= 1$. A surprise of our result is
that with pre-recombination early dark energy, chaotic $\phi^2$ inflation,
ruled out by Planck+BICEP/Keck in standard $\Lambda$CDM, can be revived, which
is now well within testable region of upcoming cosmic microwave background
B-mode experiments.

regions associated with moving and stationary type IV bursts are categorised as
close to disk center and far from disk center regions based on their location
on the solar surface (i.e, $\leq 45^{\circ}$ or $\geq 45^{\circ}$,
respectively). The location of the active regions associated with type IV
bursts accompanied with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are also studied. We
found that $\approx 30-40 \%$ of the active regions are located far from disk
center for all the bursts. It is found that most of the active regions
associated with stationary type IV bursts are close to disk center ($\approx
60-70 \%$). The active regions associated with moving type IV bursts are more
evenly distributed across the surface, i.e $\approx 56 \%$ and $\approx 44 \%$,
close to disk center and far from disk center regions, respectively. Most of
the burst having active region close to disk center indicate that these bursts
can be used to obtain physical properties such as electron density and magnetic
fields of the coronal mass ejections responsible for geomagnetic storms.

computation being a factor about 10 times faster if only the CPU was used. We
use this code to examine several disk structures all in the SANE state. We find
that: (i) increasing the magnetic field, while in the SANE state does not
affect the mass accretion rate; (ii) Simultaneous increase of the disk size and
the magnetic field, while keeping the ratio of energies fixed, lead to the
destruction of the jet once the magnetic flux through the horizon decrease
below a certain limit. This demonstrates that the existence of the jet is not a
linear function of the initial magnetic field strength; (iii) the structure of
the jet is a weak function of the adiabatic index of the gas, with relativistic

Abstract:  This Chapter provides a brief tutorial on some aspects of plasma physics that
are fundamental to understanding the dynamics and energetics of the
intracluster medium (ICM). The tutorial is split into two parts: one that
focuses on the thermal plasma component -- its stability, viscosity,
conductivity, and ability to amplify magnetic fields to dynamical strengths via
turbulence and other plasma processes; and one that focuses on the non-thermal
population of charged particles known as cosmic rays -- their acceleration,
re-acceleration, and transport throughout the cluster volume. Observational
context is woven throughout the narrative, from constraints on the strength and
geometry of intracluster magnetic fields and the effective viscosity of the
ICM, to examples of radio halos, radio relics, and cluster shocks that can test
theories of particle acceleration. The promise of future X-ray missions to
probe intracluster turbulence and discover the impact of small-scale plasma
physics, coupled with sensitive, high-resolution radio observations of
synchrotron-emitting plasma that reveal the properties of intracluster magnetic
fields and particle-acceleration mechanisms, are likely to establish galaxy

Digital Sky Survey. We found the observed halo boundary, the splashback radius
$R_{sp}$, which is equal to 4.12 Mpc ($M_r < -20\,.\!\!^{\rm m}3$) and 4.06 Mpc
($M_r < -21\,.\!\!^{\rm m}3$) over the integral distribution of the number of
galaxies as a function of the squared distance from the center. We have studied
how early-type galaxies are distributed in the center and in the outskirts of
the cluster ($R/R_{200}$ < 3, $M_r < -20\,.\!\!^{\rm m}3$) and plotted the red
sequence in the form of (g - r) = $(-0.024\pm0.001)M_r + (0.441\pm0.005$).
Among all the cluster galaxies, the galaxies with the quenched star formation (
$- 12\,yr^{- 1} < \log sSFR < - 10.75\,yr^{- 1}$) make up about one third. We
have found that the fraction of QGs beyond the splashback $R_{sp}$ is the same
as in the field at the same z with coordinates of the center of $16\,.\!\!^{\rm
h}5$, $31^{\circ}$ and a size of $300'$. For galaxies with the stellar masses
$\log M_*/M_{\odot}$ = [10.5;11.0] (this is the main mass range of QGs), after
entering the cluster, there is a decrease in the radii $R_{90,r}$ by about 30\%
when moving towards the center.

Title:The Discovery of a Planetary Companion Interior to Hot Jupiter WASP-132 b,"
Abstract:  Hot Jupiters are generally observed to lack close planetary companions, a
trend that has been interpreted as evidence for high-eccentricity migration. We
present the discovery and validation of WASP-132 c (TOI-822.02), a 1.85 $\pm$
0.10 $R_{\oplus}$ planet on a 1.01 day orbit interior to the hot Jupiter
WASP-132 b. Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and ground-based
follow-up observations, in conjunction with vetting and validation analysis,
enable us to rule out common astrophysical false positives and validate the
observed transit signal produced by WASP-132 c as a planet. Running the
validation tools \texttt{vespa} and \texttt{triceratops} on this signal yield
false positive probabilities of $9.02 \times 10^{-5}$ and 0.0107, respectively.
Analysis of archival CORALIE radial velocity data leads to a 3$\sigma$ upper
limit of 28.23 ms$^{-1}$ on the amplitude of any 1.01-day signal, corresponding
to a 3$\sigma$ upper mass limit of 37.35 $M_{\oplus}$. Dynamical simulations
reveal that the system is stable within the 3$\sigma$ uncertainties on
planetary and orbital parameters for timescales of $\sim$100 Myr. The existence
of a planetary companion near the hot Jupiter WASP-132 b makes the giant
planet's formation and evolution via high-eccentricity migration highly
unlikely. Being one of just a handful of nearby planetary companions to hot
Jupiters, WASP-132 c carries with it significant implications for the formation
of the system and hot Jupiters as a population.

Title:Tossing Black Hole Spin Axes,"
Abstract:  The detection of double black hole (BH+BH) mergers provides a unique
possibility to understand their physical properties and origin. To date, the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network of high-frequency gravitational wave observatories
have announced the detection of more than 85 BH+BH merger events (Abbott et al.
2022a). An important diagnostic feature that can be extracted from the data is
the distribution of effective inspiral spins of the BHs. This distribution is
in clear tension with theoretical expectations from both an isolated binary
star origin, which traditionally predicts close-to aligned BH component spins
(Kalogera 2000; Farr et al. 2017), and formation via dynamical interactions in
dense stellar environments that predicts a symmetric distribution of effective
inspiral spins (Mandel & O'Shaughnessy 2010; Rodriguez et al. 2016b). Here it
is demonstrated that isolated binary evolution can convincingly explain the
observed data if BHs have their spin axis tossed during their formation process
in the core collapse of a massive star, similarly to the process evidently
acting in newborn neutron stars. BH formation without spin-axis tossing,
however, has difficulties reproducing the observed data - even if alignment of
spins prior to the second core collapse is disregarded. Based on simulations
with only a minimum of assumptions, constrains from empirical data can be made
on the spin magnitudes of the first- and second-born BHs, thereby serving to
better understand massive binary star evolution prior to the formation of BHs.

Title:Measuring the distortion of time with relativistic effects in large-scale structure,"
Abstract:  To test the theory of gravity one needs to test, on one hand, how space and
time are distorted by matter and, on the other hand, how matter moves in a
distorted space-time. Current observations provide tight constraints on the
motion of matter, through the so-called redshift-space distortions, but they
only provide a measurement of the sum of the spatial and temporal distortions,
via gravitational lensing. In this Letter, we develop a method to measure the
time distortion on its own. We show that the coming generation of galaxy
surveys, like the Square Kilometer Array, will allow us to measure the
distortion of time with an accuracy of 10-30\%. Such a measurement will be
essential to test deviations from General Relativity in a fully
model-independent way. In particular, it can be used to compare the spatial and
temporal distortions of space-time, that are predicted to be the same in
$\Lambda$CDM but generically differ in modified theories of gravity.

Title:Generation of gravitational waves from freely decaying turbulence,"
Abstract:  We study the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by
freely decaying vortical turbulence in the early Universe. We thoroughly
investigate the time correlation of the velocity field, and hence of the
anisotropic stresses producing the gravitational waves. With hydrodynamical
simulations, we show that the unequal time correlation function (UETC) of the
Fourier components of the velocity field is Gaussian in the time difference, as
predicted by the ""sweeping"" decorrelation model. We introduce a decorrelation
model that can be extended to wavelengths around the integral scale of the
flow. Supplemented with the evolution laws of the kinetic energy and of the
integral scale, this provides a new model UETC of the turbulent velocity field
consistent with the simulations. We discuss the UETC as a positive definite
kernel, and propose to use the Gibbs kernel for the velocity UETC as a natural
way to ensure positive definiteness of the SGWB. The SGWB is given by a
4-dimensional integration of the resulting anisotropic stress UETC with the
gravitational wave Green's function. We perform this integration using a Monte
Carlo algorithm based on importance sampling, and find that the result matches
that of the simulations. Furthermore, the SGWB obtained from the numerical
integration and from the simulations show close agreement with a model in which
the source is constant in time and abruptly turns off after a few eddy turnover
times. Based on this assumption, we provide an approximate analytical form for
the SGWB spectrum and its scaling with the initial kinetic energy and integral
scale. Finally, we use our model and numerical integration algorithm to show
that including an initial growth phase for the turbulent flow heavily
influences the spectral shape of the SGWB. This highlights the importance of a
complete understanding of the turbulence generation mechanism.

Title:J-PLUS: Support Vector Regression to Measure Stellar Parameters,"
Abstract:  Context. Stellar parameters are among the most important characteristics in
studies of stars, which are based on atmosphere models in traditional methods.
However, time cost and brightness limits restrain the efficiency of spectral
observations. The J-PLUS is an observational campaign that aims to obtain
photometry in 12 bands. Owing to its characteristics, J-PLUS data have become a
valuable resource for studies of stars. Machine learning provides powerful
tools to efficiently analyse large data sets, such as the one from J-PLUS, and
enable us to expand the research domain to stellar parameters. Aims. The main
goal of this study is to construct a SVR algorithm to estimate stellar
parameters of the stars in the first data release of the J-PLUS observational
campaign. Methods. The training data for the parameters regressions is featured
with 12-waveband photometry from J-PLUS, and is cross-identified with
spectrum-based catalogs. These catalogs are from the LAMOST, the APOGEE, and
the SEGUE. We then label them with the stellar effective temperature, the
surface gravity and the metallicity. Ten percent of the sample is held out to
apply a blind test. We develop a new method, a multi-model approach in order to
fully take into account the uncertainties of both the magnitudes and stellar
parameters. The method utilizes more than two hundred models to apply the
uncertainty analysis. Results. We present a catalog of 2,493,424 stars with the
Root Mean Square Error of 160K in the effective temperature regression, 0.35 in
the surface gravity regression and 0.25 in the metallicity regression. We also
discuss the advantages of this multi-model approach and compare it to other
machine-learning methods.

Title:Dancing in the dark: detecting a population of distant primordial black holes,"
Abstract:  Primordial black holes (PBHs) are compact objects proposed to have formed in
the early Universe from the collapse of small-scale over-densities. Their
existence may be detected from the observation of gravitational waves (GWs)
emitted by PBH mergers, if the signals can be distinguished from those produced
by the merging of astrophysical black holes. In this work, we forecast the
capability of the Einstein Telescope, a proposed third-generation GW
observatory, to identify and measure the abundance of a subdominant population
of distant PBHs, using the difference in the redshift evolution of the merger
rate of the two populations as our discriminant. We carefully model the merger
rates and generate realistic mock catalogues of the luminosity distances and
errors that would be obtained from GW signals observed by the Einstein
Telescope. We use two independent statistical methods to analyse the mock data,
finding that, with our more powerful, likelihood-based method, PBH abundances
as small as $f_\mathrm{PBH} \approx 7 \times 10^{-6}$ ($f_\mathrm{PBH} \approx
2\times10^{-6}$) would be distinguishable from $f_\mathrm{PBH} = 0$ at the
level of $3\sigma$ with a one year (ten year) observing run of the Einstein
Telescope. Our mock data generation code, darksirens, is fast, easily
extendable and publicly available on GitLab.

Title:High-energy reconstruction for single and double cascades using the KM3NeT detector,"
Abstract:  The discovery of a high-energy cosmic neutrino flux has paved the way for the
field of neutrino astronomy. For a large part of the flux, the sources remain
unidentified. The KM3NeT detector, which is under construction in the
Mediterranean sea, is designed to determine their origin. KM3NeT will
instrument a cubic kilometre of seawater with photomultiplier tubes that detect
Cherenkov radiation from neutrino interaction products with nanosecond
precision. For single cascade event signatures, KM3NeT already showed that it
can reach degree-level resolutions, greatly increasing the use of these
neutrinos for astronomy. In this contribution, we further refine the cascade
reconstruction by making a more detailed model of the neutrinos events and
including additional information on the hit times. The arrival time of light
can be used to improve the identification of double cascade signatures from tau
neutrinos, and the angular resolution of both single and double cascade
signatures. Sub-degree resolution is achieved in both cases.

Title:Absorption spectra from galactic wind models: a framework to link PLUTO simulations to TRIDENT,"
Abstract:  Galactic winds probe how feedback regulates the mass and metallicity of
galaxies. Galactic winds have cold gas, which is mainly observable with
absorption and emission lines. Theoretically studying how absorption lines are
produced requires numerical simulations and realistic starburst UV backgrounds.
We use outputs from a suite of 3D PLUTO simulations of wind-cloud interactions
to first estimate column densities and temperatures. Then, to create synthetic
spectra, we developed a python interface to link our PLUTO simulations to
TRIDENT via the YT-package infrastructure. First we produce UV backgrounds
accounting for the star formation rate of starbursts. For this purpose, we use
fluxes generated by STARBURST99, which are then processed through CLOUDY to
create customised ion tables. Such tables are subsequently read into TRIDENT to
generate absorption spectra. We explain how the various packages and tools
communicate with each other to create ion spectra consistent with spectral
energy distributions of starburst systems.

Title:Direct Imaging Discovery and Dynamical Mass of a Substellar Companion Orbiting an Accelerating Hyades Sun-like Star with SCExAO/CHARIS,"
Abstract:  We present the direct-imaging discovery of a substellar companion in orbit
around a Sun-like star member of the Hyades open cluster. So far, no other
substellar companions have been unambiguously confirmed via direct imaging
around main-sequence stars in Hyades. The star HIP 21152 is an accelerating
star as identified by the astrometry from the Gaia and Hipparcos satellites. We
have detected the companion, HIP 21152 B, in multi-epoch using the
high-contrast imaging from SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2. We have also obtained
the stellar radial-velocity data from the Okayama 188cm telescope. The CHARIS
spectroscopy reveals that HIP 21152 B's spectrum is consistent with the L/T
transition, best fit by an early T dwarf. Our orbit modeling determines the
semi-major axis and the dynamical mass of HIP 21152 B to be
17.5$^{+7.2}_{-3.8}$ au and 27.8$^{+8.4}_{-5.4}$ $M_{\rm{Jup}}$, respectively.
The mass ratio of HIP 21152 B relative to its host is $\approx$2\%, near the
planet/brown dwarf boundary suggested from recent surveys. Mass estimates
inferred from luminosity evolution models are slightly higher (33--42
$M_{\rm{Jup}}$). With a dynamical mass and a well-constrained age due to the
system's Hyades membership, HIP 21152 B will become a critical benchmark in
understanding the formation, evolution, and atmosphere of a substellar object
as a function of mass and age. Our discovery is yet another key
proof-of-concept for using precision astrometry to select direct imaging
targets.

Title:The VVV Open Cluster Project II. Near-infrared sequences of 37 open clusters on eight-dimensional parameter space,"
Abstract:  Open clusters are key coeval structures that help us understand star
formation, stellar evolution and trace the physical properties of our Galaxy.
In the past years, the isolation of open clusters from the field has been
heavily alleviated by the access to accurate large-scale stellar parallaxes and
proper motions along a determined line of sight. Still, there are limitations
regarding their completeness since large-scale studies rely on optical
wavelengths. Here we extend the open clusters sequences towards fainter
magnitudes complementing the Gaia photometric and astrometric information with
near-infrared data from the VVV survey. We performed a homogeneous analysis on
37 open clusters implementing two coarse-to-fine characterization methods:
extreme deconvolution Gaussian mixture models coupled with an unsupervised
machine learning method on 8-dimensional parameter space. The process allowed
us to separate the clusters from the field at near-infrared wavelengths. We
report an increase of $\sim$47\% new member candidates on average in our sample
(considering only sources with high membership probability p$\geqq$0.9). This
study is the second in a series intended to reveal open cluster near-infrared
sequences homogeneously.

Title:Relative Habitability of Exoplanet Systems with Two Giant Planets,"
Abstract:  The architecture of a planetary system can influence the habitability of a
planet via orbital effects, particularly in the areas of stability and
eccentricity. Some of these effects are readily apparent, particularly when
they occur on short timescales that are easily numerically calculable. However,
the appearance and evolution of life can take place on gigayear timescales,
long enough that secular effects become important. These effects are difficult
to investigate, as a direct integration requires significant computational
time. In this paper, we apply a semi-analytic framework in conjunction with
N-body integrations and predictive techniques to determine the relative
habitability for an Earth-like planet in a system with two giant companions
over a multidimensional parameter space. Relative habitability quantifies the
integrated habitability probability compared to a system containing only a
single Earth-like planet. We find trends with mass, eccentricity, location,
spacing, inclination, and alignment of the giant planets, including
configurations where the system is more habitable due to the giant planets. As
long as the system remains stable, a moderate eccentricity excitation of the
terrestrial planet can be beneficial by increasing the outer boundary of the
habitable zone through higher mean irradiance. In our simulations, the median
($\pm 1 \sigma$) habitable planet has an eccentricity of 0.11 (+0.16, -0.08),
though it started circular. Low-mass, widely separated, and moderately
eccentric perturbing giants can accomplish this, an ""ultra-habitable""
configuration of companions.

Title:Free Core Nutation and its relation to the Spin-Over Mode,"
Abstract:  The time-varying response of the Earth's and other planets' rotation to
external gravitational torques depends strongly on their internal structure. In
particular, the existence of the mode known as the Free Core Nutation in the
fluid core, is known to amplify the forced nutations in the near-diurnal
retrograde frequency band (as measured in the planetary frame of reference).
Due to their proximity in shape and frequency, this mode is sometimes equated
with the so-called Spin-Over Mode which denotes the free oscillation of a
steadily rotating ellipsoidal fluid core. Through a careful study of the freely
rotating two-layer planetary model with a rigid mantle and an inviscid fluid
core, we show that the Spin-Over Mode frequency corresponds to that where the
sum of the external and internal torques on the mantle are balanced, causing it
to rotate steadily. The presence of dissipation at the Core-Mantle Boundary
causes the Free Core Nutation to become damped and slightly offset its
resonance frequency. We show that this offset, which is $\approx-1$ day for the
Earth, can be interpreted as the result of the proximity of the Free Core
Nutation frequency to that of the Spin-Over Mode, which now corresponds to a
minimum in the magnitude of the transfer function for nutations. We also show
how this proximity leads to a slightly lower Quality factor for the resonance
than that compute from the usual formula. We conclude by discussing possible
implications of this mechanism for Mars, the Moon, and the long-term evolution
of the Earth.

Title:Multiwavelength Observations of the Blazar VER J0521+211 During an Elevated TeV Gamma-Ray State,"
Abstract:  We report on a long-lasting, elevated gamma-ray flux state from VER J0521+211
observed by VERITAS, MAGIC, and Fermi-LAT in 2013 and 2014. The peak integral
flux above 200 GeV measured with the nightly-binned light curve is $(8.8 \pm
0.4) \times 10^{-7} \;\text{ph}\;\text{m}^{-2}\; \text{s}^{-1}$, or ~37% of the
Crab Nebula flux. Multiwavelength observations from X-ray, UV, and optical
instruments are also presented. A moderate correlation between the X-ray and
TeV gamma-ray fluxes was observed, and the X-ray spectrum appeared harder when
the flux was higher. Using the gamma-ray spectrum and four models of the
extragalactic background light (EBL), a conservative 95% confidence upper limit
on the redshift of the source was found to be z<=0.31. Unlike the gamma-ray and
X-ray bands, the optical flux did not increase significantly during the studied
period compared to the archival low-state flux. The spectral variability from
optical to X-ray bands suggests that the synchrotron peak of the spectral
energy distribution (SED) may become broader during flaring states, which can
be adequately described with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model varying
the high-energy end of the underlying particle spectrum. The synchrotron peak
frequency of the SED, as well as the radio morphology of the jet from the
MOJAVE program, are consistent with the source being an
intermediate-frequency-peaked BL Lac object.

Abstract:  We determine the detection limits of the search for dwarf galaxies in the
Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) using the algorithm developed by
the PAndAS team. The recovery fractions of artificial dwarf galaxies are, as
expected, a strong function of physical size and luminosity and, to a lesser
extent, distance. We show that these recovery fractions vary strongly with
location in the surveyed area because of varying levels of contamination from
both the Milky Way foreground stars and the stellar halo of Andromeda. We
therefore provide recovery fractions that are a function of size, luminosity,
and location within the survey on a scale of 1 square degree. Overall, the
effective surface brightness for a 50-percent detection rate range between 28
and 30 mag per square arcsecond. This is in line with expectations for a search
that relies on photometric data that are as deep as the PAndAS survey. The
derived detection limits are an essential ingredient on the path to
constraining the global properties of Andromeda's system of satellite dwarf
galaxies and, more broadly, to provide constraints on dwarf galaxy formation
and evolution in a cosmological context.

Title:Wide Binaries from GAIA EDR3: preference for GR over MOND ?,"
Abstract:  Several recent studies have shown that velocity differences of very wide
binary stars, measured to high precision with GAIA, can potentially provide an
interesting test for modified-gravity theories which attempt to emulate dark
matter. These systems should be entirely Newtonian according to standard
dark-matter theories, while the predictions for MOND-like theories are
distinctly different, if the various observational issues can be overcome. Here
we provide an updated version of our 2019 study using the recent GAIA EDR3 data
release: we select a large sample of 73 159 candidate wide binary stars with
distance <300 parsec and magnitudes G<17 from GAIA EDR3, and estimate component
masses using a main-sequence mass-luminosity relation. We then examine the
frequency distribution of pairwise relative projected velocity (relative to
circular-orbit value) as a function of projected separation, compared to
simulations; as before, these distributions show a clear peak at a value close
to Newtonian expectations, along with a long 'tail' which extends to much
larger velocity ratios and may well be caused by hierarchical triple systems
with an unresolved or unseen third star. We then fit these observed
distributions with a simulated mixture of binary, triple and flyby populations,
for GR or MOND orbits, and find that standard gravity is somewhat preferred
over one specific implementation of MOND; though we have not yet explored the
full parameter space of triple population models and MOND versions. Improved
data from future GAIA releases, and followup of a subset of systems to better
characterise the triple population, should allow wide binaries to become a
decisive test of GR vs MOND in the future.

Abstract:  C/2017 K2 (PANSTARRS) is an Oort cloud comet previously observed to be active
at heliocentric distances r>20 au on what is likely its first passage through
the inner solar system. We observed the comet on 2021 March 19-20 at r=6.82 au
pre-perihelion and 8.35 deg phase angle with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST),
and obtained high spatial resolution photometry and polarimetry mapping the
properties of dust over the coma prior to the onset of water ice sublimation
activity on the nucleus. We found clear radial gradients in the color and
polarization of the coma: the F475W-F775W (g'-i') reflectance slope increased
from ~4.5% per 100 nm within ~10,000 km of the nucleus up to ~7% per 100 nm by
~50,000 km, while the negative polarization in F775W (i') strengthened from
about -2% to -3.5% over the same range. The radial intensity profiles moreover
strongly deviate from profiles simulated for stable dust grains. Near-infrared
imagery obtained with the Palomar Hale Telescope on 2021 May 18 at r=6.34 au
revealed a continued absence of micron-sized grains in the tail, but showed no
clear spatial gradient in JHKs colors. The observed patterns collectively
appear consistent with the inner coma being optically dominated by sublimating,
micron-sized water ice grains, unlike the tail of more stable, millimeter-sized
grains. Finally, we evaluated these results alongside other Oort cloud comets,
and found in a reanalysis of HST observations of C/2012 S1 (ISON) that the
near-nucleus polarimetric halo reported for that comet is likely an
observational artifact.

Title:Calibrated Gas Accretion and Orbital Migration of Protoplanets in 1D Disc Models,"
Abstract:  We aim to develop a simple prescription for migration and accretion in 1D
disc models, calibrated with results of 3D hydrodynamic simulations. Our focus
lies on non-self-gravitating discs, but we also discuss to what degree our
prescription could be applied when the discs are self-gravitating.
We study migration using torque densities. Our model for the torque density
is based on existing fitting formulas, which we subsequently modify to prevent
premature gap-opening. At higher planetary masses, we also apply torque
densities from hydrodynamic simulations directly to our 1D model. These torque
densities allow modelling the orbital evolution of an initially low-mass planet
that undergoes runaway-accretion to become a massive planet. The two-way
exchange of angular momentum between disc and planet is included. This leads to
a self-consistent treatment of gap formation that only relies on directly
accessible disc parameters. We present a formula for Bondi- and Hill- gas
accretion in the disc-limited regime. This formula is self-consistent in the
sense that mass is removed from the disc in the location from where it is
accreted.
We find that the resulting evolution in mass and semi-major axis in the 1D
framework is in good agreement with those from 3D hydrodynamical simulations
for a range of parameters.
Our prescription is valuable for simultaneously modelling migration and
accretion in 1D-models. We conclude that it is appropriate and beneficial to
apply torque densities from hydrodynamic simulations in 1D models, at least in
the parameter space we study here. More work is needed to in order to determine
whether our approach is also applicable in an even wider parameter space and in
situations with more complex disc thermodynamics, or when the disc is
self-gravitating.

Title:Kepler K2 and TESS observations of two magnetic cataclysmic variables: The new asynchronous polar SDSS J084617.11+245344.1 and Paloma,"
Abstract:  There have been relatively few published long-duration, uninterrupted light
curves of magnetic cataclysmic variable stars in which the accreting white
dwarf's rotational frequency is slightly desynchronized from the binary orbital
frequency (asynchronous polars). We report Kepler K2 and TESS observations of
two such systems. The first, SDSS J084617.11+245344.1, was observed by the
Kepler spacecraft for 80 days during Campaign 16 of the K2 mission, and we
identify it as a new asynchronous polar with a likely 4.64 h orbital period.
This is significantly longer than any other asynchronous polar, as well as all
but several synchronous polars. Its spin and orbital periods beat against each
other to produce a conspicuous 6.77 d beat period, across which the system's
accretion geometry gradually changes. The second system in this study, Paloma,
was observed by TESS for one sector and was already known to be asynchronous.
Until now, there had been an ambiguity in its spin period, but the TESS power
spectrum pinpoints a spin period of 2.27 h. During the resulting 0.7 d
spin-orbit beat period, the light curve phased on the spin modulation
alternates between being single- and double-humped. We explore two possible
explanations for this behavior: the accretion flow being diverted from one of
the poles for part of the beat cycle, or an eclipse of the emitting region
responsible for the second hump.

"Title:Deep two-phase, hemispherical magma oceans on lava planets","
Abstract:  Astronomers have discovered a handful of exoplanets with rocky bulk
compositions but orbiting so close to their host star that the surface of the
planet must be at least partially molten. It is expected that the dayside of
such ""lava planets"" harbors a rock vapor atmosphere that flows quickly towards
the airless nightside -- this partial atmosphere is critical to the
interpretation of lava planet observations, but transports negligible heat
towards the nightside. As a result, the surface temperature of the magma ocean
may range from 3000~K near the sub-stellar point down to 1500~K near the
day-night terminator. We use simple models incorporating the thermodynamics and
geochemistry of partial melt to predict the physical and chemical properties of
the magma ocean as a function of the distance from the sub-stellar point. Our
two principal findings are that 1) the dayside magma ocean is much deeper than
previously thought, probably extending down to the core-mantle boundary in some
locations, and 2) much of the dayside is only partially molten, leading to
gradients in the surface chemistry of the magma ocean. These findings have
important implications for the dynamics of the magma ocean as well as the
composition and dynamics of the atmosphere.

"Title:Timing six energetic rotation-powered X-ray pulsars, including the fast-spinning young PSR J0058-7218 and Big Glitcher PSR J0537-6910","
Abstract:  Measuring a pulsar's rotational evolution is crucial to understanding the
nature of the pulsar. Here we provide updated timing models for the rotational
evolution of six pulsars, five of which are rotation phase-connected using
primarily NICER X-ray data. For the newly-discovered fast energetic young
pulsar, PSR J0058-7218, we increase the baseline of its timing model from 1.4
days to 8 months and not only measure more precisely its spin-down rate nudot =
(-6.2324+/-0.0001)x10^-11 Hz s^-1 but also for the first time the second time
derivative of spin rate nuddot = (4.2+/-0.2)x10^-21 Hz s^-2. For the fastest
and most energetic young pulsar, PSR J0537-6910 (with 16 ms spin period), we
detect 4 more glitches, for a total of 15 glitches over 4.5 years of NICER
monitoring, and show that its spin-down behavior continues to set this pulsar
apart from all others, including a long-term braking index n = -1.234+/-0.009
and interglitch braking indices that asymptote to <~ 7 for long times after a
glitch. For PSR J1101-6101, we measure a much more accurate spin-down rate that
agrees with a previous value measured without phase-connection. For PSR
J1412+7922 (also known as Calvera), we extend the baseline of its timing model
from our previous 1-year model to 4.4 years, and for PSR J1849-0001, we extend
the baseline from 1.5 years to 4.7 years. We also present a long-term timing
model of the energetic pulsar, PSR J1813-1749, by fitting previous radio and
X-ray spin frequencies from 2009-2019 and new ones measured here using 2018

Title:Euclid preparation. XXI. Intermediate-redshift contaminants in the search for $z>6$ galaxies within the Euclid Deep Survey,"
Abstract:  (Abridged) The Euclid mission is expected to discover thousands of z>6
galaxies in three Deep Fields, which together will cover a ~40 deg2 area.
However, the limited number of Euclid bands and availability of ancillary data
could make the identification of z>6 galaxies challenging. In this work, we
assess the degree of contamination by intermediate-redshift galaxies (z=1-5.8)
expected for z>6 galaxies within the Euclid Deep Survey. This study is based on
~176,000 real galaxies at z=1-8 in a ~0.7 deg2 area selected from the
UltraVISTA ultra-deep survey, and ~96,000 mock galaxies with 25.3$\leq$H<27.0,
which altogether cover the range of magnitudes to be probed in the Euclid Deep
Survey. We simulate Euclid and ancillary photometry from the fiducial, 28-band
photometry, and fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to various
combinations of these simulated data. Our study demonstrates that identifying
z>6 with Euclid data alone will be very effective, with a z>6 recovery of
91(88)% for bright (faint) galaxies. For the UltraVISTA-like bright sample, the
percentage of z=1-5.8 contaminants amongst apparent z>6 galaxies as observed
with Euclid alone is 18%, which is reduced to 4(13)% by including ultra-deep
Rubin (Spitzer) photometry. Conversely, for the faint mock sample, the
contamination fraction with Euclid alone is considerably higher at 39%, and
minimized to 7% when including ultra-deep Rubin data. For UltraVISTA-like
bright galaxies, we find that Euclid (I-Y)>2.8 and (Y-J)<1.4 colour criteria
can separate contaminants from true z>6 galaxies, although these are applicable
to only 54% of the contaminants, as many have unconstrained (I-Y) colours. In
the most optimistic scenario, these cuts reduce the contamination fraction to
1% whilst preserving 81% of the fiducial z>6 sample. For the faint mock sample,
colour cuts are infeasible.

Title:Moderately High Obliquity Promotes Biospheric Oxygenation,"
Abstract:  Planetary obliquity is a first order control on planetary climate and
seasonal contrast, which has a number of cascading consequences for life. How
moderately high obliquity (obliquities greater than Earth's current obliquity
up to 45$^{\circ}$) affects a planet's surface physically has been studied
previously, but we lack an understanding of how marine life will respond to
these conditions. We couple the ROCKE-3D general circulation model to the
cGENIE 3D biogeochemical model to simulate the ocean biosphere's response to
various planetary obliquities, bioessential nutrient inventories, and
biospheric structure. We find that the net rate of photosynthesis increased by
35$\%$ and sea-to-air flux of biogenic oxygen doubled between the 0$^{\circ}$
and 45$^{\circ}$ obliquity scenarios, which is an equivalent response to
doubling bioessential nutrients. Our results suggest that moderately
high-obliquity planets have higher potential for biospheric oxygenation than
their low-obliquity counterparts and that life on moderately high-obliquity
habitable planets may be easier to detect with next generation telescopes.
These moderately high-obliquity habitable planets may also be more conducive to
the evolution of complex life.

Title:SN 2009ip after a decade: The luminous blue variable progenitor is now gone,"
Abstract:  We present new HST imaging photometry for the site of the Type IIn supernova
(SN) 2009ip taken almost a decade after explosion. The optical source has
continued to fade steadily since the SN-like event in 2012. In the F606W
filter, which was also used to detect its luminous blue variable (LBV)
progenitor 13~yr before the SN, the source at the position of SN2009ip is now
1.2mag fainter than that quiescent progenitor. It is 6-7mag fainter than the
pre-SN outbursts in 2009--2011. This definitively rules out a prediction that
the source would return to its previous state after surviving the 2012 event.
Instead, the late-time fading matches expectations for a terminal explosion.
The source fades at a similar rate in all visual-wavelength filters without
significant color changes, therefore also ruling out the hypothesis of a
luminous dust-obscured survivor or transition to a hotter post-LBV survivor.
The late-time continuum with steady color and strong H$\alpha$ emission
detected in a narrow F657N filter are, however, entirely expected for ongoing
shock interaction with circumstellar material in a decade-old core-collapse SN.
Interestingly, the ultraviolet flux has stayed nearly constant since 2015,
supporting previous conjectures that the F275W light traces main-sequence OB
stars in an underlying young star cluster. We expect that the visual-wavelength
continuum will eventually level off, tracing this cluster light. Without any
additional outbursts, it seems prudent to consider the 2012 event as a terminal
SN explosion, and we discuss plausible scenarios.

Title:Cosmological informed neural networks to solve the background dynamics of the Universe,"
Abstract:  The field of machine learning has drawn increasing interest from various
other fields due to the success of its methods at solving a plethora of
different problems. An application of these has been to train artificial neural
networks to solve differential equations without the need of a numerical
solver. This particular application offers an alternative to conventional
numerical methods, with advantages such as lower memory required to store the
solutions, parallelization, and in some cases less overall computational cost
than its numerical counterparts. In this work, we train artificial neural
networks to represent a bundle of solutions of the differential equations that
govern the background dynamics of the Universe for four different models. The
models we have chosen are $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, the
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametric dark energy model, a quintessence model
with an exponential potential, and the Hu-Sawicki $f\left(R\right)$ model. We
used the solutions that the networks provide to perform statistical analyses to
estimate the values of each model's parameters with observational data; namely,
estimates of the Hubble parameter from Cosmic Chronometers, the Supernovae type
Ia data from the Pantheon compilation, and measurements from Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations. The results we obtain for all models match similar estimations
done in the literature using numerical solvers. In addition, we estimated the
error of the solutions by comparing them to the analytical solution when there
is one, or to a high-precision numerical solution when there is not. Through
those estimations we found that the error of the solutions was at most
$\sim1\%$ in the region of the parameter space that concerns the $95\%$
confidence regions that we found using the data, for all models and all
statistical analyses performed in this work.

Title:A Random Walk Model for Halo Triaxiality,"
Abstract:  We describe a semi-analytic model to predict the triaxial shapes of dark
matter halos utilizing the sequences of random merging events captured in
merger trees to follow the evolution of each halo's energy tensor. When coupled
with a simple model for relaxation toward a spherical shape, we find that this
model predicts distributions of halo axis length ratios which approximately
agree with those measured from cosmological N-body simulations once constrained
to match the median axis ratio at a single halo mass. We demonstrate the
predictive and explanatory power of this model by considering conditioned
distributions of axis length ratios, and the mass-dependence of halo shapes,
finding these to be in good agreement with N-body results. This model provides
both insight into the physics driving the evolution of halo triaxial shapes,
and rapid quantitative predictions for the statistics of triaxiality connected
directly to the formation history of the halo.

Title:Gravothermal solutions of SIDM halos: mapping from constant to velocity-dependent cross section,"
Abstract:  The scale-free gravothermal fluid formalism has long proved effective in
describing the evolution of self-interacting dark matter halos with a constant
dark matter particle cross section. However, whether the gravothermal fluid
solutions match numerical simulations for velocity-dependent cross-section
scenarios remains untested. In this work, we provide a fast mapping method that
relates the constant-cross-section gravothermal solution to models with
arbitrary velocity dependence in the cross section. We show that the
gravothermal solutions after mapping are in good agreement with Arepo N-Body
simulation results. We illustrate the power of this approach by applying this
fast mapping method to a halo hosting a low surface brightness galaxy UGC 128.
We show that this fast mapping method can be used to constrain free parameters
in a physically motivated cross-section model and illustrate parameter space
favored by the rotation curve measurement.

Title:Stochastic effects on observation of ultralight bosonic dark matter,"
Abstract:  Ultralight bosonic particles are fascinating candidates of dark matter (DM).
It behaves as classical waves in our Galaxy due to its large number density.
There have been various methods proposed to search for the wave-like DM, such
as methods utilizing interferometric gravitational-wave detectors.
Understanding the characteristics of DM signals is crucial to extract the
properties of DM from data. While the DM signal is nearly monochromatic with
the angular frequency of its mass, the amplitude and phase are gradually
changing due to the velocity dispersion of DMs in our Galaxy halo. The
stochastic amplitude and phase should be properly taken into account to
accurately constrain the coupling constant of DM from data. Previous works
formulated a method to obtain the upper bound on the coupling constant
incorporating the stochastic effects. One of these works compared the upper
bound with and without the stochastic effect in a measurement time that is much
shorter than the variation time scale of the amplitude and phase. In this
paper, we extend their formulation to arbitrary measurement time and evaluate
the stochastic effects. Moreover, we investigate the velocity-dependent signal
for dark photon DM including an uncertainly of the velocity. We demonstrate
that our method accurately estimates the upper bound on the coupling constant
with numerical simulations. We also estimate the expected upper bound of the
coupling constant of axion DM and dark photon DM from future experiments in a
semi-analytic way. The stochasticity especially affects constraints on a small
mass region. Our formulation offers a generic treatment of the ultralight
bosonic DM signal with the stochastic effect.

"Title:GRB 201104A: A ""Repetitive"" Short Gamma-Ray Burst?","
Abstract:  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are divided into short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and
long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) based on the bimodal distribution of their
durations. LGRBs and SGRBs are typically characterized by different statistical
characteristics. Nevertheless, there are some samples that challenge such a
framework, such as GRB 060614, a long-duration burst with short-burst
characteristics. Furthermore, GRBs are generally considered to be an event with
no periodic or repetitive behavior, since the progenitors usually undergo
destructive events, such as massive explosions or binary compact star mergers.
In this work, we investigated Fermi data for possible quasiperiodic
oscillations and repetitive behaviors of GRBs using timing analysis methods and
report a special event GRB 201104A, which is a long-duration burst with the
characteristics of an SGRB, and it exhibits a ""repetitive"" behavior. We propose
that such a situation may arise from lensed SGRBs and attempt to verify it by
Bayesian inference. In addition, we extend the spectral analysis to Bayesian
inference. In spite of the existence of at least two distinct time periods with
a nearly identical spectrum, there is no strong evidence that they result from
a lensing GRB. Taking the gravitational-lensing scenario out of consideration,
a long burst would resemble a short burst in its repetitive behavior, which
presents a challenge for the current classification scheme.

Title:Properties and Energetics of Magnetic Reconnection: I. Evolution of Flare Ribbons,"
Abstract:  In this article, we measure the mean magnetic shear from the morphological
evolution of flare ribbons, and examine the evolution of flare thermal and
non-thermal X-ray emissions during the progress of flare reconnection. We
analyze three eruptive flares and three confined flares ranging from GOES class
C8.0 to M7.0. They exhibit well-defined two ribbons along the magnetic polarity
inversion line (PIL), and have been observed by the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly and the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager from the onset
of the flare throughout the impulsive phase. The analysis confirms the
strong-to-weak shear evolution in the core region of the flare, and the flare
hard X-ray emission rises as the shear decreases. In eruptive flares in this
sample, significant non-thermal hard X-ray emission lags the ultraviolet
emission from flare ribbons, and rises rapidly when the shear is modest. In all
flares, we observe that the plasma temperature rises in the early phase when
the flare ribbons rapidly spread along the PIL and the shear is high. We
compare these results with prior studies, and discuss their implications, as
well as complications, related to physical mechanisms governing energy
partition during flare reconnection.

Abstract:  With the availability of large-scale surveys like Kepler and TESS, there is a
pressing need for automated methods to classify light curves according to known
classes of variable stars. We introduce a new algorithm for classifying light
curves that compares 7000 time-series features to find those which most
effectively classify a given set of light curves. We apply our method to Kepler
light curves for stars with effective temperatures in the range 6500--10,000K.
We show that the sample can be meaningfully represented in an interpretable
five-dimensional feature space that separates seven major classes of light
curves (delta Scuti stars, gamma Doradus stars, RR Lyrae stars, rotational
variables, contact eclipsing binaries, detached eclipsing binaries, and
non-variables). We achieve a balanced classification accuracy of 82% on an
independent test set of Kepler stars using a Gaussian mixture model classifier.
We use our method to classify 12,000 Kepler light curves from Quarter 9 and
provide a catalogue of the results. We further outline a confidence heuristic
based on probability density with which to search our catalogue, and extract
candidate lists of correctly-classified variable stars.

Title:Simple interpretation of the seemingly complicated X-ray spectral variation of NGC 5548,"
Abstract:  NGC 5548 is a very well-studied Seyfert 1 galaxy in broad wavelengths.
Previous multiwavelength observation campaigns have indicated that its multiple
absorbers are highly variable and complex. A previous study applied a two-zone
partial covering model with different covering fractions to explain the complex
X-ray spectral variation and reported a correlation between one of the covering
fractions and the photon index of the power-law continuum. However, it is not
straightforward to physically understand such a correlation. In this paper, we
propose a model to avoid this unphysical situation; the central X-ray emission
region is partially covered by clumpy absorbers composed of double layers.
These ""double partial coverings"" have precisely the same covering fraction.
Based on our model, we have conducted an extensive spectral study using the
data taken by XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and NuSTAR in the range of 0.3-78 keV for 16
years. Consequently, we have found that the X-ray spectral variations are
mainly explained by independent changes of the following three components; (1)
the soft excess spectral component below ~1 keV, (2) the cut-off power-law
normalization, and (3) the partial covering fraction of the clumpy absorbers.
In particular, spectral variations above ~1 keV are mostly explained only by
the changes of the partial covering fraction and the power-law normalization.
In contrast, the photon index and all the other spectral parameters are not
significantly variable.

Title:XMM-Newton and Swift observations of supergiant high mass X-ray binaries,"
Abstract:  Wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries are precious laboratories not only to
study accretion under extreme gravity and magnetic field conditions, but also
to probe still highly debated properties of massive star winds. These includes
the so-called clumps, originated from the inherent instability of line driven
winds, and larger structures. In this paper, we report on the results of the
last (and not yet published) monitoring campaigns that our group has been
carrying out since 2007 with both XMM-Newton and the Swift Neil Gehrels
observatory. Data collected with the EPIC cameras on-board XMM-Newton allow us
to carry out a detailed hardness ratio-resolved spectral analysis that can be
used as an efficient way to detect spectral variations associated to the
presence of clumps. Long-term observations with the XRT on-board Swift, evenly
sampling the X-ray emission of supergiant X-ray binaries over many different
orbital cycles, are exploited to look for the presence of large scale
structures in the medium surrounding the compact objects. The results reported
in this paper represent the outcomes of the concluded observational campaigns
we carried out on the supergiant X-ray binaries 4U 1907+09, IGR J16393-4643,
IGR J19140+0951, and XTE J1855-026, as well as the supergiant fast X-ray
transients IGR J17503-2636, IGR J18410-0535, and IGR J11215-5952. All results
are discussed in the context of wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries and shall
ideally serve to optimally shape the next observational campaigns aimed at
sources in the same classes. We show in one of the paper appendices that IGR
J17315-3221, preliminary classified in the literature as a possible supergiant
X-ray binary discovered by INTEGRAL, is the product of a data analysis artifact
and should thus be disregarded for future studies.

extended atmosphere. The H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines have a P Cyg type
profile; their wind absorption changes position in the range from $-270$ to
$-290$ km/s. The intensity of the H$\alpha$ emission reaches record values with
respect to the local continuum: I/Icont $\approx$70. The stationary radial
velocity according to the positions of symmetric forbidden emissions and
permitted metal emissions was taken as the systemic velocity
Vsys=$-149.6\pm$0.6 km/s. Based on the positions of absorptions of NII and OII
ions, a time variability of the radial velocity in the range from $-127.2$ to
$-178.3$ km/s was found for the first time for this star. This variability
indicates the possible presence of a companion and/or atmospheric pulsations.
The change of the oxygen triplet profile OI 7775 A due to the occurrence of
unstable emission was registered. The set of interstellar absorptions of the
NaI D-lines profile in the range from $-10.0$ to $-167.2$ km/s is formed in the

Title:Semi-analytic spectral fitting: simultaneously modelling the mass accumulation and chemical evolution in MaNGA spiral galaxies,"
Abstract:  We develop a novel semi-analytic spectral fitting approach to quantify the
star-formation histories (SFHs) and chemical enrichment histories (ChEHs) of
individual galaxies. We construct simple yet general chemical evolution models
that account for gas inflow and outflow processes as well as star formation, to
investigate the evolution of merger-free star-forming systems. These models are
fitted directly to galaxies' absorption-line spectra, while their emission
lines are used to constrain current gas phase metallicity and star formation
rate. We apply this method to spiral galaxies selected from the SDSS-IV MaNGA
survey. By fitting the co-added absorption-line spectra for each galaxy, and
using the emission-line constraints on present-day metallicity and star
formation, we reconstruct both the SFHs and the ChEHs for all objects in the
sample. We can use these reconstructions to obtain archaeological measures of
derived correlations such as the mass--metallicity relation at any redshift,
which compare favourably with direct observations. We find that both the SFHs
and ChEHs have strong mass dependence: massive galaxies accumulate their
stellar masses and become enriched earlier. This mass dependence causes the
observed flattening of the mass--metallicity relation at lower redshifts. The
model also reproduces the observed gas-to-stellar mass ratio and its mass
dependence. Moreover, we are able to determine that more massive galaxies have
earlier gas infall times and shorter infall time-scales, and that the early
chemical enrichment of low-mass galaxies is suppressed by strong outflows,
while outflows are not very significant in massive galaxies.

Abstract:  We explore indirect methods to detect Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)
in gas-rich, absorption-selected galaxies at high redshift. We look at the
optical VLT/X-shooter observations of an intervening, extremely strong damped
Lyman-alpha absorber (or ESDLA, with log(N(HI))>~21.7)) towards QSO SDSS
J1143+1420 at redshift, z(ESDLA)=2.323. Literature studies have shown that this
ESDLA contains signatures of dust and diffuse molecular hydrogen and it was
specifically chosen for our study due to its close spatial proximity (impact
parameter, rho=0.6+/-0.3 kpc) with its associated galaxy. There is no direct
detection of PAHs emission in the limited observations of infrared(IR)-spectra
along this sight-line. Hence, we use CLOUDY numerical simulation modelling to
indirectly probe the presence of PAH in the ESDLA. We note that PAHs need to be
included in the models to reproduce the observed column densities of warm H2
and CI. Thus, we infer the presence of PAHs indirectly in our ESDLA, with an
abundance of PAH/H = 10^(-7.046). We also measure a low 2175 A bump strength
(E(bump)~0.03-0.19 mag) relative to star-forming galaxies by modelling
extinction of QSO spectra by dust at the absorber rest-frame. This is
consistent with the low PAH abundance obtained indirectly using CLOUDY
modelling. Our study highlights the usage of CLOUDY modelling to indirectly
detect PAH in high-redshift gas-rich absorption-selected galaxies.

Title:Oscillatory reconnection and waves driven by merging magnetic flux ropes in solar flares,"
Abstract:  Oscillatory reconnection is a process that has been suggested to underlie
several solar and stellar phenomena, and is likely to play an important role in
transient events such as flares. Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in flare
emissions may be a manifestation of oscillatory reconnection, but the
underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. In this paper, we present 2D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of two current-carrying magnetic flux
ropes with an out-of-plane magnetic field undergoing oscillatory reconnection
in which the two flux ropes merge into a single flux rope. We find that
oscillatory reconnection can occur intrinsically without an external
oscillatory driver during flux rope coalescence, which may occur both during
large-scale coronal loop interactions and the merging of plasmoids in
fragmented current sheets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that radially
propagating non-linear waves are produced in the aftermath of flux rope
coalescence, due to the post-reconnection oscillations of the merged flux rope.
The behaviour of these waves is found to be almost independent of the initial
out-of-plane magnetic field. It is estimated that the waves emitted through
merging coronal loops and merging plasmoids in loop-top current sheets would
have a typical phase speed of 90 km/s and 900 km/s respectively. It is possible
that the properties of the waves emitted during flux rope coalescence could be
used as a diagnostic tool to determine physical parameters within a coalescing
region.

Abstract:  Spectropolarimetric data allow for simultaneous monitoring of stellar
chromospheric $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$ activity and the surface-averaged
longitudinal magnetic field, $B_l$, giving the opportunity to probe the
relationship between large-scale stellar magnetic fields and chromospheric
manifestations of magnetism. We present $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$ and/or
$B_l$ measurements for 954 mid-F to mid-M stars derived from
spectropolarimetric observations contained within the PolarBase database. Our
magnetically active sample complements previous stellar activity surveys that
focus on inactive planet-search targets. We find a positive correlation between
mean $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$ and mean $\log|B_l|$, but for G stars the
relationship may undergo a change between $\log{R'_{\rm{HK}}}\sim-4.4$ and
$-4.8$. The mean $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$ shows a similar change with
respect to the $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$ variability amplitude for
intermediately-active G stars. We also combine our results with archival
chromospheric activity data and published observations of large-scale magnetic
field geometries derived using Zeeman Doppler Imaging. The chromospheric
activity data indicate a slight under-density of late-F to early-K stars with
$-4.75\leq\log{R'_{\rm HK}}\leq-4.5$. This is not as prominent as the original
Vaughan-Preston gap, and we do not detect similar under-populated regions in
the distributions of the mean $|B_l|$, or the $B_l$ and $\log{R'_{\rm HK}}$
variability amplitudes. Chromospheric activity, activity variability and
toroidal field strength decrease on the main sequence as rotation slows. For G
stars, the disappearance of dominant toroidal fields occurs at a similar
chromospheric activity level as the change in the relationships between
chromospheric activity, activity variability and mean field strength.

Title:Modeling Balmer line signatures of stellar CMEs,"
Abstract:  From the Sun we know that coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a transient
phenomenon, often correlated with flares. They have an impact on solar mass-
and angular momentum loss, and therefore solar evolution, and make a
significant part of space weather. The same is true for stars, but stellar CMEs
are still not well constrained, although new methodologies have been
established, and new detections presented in the recent past. So far, probable
detections of stellar CMEs have been presented, but their physical parameters
which are not directly accessible from observations, such as electron density,
optical thickness, temperature, etc., have been so far not determined for the
majority of known events. We apply cloud modeling, as commonly used on the Sun,
to a known event from the literature, detected on the young dMe star V374 Peg.
This event manifests itself in extra emission on the blue side of the Balmer
lines. By determining the line source function from 1D NLTE modeling together
with the cloud model formulation we present distributions of physical
parameters of this event. We find that except for temperature and area all
parameters are at the upper range of typical solar prominence parameters. The
temperature and the area of the event were found to be higher than for typical
solar prominences observed in Balmer lines. We find more solutions for the
filament than for the prominence geometry. Moreover we show that filaments can
appear in emission on dMe stars contrary to the solar case.

Title:Search for new cosmic-ray acceleration sites within the 4FGL catalog Galactic plane sources,"
Abstract:  Cosmic rays are mostly composed of protons accelerated to relativistic
speeds. When those protons encounter interstellar material, they produce
neutral pions which in turn decay into gamma rays. This offers a compelling way
to identify the acceleration sites of protons. A characteristic hadronic
spectrum, with a low-energy break around 200 MeV, was detected in the gamma-ray
spectra of four Supernova Remnants (SNRs), IC 443, W44, W49B and W51C, with the
Fermi Large Area Telescope. This detection provided direct evidence that
cosmic-ray protons are (re-)accelerated in SNRs. Here, we present a
comprehensive search for low-energy spectral breaks among 311 4FGL catalog
sources located within 5 degrees from the Galactic plane. Using 8 years of data
from the Fermi Large Area Telescope between 50 MeV and 1 GeV, we find and
present the spectral characteristics of 56 sources with a spectral break
confirmed by a thorough study of systematic uncertainty. Our population of
sources includes 13 SNRs for which the proton-proton interaction is enhanced by
the dense target material; the high-mass gamma-ray binary LS~I +61 303; the
colliding wind binary eta Carinae; and the Cygnus star-forming region. This
analysis better constrains the origin of the gamma-ray emission and enlarges
our view to potential new cosmic-ray acceleration sites.

Title:Improved background model for the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) instrument on-board AstroSat,"
Abstract:  We present an improved background model for the Large Area X-ray Proportional
Counter (LAXPC) detectors on-board AstroSat. Because of the large collecting
area and high pressure, the LAXPC instrument has a large background count rate,
which varies during the orbit. Apart from the variation with latitude and
longitude during the orbit there is a prominent quasi-diurnal variation which
has not been modelled earlier. Using over 5 years of background observations,
we determined the period of the quasi-diurnal variation to be 84495 s and using
this period, it is possible to account for the variation and also identify time
intervals where the fit is not good. These lead to a significant improvement in
the background model. The quasi-diurnal variation can be ascribed to the
changes in charged particle flux in the near Earth orbit.

Title:Origin of eclipsing time variations in Post-Common-Envelope binaries: role of the centrifugal force,"
Abstract:  Eclipsing time variations (ETVs) in post-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs)
were proposed to be due to the time-varying component of the stellar
gravitational quadrupole moment. This is suggested to be produced by changes in
the stellar structure due to an internal redistribution of angular momentum and
the effect of the centrifugal force. We examined this hypothesis and present 3D
simulations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) performed with the {\sc
Pencil Code}. We modeled the stellar dynamo for a solar-mass star with angular
velocities of 20 and 30 times solar. We included and varied the strength of the
centrifugal force and compared the results with reference simulations without
the centrifugal force and with a simulation in which its effect is enhanced.
The centrifugal force causes perturbations in the evolution of the numerical
model, so that the outcome in the details becomes different as a result of
nonlinear evolution. While the average density profile is unaffected by the
centrifugal force, a relative change in the density difference between high
latitudes and the equator of $\sim10^{-4}$ is found. The power spectrum of the
convective velocity is found to be more sensitive to the angular velocity than
to the strength of the centrifugal force. The quadrupole moment of the stars
includes a fluctuating and a time-independent component, which vary with the
rotation rate. As very similar behavior is produced in absence of the
centrifugal force, we conclude that it is not the main ingredient for producing
the time-averaged and fluctuating quadrupole moment of the star. In a real
physical system, we thus expect contributions from both components, that is,
from the time-dependent gravitational force from the variation in the
quadrupole term and from the spin-orbit coupling that is due to the persistent
part of the quadrupole.

Title:Horizontal motions in sunspot penubrae,"
Abstract:  High-resolution observations of horizontal motions in the penumbra are needed
to complement the concept of penumbrae obtained from spectropolarimetry. Time
series of intensity images of a large sunspot in AR 10634 acquired with the
Swedish Solar Telescope in the G band and red continuum are analysed. The two
simultaneous time series last six hours and five minutes. Horizontal motions of
penumbral grains (PGs), structures in dark bodies of filaments, the outer
penumbral border, and G-band bright points are measured in time slices that
cover the whole width of the penumbra and the neighbouring granulation. The
spatial and temporal resolutions are 90 km and 20.1 s, respectively. In the
inner penumbra, PGs move toward the umbra (inwards) with a mean speed of -0.7
km s-1. The direction of motion changes from inwards to outwards at
approximately 60% of the penumbral width and the mean speed increases gradually
in the outer penumbra, approaching 0.5 km/s. This speed is also typical of an
expansion of the penumbra-granulation border during periods that typically last
one hour and are followed by a fast contraction. The majority of the G-band
bright points moves away from the sunspot, with a typical speed of 0.6 km/s.
High outward speeds, 3.6 km/s on average, are observed in dark bodies of
penumbral filaments. According to the model of penumbral filaments, it is
suggested that the speeds detected in the dark bodies of filaments are
associated with the Evershed flow and that the opposite directions of PG
motions in the inner and outer penumbrae may be explained by the interaction of
rising plasma in filament heads with a surrounding, differently inclined
magnetic field.

Title:VLBI imaging of the pre-coalescence SMBHB candidate SDSS J143016.05+230344.4,"
Abstract:  Context. Recently, SDSS J143016.05+230344.4 (J1430+2303) was reported to be a
supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the final coalescence phase. It is
probably the first SMBHB coalescence event observable in human history. Radio
observations of J1430+2303 before and after coalescence will provide a unique
diagnosis of the energetics and environment of the SMBHB.
Aims. We explore the radio emission from the galactic nucleus region that is
closely related to the current X-ray and optical activities and helps to
understand the state of black hole accretion and outflow before coalescence.
Methods. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging is the only method
that offers milli-arcsecond-level high resolution that can exclude the
contamination by diffuse emission on galactic scales. We observed J1430+2303
with the European VLBI Network at 1.7 GHz and with the Very Long Baseline Array
at 1.6 and 4.9 GHz in late February and early March 2022.
Results. A compact component is detected in all three VLBI images. It has a
brightness temperature of > 10^8 K, an unresolved morphology with a size < 0.8
pc, and a flat radio spectrum. These observational features are inconsistent
with large opening-angle outflows or winds, but indicate that this compact
component might be a jet or a corona. Nearly 60% of the emission is resolved by
VLBI and may come from remnant lobes of previous radio activities, the outer
layers of a structured jet, or shocks formed by the disc winds in the narrow
line region.
Conclusions. Current VLBI images do not yet show signs of radio outbursts.
Our observations provide pre-coalescence radio data that are an important
reference for future comparative studies with the post-merger. In particular,
further resolving the jet will pave the way for probing the dynamical features
associated with inspiralling binary black holes.

Title:Density Exponent Analysis: Gravity-driven steepening of the density profiles of star-forming regions,"
Abstract:  The evolution of molecular interstellar clouds is a complex, multi-scale
process. The power-law density exponent describes the steepness of density
profiles, and it has been used to characterize the density structures of the
clouds yet its usage is usually limited to spherically symmetric systems.
Importing the Level-Set Method, we develop a new formalism that generates
robust maps of a generalized density exponent $k_{\rho}$ at every location for
complex density distributions. By applying it to high fidelity, high dynamical
range map of the Perseus molecular cloud constructed using data from the
Herschel and Planck satellites, we find that the density exponent exhibits a
surprisingly wide range of variation ($-3.5 \lesssim k_{\rho} \lesssim -0.5$).
Regions at later stages of gravitational collapse are associated with steeper
density profiles. Inside a region, gas located in the vicinities of dense
structures has very steep density profiles with $k_{\rho} \approx -3$, which
forms because of depletion. This density exponent analysis reveals diverse
density structures, forming a coherent picture that gravitational collapse
leads to a continued steepening of the density profile. We expect our method to
be effective in studying other power-law-like density structures, including
granular materials and the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe.

"Title:Discovery of a coherent, wave-like velocity pattern for the Radcliffe Wave","
Abstract:  Recently studies discovered that part of the Gould Belt belongs to a 2.7
kpc-long {coherent, thin} wave consisting of a chain of clouds, where a damped
undulation pattern has been identified from the spatial arrangement of the
clouds. We use the proper motions of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) anchored
inside the clouds to study the kinematic structure of the Radcliffe Wave in
terms of $v_z$, and identify a damped, wave-like pattern from the $v_z$ space,
which we call ""velocity undulation"". We propose a new formalism based on the
Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to determine the amplitude,
period, and phase of the undulation pattern, and find that the spatial and the
velocity undulation share an almost identical spatial frequency of about 1.5
kpc, and both are damped when measured from one side to the other. Measured for
the first cycle, they exhibit a phase difference of around $2\pi/3$. The
structure is oscillating around the midplane of the Milky Way disk with an
amplitude of $\sim\,130\,\pm\,20\,\rm pc$. The vertical extent of the Radcliffe
Wave exceeds the thickness of the molecular disk, suggesting that the
undulation of the undulation signature might originate from a perturbation,
e.g. the passage of a dwarf galaxy.

Title:The 2021 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi observed in X-rays by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory: a comparative study,"
Abstract:  On 2021 August 8, the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi erupted again, after an
interval of 15.5 yr. Regular monitoring by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
began promptly, on August 9.9 (0.37 day after the optical peak), and continued
until the source passed behind the Sun at the start of November, 86 days later.
Observations then restarted on day 197, once RS Oph emerged from the Sun
constraint. This makes RS Oph the first Galactic recurrent nova to have been
monitored by Swift throughout two eruptions. Here we investigate the extensive
X-ray datasets from 2006 and 2021, as well as the more limited data collected
by EXOSAT in 1985. The hard X-rays arising from shock interactions between the
nova ejecta and red giant wind are similar following the last two eruptions. In
contrast, the early super-soft source (SSS) in 2021 was both less variable and
significantly fainter than in 2006. However, 0.3-1 keV light-curves from 2021
reveal a 35 s quasi-periodic oscillation consistent in frequency with the 2006
data. The Swift X-ray spectra from 2021 are featureless, with the soft emission
typically being well parametrized by a simple blackbody, while the 2006 spectra
showed much stronger evidence for superimposed ionized absorption edges.
Considering the data after day 60 following each eruption, during the supersoft
phase the 2021 spectra are hotter, with smaller effective radii and lower wind
absorption, leading to an apparently reduced bolometric luminosity. We explore
possible explanations for the gross differences in observed SSS behaviour
between the 2006 and 2021 outbursts.

Title:Observational constraints of an anisotropic boost due to the projection effects using redMaPPer clusters,"
Abstract:  Optical clusters identified from red-sequence galaxies suffer from projection
effects, where interloper galaxies along the line-of-sight to a cluster are
mistaken as genuine members of the cluster. In the previous study (Sunayama et
al. 2020), we found that the projection effects cause the boost on the
amplitudes of clustering and lensing on large scale compared to the expected
amplitudes in the absence of any projection effects. These boosts are caused by
preferential selections of filamentary structure aligned to the line-of-sight
due to distance uncertainties in photometric surveys. We model the projection
effects with two simple assumptions and develop a novel method to quantify the
size of the boost using cluster-galaxy cross-correlation functions. We validate
our method using mock cluster catalogs built from cosmological N-body
simulations and find that we can obtain unbiased constraints on the boost
parameter with our model. We then apply our analysis on the SDSS redMaPPer
clusters and find that the size of the boost is roughly 20% for all the
richness bins except the cluster sample with the richness bin $\lambda \in
[30,40]$. This is the first study to constrain the boost parameter independent
from cluster cosmology studies and provides a self-consistency test for the
projection effects.

Title:Modelling Star Cluster Formation: Mergers,"
Abstract:  Star cluster formation in giant molecular clouds involves the local collapse
of the cloud into small gas-rich subclusters, which can then subsequently
collide and merge to build up the final star cluster(s). In this paper, we
simulate collisions between these subclusters, using coupled smooth particle
hydrodynamics for the gas and N-body dynamics for the stars. We are guided by
previous radiation hydrodynamics simulations of molecular cloud collapse which
provide the global properties of the colliding clusters, such as their stellar
and gas masses, and their initial positions and velocities. The subclusters in
the original simulation were treated as sink particles which immediately merged
into a single entity after the collision. We show that the more detailed
treatment provides a more complex picture. At collisional velocities above ~ 10
km/s, the stellar components of the cluster do not form a monolithic cluster
within 3 Myr, although the gas may do so. At lower velocities, the clusters do
eventually merge but over timescales that may be longer than the time for a
subsequent collision. The structure of the resultant cluster is not well-fit by
any standard density distribution, and the clusters are not in equilibrium but
continue to expand over our simulation time. We conclude that the simple sink
particle treatment of subcluster mergers in large-scale giant molecular cloud
simulations provides an upper limit on the final cluster properties.

Title:Photoionized Herbig-Haro objects in the Orion Nebula through deep high-spectral resolution spectroscopy III: HH514,"
Abstract:  We analyze the physical conditions and chemical composition of the
photoionized Herbig-Haro object HH~514, which emerges from the proplyd 170-337
in the core of the Orion Nebula. We use high-spectral resolution spectroscopy
from UVES at the Very Large Telescope and IFU-spectra from MEGARA at the Gran
Telescopio de Canarias. We observe two components of HH~514, the jet base and a
knot, with $n_{\rm e}= (2.3 \pm 0.1) \times 10^5 \text{cm}^{-3}$ and $n_{\rm
e}= (7 \pm 1) \times 10^4 \text{cm}^{-3}$, respectively, both with $T_{\rm
e}\approx 9000 \text{ K}$. We show that the chemical composition of HH~514 is
consistent with that of the Orion Nebula, except for Fe, Ni and S, which show
higher abundances. The enhanced abundances of Fe and Ni observed in HH objects
compared with the general interstellar medium is usually interpreted as
destruction of dust grains. The observed sulphur overabundance (more than two
times solar) is challenging to explain since the proplyd photoevaporation flow
from the same disk shows normal sulphur abundance. If the aforementioned
S-overabundance is due to dust destruction, the formation of sulfides and/or
other S-bearing dust reservoirs may be linked to planet formation processes in
protoplanetary disks, which filter large sulfide dust grains during the
accretion of matter from the disk to the central star. We also show that
published kinematics of molecular emission close to the central star are not
consistent with either a disk perpendicular to the optical jet, nor with an
outflow that is aligned with it.

Title:Halo Assembly Bias using properties of central galaxies in SDSS redMaPPer clusters,"
Abstract:  The clustering of dark matter halos depends on the assembly history of halos
at fixed halo mass; a phenomenon referred to as \textit{halo assembly bias}.
Halo assembly bias is readily observed in cosmological simulations of dark
matter. However, it is difficult to detect it in observations. The
identification of galaxy or cluster properties correlated with the formation
time of the halo at fixed halo mass and the ability to select galaxy clusters
free from projection effects are the two most significant hurdles in the
observational detection of halo assembly bias. The latter, in particular, can
cause a misleading detection of halo assembly bias by boosting the amplitude of
lensing and clustering on large scales. This study uses twelve different
properties of central galaxies of SDSS redMaPPer clusters derived from
spectroscopy to divide the clusters into sub-samples. We test the dependence of
the clustering amplitude on these properties at fixed richness. We first infer
halo mass and bias using weak lensing signals around the clusters using shapes
of galaxies from the SDSS survey. We validate the bias difference between the
two subsamples using cluster-galaxy cross-correlations. This methodology allows
us to decouple the contamination due to the projection effects from the halo
assembly bias signals. We do not find any significant evidence of a difference
in the clustering amplitudes correlated with any of our explored properties.
Our results indicate that central galaxy properties may not correlate
significantly with the halo assembly histories at fixed richness.

Title:Methanol masers in NGC 253 with ALCHEMI,"
Abstract:  Context: Methanol masers of Class I (collisionally-pumped) and Class II
(radiatively-pumped) have been studied in great detail in our Galaxy in a
variety of astrophysical environments such as shocks and star-forming regions
and are helpful to analyze the properties of the dense interstellar medium.
However, the study of methanol masers in external galaxies is still in its
infancy. Aims: Our main goal is to search for methanol masers in the central
molecular zone (CMZ; inner 500 pc) of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253.
Methods: Covering a frequency range between 84 and 373 GHz ($\lambda$ = 3.6 to
0.8 mm) at high angular (1.6""$\sim$27 pc) and spectral ($\sim$8--9 km s$^{-1}$)
resolution with the ALMA large program ALCHEMI, we have probed different
regions across the CMZ of NGC 253. In order to look for methanol maser
candidates, we employed the rotation diagram method and a set of radiative
transfer models. Results: We detect for the first time masers above 84 GHz in
NGC 253, covering an ample portion of the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$
line series (at 84, 132, 229, and 278 GHz) and the $J_{0}\rightarrow(J-$
1)$_{1}-A$ series (at 95, 146, and 198 GHz). This confirms the presence of the
Class I maser line at 84 GHz, already reported but now being detected in more
than one location. For the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ line series, we
observe a lack of Class I maser candidates in the central star-forming disk.
Conclusions: The physical conditions for maser excitation in the
$J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ line series can be weak shocks and
cloud-cloud collisions as suggested by shock tracers (SiO and HNCO) in
bi-symmetric shock/active regions located in the outskirts of the CMZ. On the
other hand, the presence of photodissociation regions due to a high
star-formation rate would be needed to explain the lack of Class I masers in
the very central regions.

Title:Observational Bias and Young Massive Cluster Characterisation I. 2D Perspective Effects,"
Abstract:  Understanding the formation and evolution of high mass star clusters requires
comparisons between theoretical and observational data to be made.
Unfortunately, while the full phase space of simulated regions is available,
often only partial 2D spatial and kinematic data is available for observed
regions. This raises the question as to whether cluster parameters determined
from 2D data alone are reliable and representative of clusters real parameters
and the impact of line-of-sight orientation. In this paper we derive parameters
for a simulated cluster formed from a cloud-cloud collision with the full 6D
phase space, and compare them with those derived from three different 2D
line-of-sight orientations for the cluster. We show the same qualitative
conclusions can be reached when viewing clusters in 2D versus 3D, but that
drawing quantitative conclusions when viewing in 2D is likely to be inaccurate.
The greatest divergence occurs in the perceived kinematics of the cluster,
which in some orientations appears to be expanding when the cluster is actually
contracting. Increases in the cluster density compounds pre-existing
perspective issues, reducing the relative accuracy and consistency of
properties derived from different orientations. This is particularly
problematic for determination of the number, and membership, of subclusters
present in the cluster. We find the fraction of subclusters correctly
identified in 2D decreases as the cluster evolves, reaching less than 3.4% at
the evolutionary end point for our cluster.

Title:Wave-driven outbursts and variability of low-mass supernova progenitors,"
Abstract:  In a substantial number of core-collapse supernovae, early-time interaction
indicates a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that may be produced by outbursts
from the progenitor star. Wave-driven mass loss is a possible mechanism to
produce these signatures, with previous work suggesting this mechanism is most
effective for low mass ($ \sim \! 11 \, M_\odot$) SN progenitors. Using
one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with MESA, we study the effects of
this wave heating in SN progenitors of masses $M_{\rm ZAMS} = 10-13\,
M_{\odot}$. This range encompasses stars that experience semi-degenerate,
central neon burning and more degenerate, off-center neon ignition. We find
that central Ne ignition at $M_{\rm ZAMS} = 11\, M_{\odot}$ produces a burst of
intense wave heating that transmits $\sim10^{47}$ erg of energy at $10$ years
before core collapse, whereas other masses experience smaller levels of wave
heating. Wave heating does not hydrodynamically drive mass loss in any of our
models and is unlikely to produce a very massive CSM on its own. However, wave
heating can cause large radial expansion (by more than an order of magnitude),
photospheric cooling, and luminosity brightening by up to $\sim 10^6\,
L_{\odot}$ in hydrogen-poor stripped star models. Some type Ib/c progenitors
could drastically change their appearance in the final years of their lives,
with brightness in visual bands increasing by nearly 3 mags. Moreover,
interaction with a close binary companion could drive intense mass loss, with
implications for type Ibn and other interaction-powered SNe.

Title:Confirmation of a metallicity spread amongst first population stars in globular clusters,"
Abstract:  Stars in massive star clusters exhibit intrinsic variations in some light
elements (MPs) that are difficult to explain in a coherent formation scenario.
In recent years, HST photometry has led to the characterisation of the global
properties of th MPs in an unparalleled level of detail. In particular, the
colour-colour diagrams known as chromosome maps have been proven to be very
efficient at separating cluster stars with field-like metal abundance
distribution (1P) from object with distinctive light-element abundance
anti-correlations (2P). The unexpected wide colour ranges covered by the 1P
group in the chromosome maps of the majority of the investigated Galactic GCs
have been recently attributed to intrinsic metallicity variations up to ~0.30
dex, from the study of SGB stars in two metal rich Galactic GCs by employing
appropriate HST filter combinations. On the other hand, high-resolution
spectroscopy of small samples of 1P stars in NGC 3201 and NGC 2808 have so far
provided conflicting results, with a spread of metallicity detected in NGC 3201
but not in NGC 2808. We present a new method that employs HST near-UV and
optical photometry of RGB stars, to independently confirm these results. Our
approach has been firstly validated using observational data for M2, a GC
hosting a small group of 1P stars with enhanced (by ~0.5 dex) metallicity with
respect to the main component. We have then applied our method to three
clusters that cover a much larger metallicity range, and have well populated,
extended first population sequences in their chromosome maps, namely M92,
NGC2808, and NGC6362. We confirm that metallicity spreads are present among 1P
stars in these clusters, thus solidifying the case for the existence of
unexpected variations up to a factor of two of metal abundances in most GCs. We

"Title:COCONUT, a novel fast-converging MHD model for solar corona simulations: I. Benchmarking and optimization of polytropic solutions","
Abstract:  We present a novel global 3-D coronal MHD model called COCONUT, polytropic in
its first stage and based on a time-implicit backward Euler scheme. Our model
boosts run-time performance in comparison with contemporary MHD-solvers based
on explicit schemes, which is particularly important when later employed in an
operational setting for space weather forecasting. It is data-driven in the
sense that we use synoptic maps as inner boundary input for our potential field
initialization as well as an inner boundary condition in the further MHD time
evolution. The coronal model is developed as part of the EUropean Heliospheric
FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) and will replace the currently
employed, more simplistic, empirical Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model. At 21.5 Rs
where the solar wind is already supersonic, it is coupled to EUHFORIA's
heliospheric model. We validate and benchmark our coronal simulation results
with the explicit-scheme Wind-Predict model and find good agreement for
idealized limit cases as well as real magnetograms, while obtaining a
computational time reduction of up to a factor 3 for simple idealized cases,
and up to 35 for realistic configurations, and we demonstrate that the time
gained increases with the spatial resolution of the input synoptic map. We also
use observations to constrain the model and show that it recovers relevant
features such as the position and shape of the streamers (by comparison with
eclipse white-light images), the coronal holes (by comparison with EUV images)
and the current sheet (by comparison with WSA model at 0.1 AU).

Title:Online triggers for supernova and pre-supernova neutrino detection with cryogenic detectors,"
Abstract:  Supernovae (SNe) are among the most energetic events in the universe still
far from being fully understood. An early and prompt detection of neutrinos is
a one-time opportunity for the realization of the first multi-messenger
observation of these events. In this work, we present the prospects of
detecting neutrinos produced before (pre-SN) and during a SN while running an
advanced cryogenic detector. The recent advancements of the cryogenic detector
technique and the discovery of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
offer a wealth of opportunities in neutrino detection. The combination of the
excellent energy resolution of this experimental technique, with the high cross
section of this detection channel and its equal sensitivity to all neutrino
flavors enables the realization of highly sensitive cm-scale neutrino
telescopes, as the newly proposed RES-NOVA experiment. We present a detailed
study on the detection promptness of pre-SN and SN neutrino signals, with
direct comparisons among different classes of test statistics. While the
well-established Poisson test offers in general best performance under optimal
conditions, the non-parametric Recursive Product of Spacing statistical test
(RPS) is more robust and ideal for triggering astrophysical neutrino signals
with no specific prior knowledge. Based on our statistical tests the RES-NOVA
experiment is able to identify SN neutrino signals at a 15 kpc distance with
95% of success rate, and pre-SN signal as far as 480 pc with a pre-warn time of
the order of 10 s. These results demonstrate the potential of RPS for the
identification of neutrino signals and the physics reach of the RES-NOVA
experiment.

Title:Got plenty of nothing: cosmic voids as a probe of particle dark matter,"
Abstract:  The search for a particle dark matter signal in terms of radiation produced
by dark matter annihilation or decay has to cope with the extreme faintness of
the predicted signal and the presence of masking astrophysical backgrounds. It
has been shown that using the correlated information between the dark matter
distribution in the Universe with the fluctuations of the cosmic radiation
fields has the potential to allow setting apart a pure dark matter signal from
astrophysical emissions, since spatial fluctuations in the radiation field due
to astrophysical sources and dark matter emission have different features. The
cross-correlation technique has been proposed and adopted for dark matter
studies by looking at dark matter halos (over-densities). In this paper we
extend the technique by focusing on the information on dark matter distribution
offered by cosmic voids, and by looking specifically at the gamma-ray dark
matter emission: we show that, while being under-dense and therefore producing
a reduced emission as compared to halos, nevertheless in voids the relative
size of the cross-correlation signal due to decaying dark matter vs.
astrophysical sources is significantly more favourable, producing
signal-to-background ratios $S/B$ (even significantly) larger than 1 for decay
lifetimes up to $2 \times 10^{30}$ s. This is at variance with the case of
halos, where $S/B$ is typically (even much) smaller than 1. We show that
forthcoming galaxy surveys such as Euclid combined with future generation
gamma-ray detectors with improved specifications have the ability to provide a
hint of such a signal with a predicted significance up to $4.2\sigma$ for
galaxies and $2.7\sigma$ for the cosmic shear. The bound on the dark matter
lifetime attainable exploiting voids is predicted to improve on current bounds
in a mass range for the WIMP of $20\div200$ GeV.

Title:A Genetic Algorithm to model Solar Radio Active Regions from 3D Magnetic Field Extrapolations,"
Abstract:  In recent decades our understanding of solar active regions (ARs) has
improved substantially due to observations made with better angular resolution
and wider spectral coverage. While prior AR observations have shown that these
structures were always brighter than the quiet Sun at centimeter wavelengths,
recent observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths have shown ARs
with well defined dark umbrae. Given this new information, it is now necessary
to update our understanding and models of the solar atmosphere in active
regions. In this work, we present a data-constrained model of the AR solar
atmosphere, in which we use brightness temperature measurements of NOAA 12470
at three radio frequencies: 17 (NoRH), 100 and 230 GHz (ALMA). Based on our
model, which assumes that the radio emission originates from thermal free-free
and gyroresonance processes, we calculate radio brightness temperature maps
that can be compared with the observations. The magnetic field at distinct
atmospheric heights was determined in our modelling process by force-free field
extrapolation using photospheric magnetograms taken by HMI/SDO. In order to
determine the best plasma temperature and density height profiles necessary to
match the observations, the model uses a genetic algorithm that modifies a
standard quiet Sun atmospheric model. Our results show that the height of the
transition region (TR) of the modelled atmosphere varies with the type of
region being modelled: for umbrae the TR is located at 1080 +/- 20 km above the
solar surface; for penumbrae, the TR is located at 1800 +/- 50 km; and for
bright regions outside sunspots, the TR is located at 2000 +/- 100 km. With
these results, we find good agreement with the observed AR brightness
temperature maps. Our modelled AR can be used to estimate the emission at
frequencies without observational coverage.

Title:Gravothermal evolution of dark matter halos with differential elastic scattering,"
Abstract:  We study gravothermal evolution of dark matter halos in the presence of
differential self-scattering that has strong velocity and angular dependencies.
We design controlled N-body simulations to model Rutherford and Moller
scatterings in the halo, and follow its evolution in both core-expansion and
-collapse phases. The simulations show the commonly-used transfer cross section
underestimates the effects of dark matter self-interactions, but the viscosity
cross section provides an accurate approximation for modeling angular-dependent
dark matter scattering. We investigate thermodynamic properties of the halo,
and find that the three moments of the Boltzmann equation under the fluid
approximation are satisfied. We further propose a constant effective cross
section, which integrates over the halo's characteristic velocity dispersion
with weighting kernels motivated by kinetic theory of heat conduction. The
effective cross section provides a good approximation to differential
self-scattering for most of the halo evolution. It indicates that we can map
astrophysical constraints on a constant self-interacting cross section to an
SIDM model with velocity- and angular-dependent scatterings.

Title:Climbing out of the shadows: building the distance ladder with black hole images,"
Abstract:  In the era of precision cosmology it has became crucial to find new and
competitive probes to estimate cosmological parameters, in an effort of finding
answers to the current cosmological tensions/discrepancies. In this work, we
show the possibility of using observations of Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH)
shadows as an anchor for the distance ladder, substituting the sources usually
exploited for such purpose, such as Cepheid variable stars. Compared to the
standard approaches, the use of SMBH has the advantage of not needing to be
anchored with distance calibrators outside the Hubble flow since the shadows
physical size can be estimated knowing the mass of the SMBH. Furthermore, SMBH
are supposed to inhabit the center of all galaxies which, in principle, means
that we can measure the size of the shadows in any Supernova type Ia host
galaxy. Under the assumption that the mass of the SMBH can be accurately and
reliably estimated, we find that the Hubble constant can be constrained with a
$\approx10\%$ precision even considering current experimental design of
ground-based interferometers. By constructing a SMBH catalogue based on a
specific choice of the SMBH Mass Function (BHMF), we forecast the constraints
on the Hubble constant, finding that a precision of $\approx4\%$ may be within
reach of future interferometers.

Title:The impact of very massive stars on the chemical evolution of extremely metal-poor galaxies,"
Abstract:  In recent observations of extremely metal-poor low-mass starburst galaxies,
almost solar Fe/O ratios are reported, despite N/O ratios consistent with the
low metallicity. We investigate if the peculiar Fe/O ratios can be a
distinctive signature of an early enrichment produced by very massive objects
dying as Pair-Instability Supernovae (PISN). We run chemical evolution models
with yields that account for the contribution by PISN. We use both the recent
non-rotating stellar yields from Goswami et al. 2021, and new yields from
rotating very massive stars calculated on purpose in this work. We also search
for the best initial mass function (IMF) that is able to reproduce the
observations. We can reproduce the observations by adopting a bi-modal IMF and
by including an initial burst of rotating very massive stars. Only with a burst
of very massive stars can we reproduce the almost solar Fe/O ratios at the
estimated young ages. We also confirm that rotation is absolutely needed to
concomitantly reproduce the observed N/O ratios. These results stress the
importance of very massive stars in galactic chemical evolution studies and
strongly support a top-heavy initial mass function in the very early
evolutionary stages of metal poor starburst galaxies.

Title:Multi-messenger High-Energy Signatures of Decaying Dark Matter and the Effect of Background Light,"
Abstract:  The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole has measured astrophysical
neutrinos using through-going and starting events in the TeV to PeV energy
range. The origin of these astrophysical neutrinos is still largely unresolved,
and among their potential sources could be dark matter decay. Measurements of
the astrophysical flux using muon neutrinos are in slight tension with starting
event measurements. This tension is driven by an excess observed in the energy
range of 40-200 TeV with respect to the through-going expectation. Previous
works have considered the possibility that this excess may be due to heavy dark
matter decay and have placed constraints using gamma-ray and neutrino data.
However, these constraints are not without caveats since they rely on the
modeling of the astrophysical neutrino flux and the sources of gamma-ray
emission. In this work, we derive background-agnostic galactic and
extragalactic constraints on decaying dark matter by considering Tibet
AS$_\gamma$ data, Fermi-LAT diffuse data, and the IceCube high-energy starting
event sample. For the gamma-ray limits, we investigate the uncertainties on
secondary emission from electromagnetic cascades during propagation arising
from the unknown intensity of the extragalactic background light. We find that
such uncertainties amount to a variation of up to $\sim 55\%$ in the gamma-ray
limits derived with extragalactic data. Our results imply that a significant
fraction of the astrophysical neutrino flux could be due to dark matter and
that ruling it out depends on the assumptions on the gamma-ray and neutrino
background. The latter depends on the yet unidentified sources.

Title:The First Short GRB Millimeter Afterglow: The Wide-Angled Jet of the Extremely Energetic SGRB 211106A,"
Abstract:  We present the discovery of the first millimeter afterglow of a
short-duration $\gamma$-ray burst (SGRB) and the first confirmed afterglow of
an SGRB localized by the GUANO system on Swift. Our Atacama Large
Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) detection of SGRB 211106A establishes an
origin in a faint host galaxy detected in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging
at $0.7\lesssim z\lesssim1.4$. From the lack of a detectable optical afterglow,
coupled with the bright millimeter counterpart, we infer a high extinction,
$A_{\rm V}\gtrsim2.6$ mag along the line of sight, making this the one of the
most highly dust-extincted SGRBs known to date. The millimeter-band light curve
captures the passage of the synchrotron peak from the afterglow forward shock
and reveals a jet break at $t_{\rm jet}=29.2^{+4.5}_{-4.0}$~days. For a
presumed redshift of $z=1$, we infer an opening angle, $\theta_{\rm
jet}=(15.5\pm1.4)$~degrees, and beaming-corrected kinetic energy of
$\log(E_{\rm K}/{\rm erg})=51.8\pm0.3$, making this one of the widest and most
energetic SGRB jets known to date. Combining all published millimeter-band
upper limits in conjunction with the energetics for a large sample of SGRBs, we
find that energetic outflows in high density environments are more likely to
have detectable millimeter counterparts. Concerted afterglow searches with ALMA
should yield detection fractions of 24-40% on timescales of $\gtrsim2$~days at
rates $\approx0.8$-1.6 per year, outpacing the historical discovery rate of
SGRB centimeter-band afterglows.

Title:A dynamics-based density profile for dark haloes -- II. Fitting function,"
Abstract:  The density profiles of dark matter haloes are commonly described by fitting
functions such as the NFW or Einasto models, but these approximations break
down in the transition region where halos become dominated by newly accreting
matter. In Paper I we dynamically split simulation particles into orbiting and
infalling components and analysed their separate profiles. Here we propose
simple, accurate fitting functions designed to capture the asymptotic shapes of
the two terms at large and small radii. The orbiting term is described as a
truncated Einasto profile, $\rho_{\rm orb} \propto \exp \left[-2/\alpha\ (r /
r_{\rm s})^\alpha - 1/\beta\ (r / r_{\rm t})^\beta \right]$, with a
five-parameter space of normalization, physically distinct scale and truncation
radii, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which control how rapidly the profiles
steepen. The infalling profile is modelled as a power law in overdensity that
smoothly transitions to a constant at the halo centre. We show that these
formulae fit the averaged, total profiles in simulations to about 5% accuracy
across almost all of an expansive parameter space in halo mass, redshift,
cosmology, and accretion rate. When fixing $\alpha = 0.18$ and $\beta = 3$, the
formula becomes a three-parameter model for the orbiting term that fits
individual halos better than the Einasto profile on average.

Title:Primordial trispectrum from kSZ tomography,"
Abstract:  The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect is a secondary CMB temperature
anisotropy that provides a powerful probe of the radial-velocity field of
matter distributed across the Universe. This velocity field is reconstructed by
combining high-resolution CMB measurements with galaxy survey data, and it
provides an unbiased tracer of matter perturbations in the linear regime. In
this paper, we show how this measurement can be used to probe primordial
non-Gaussianity of the local type, particularly focusing on the trispectrum
amplitude $\tau_{\rm NL}$, as may arise in a simple two-field inflation model
that we provide by way of illustration. Cross-correlating the
velocity-field-derived matter distribution with the biased large-scale galaxy
density field allows one to measure the scale-dependent bias factor with sample
variance cancellation. We forecast that a configuration corresponding to CMB-S4
and VRO results in a sensitivity of $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \approx 0.59$ and
$\sigma_{\tau_{\rm NL}} \approx 1.5$. These forecasts predict improvement
factors of 10 and 195 for $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}$ and $\sigma_{\tau_{\rm NL}}$,
respectively, over the sensitivity using VRO data alone, without internal
sample variance cancellation. Similarly, for a configuration corresponding to
DESI and SO, we forecast a sensitivity of $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \approx 3.1$ and
$\sigma_{\tau_{\rm NL}} \approx 69$, with improvement factors of 2 and 5,
respectively, over the use of the DESI data-set in isolation. We find that a
high galaxy number density and large survey volume considerably improve our
ability to probe the amplitude of the primordial trispectrum for the
multi-field model considered.

Title:The R-Process Alliance: A Nearly Complete R-Process Abundance Template Derived from Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of the R-Process-Enhanced Metal-Poor Star HD 222925,"
Abstract:  We present a nearly complete rapid neutron-capture process (r-process)
chemical inventory of the metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -1.46 +/- 0.10)
r-process-enhanced ([Eu/Fe] = +1.32 +/- 0.08) halo star HD 222925. This
abundance set is the most complete for any object beyond the solar system,
totaling 63 metals detected and 7 with upper limits. It comprises 42 elements
from 31 <= Z <= 90, including elements rarely detected in r-process-enhanced
stars, such as Ga, Ge, As, Se, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au.
We derive these abundances from an analysis of 404 absorption lines in
ultraviolet spectra collected using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on
the Hubble Space Telescope and previously analyzed optical spectra. A series of
appendices discusses the atomic data and quality of fits for these lines. The
r-process elements from Ba to Pb, including all elements at the third r-process
peak, exhibit remarkable agreement with the Solar r-process residuals, with a
standard deviation of the differences of only 0.08 dex (17%). In contrast,
deviations among the lighter elements from Ga to Te span nearly 1.4 dex, and
they show distinct trends from Ga to Se, Nb through Cd, and In through Te. The
r-process contribution to Ga, Ge, and As is small, and Se is the lightest
element whose production is dominated by the r-process. The lanthanide
fraction, log(X_La) = -1.39 +/- 0.09, is typical for r-process-enhanced stars
and higher than that of the kilonova from the GW170817 neutron-star merger
event. We advocate adopting this pattern as an alternative to the Solar
r-process-element residuals when confronting future theoretical models of
heavy-element nucleosynthesis with observations.

Title:Bayesian Characterisation of Circumbinary Exoplanets with LISA,"
Abstract:  The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect and characterize
$\sim10^4$ Galactic Binaries consisting predominantly of two White Dwarfs (WD).
An interesting prospect within this population is a third object--another WD
star, a Circumbinary Exoplanet (CBP), or a Brown Dwarf (BD)--in orbit about the
inner WD pair. We present the first fully Bayesian detection and posterior
analysis of sub-stellar objects with LISA, focusing on the characterization of
CBPs. We used an optimistic astrophysically motivated catalogue of these CBP
third-body sources, including their orbital eccentricity around the inner
binary for the first time. We examined Bayesian Evidence computations for
detectability, as well as the effects on the posterior distributions for both
the inner binary parameters and the third-body parameters. We find that the
posterior behavior bifurcates based on whether the third-body period is above
or below half the observation time. Additionally, we find that undetectable
third-body sources can bias the inner binary parameters whether or not the
correct template is used. We used the information retrieved from the study of
the CBP population to make an initial conservative prediction for the number of
detectable BD systems in the original catalogue. We end with commentary on the
predicted qualitative effects on LISA global fitting and Galactic Binary
population analysis. The procedure used in this work is generic and can be
directly applied to other astrophysical effects expected within the Galactic
Binary population.

Title:Millisecond Pulsar Kicks Cause Difficulties in Explaining the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess,"
Abstract:  The unexplained excess gamma-ray emission from the Milky Way's Galactic
Center has puzzled astronomers for nearly a decade. Two theories strive to
explain the origin of this excess: self-annihilating dark matter particles or
an unresolved population of radio millisecond pulsars. We examine the
plausibility of a pulsar origin for the GeV excess using N-body simulations. We
simulated millisecond pulsars in a realistic dynamical environment: (i) pulsars
were born from the known stellar mass components of our Galaxy; (ii) pulsars
were given natal velocity kicks as empirically observed from two different
studies (or, for comparison, without kicks); (iii) pulsars were evolved in a
Galactic gravitational potential consistent with observations. Multiple
populations of pulsars (with different velocity kicks) were simulated over 1
Gyr. With final spatial distributions of pulsars, we constructed synthetic
gamma-ray surface brightness profiles. From comparisons with published
Fermi-LAT surface brightness profiles, our pulsar simulations cannot reproduce
the concentrated emission in the central degrees of the Bulge, though models
without natal velocity kicks approach the data. We considered additive
combinations of our (primordial MSP) simulations with models where pulsars are
deposited from destroyed globular clusters in the Bulge, and a simple model for
pulsars produced in the nuclear star cluster. We can reasonably reproduce the
measured central gamma-ray surface brightness distribution of Horiuchi and
collaborators using several combinations of these models, but we cannot
reproduce the measured distribution of Di Mauro with any combination of models.
Our fits provide constraints on potential pathways to explain the gamma-ray
excess using MSPs.

Title:Asteroseismology of evolved stars to constrain the internal transport of angular momentum. V. Efficiency of the transport on the red giant branch and in the red clump,"
Abstract:  Thanks to asteroseismology, constraints on the core rotation rate are
available for hundreds of low- and intermediate-mass stars in evolved phases.
Current physical processes tested in stellar evolution models cannot reproduce
the evolution of these core rotation rates. We investigate the efficiency of
the internal angular momentum redistribution in red giants during the hydrogen
shell and core-helium burning phases based on the asteroseismic determinations
of their core rotation rates. We compute stellar evolution models with rotation
and model the transport of angular momentum by the action of a sole dominant
diffusive process parametrized by an additional viscosity. We constrain the
values of this viscosity to match the mean core rotation rates of red giants
and their behaviour with mass and evolution along the red giant branch and in
the red clump. For red giants in the hydrogen shell-burning phase the transport
of angular momentum must be more efficient in more massive stars. The
additional viscosity is found to vary by approximately two orders of magnitude
in the mass range M $\sim$ 1 - 2.5 M$_{\odot}$. As stars evolve along the red
giant branch, the efficiency of the internal transport of angular momentum must
increase for low-mass stars (M $\lesssim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$) and remain
approximately constant for slightly higher masses (2.0 M$_{\odot}$ $\lesssim$ M
$\lesssim$ 2.5 M$_{\odot}$). In red-clump stars, the additional viscosities
must be an order of magnitude higher than in younger red giants of similar mass
during the hydrogen shell-burning phase. In combination with previous efforts,
we obtain a clear picture of how the physical processes acting in stellar
interiors should redistribute angular momentum from the end of the main
sequence until the core-helium burning phase for low- and intermediate-mass
stars to satisfy the asteroseismic constraints.

Title:The mercurial Sun at the heart of our solar system,"
Abstract:  As the powerhouse of our solar system, the Sun's electromagnetic planetary
influences appear contradictory. On the one hand, the Sun for aeons emitted
radiation which was ""just right"" for life to evolve in our terrestrial
Goldilocks zone, even for such complex organisms as ourselves. On the other, in
the dawn of Earth's existence the Sun was far dimmer than today, and yet
evidence for early liquid water is written into geology. Now in middle age, the
Sun should be a benign object of little interest to society or even
astronomers. However, for physical reasons yet to be fully understood, it
contains a magnetic machine with a slightly arrhythmic 11 year magnetic
heartbeat. Although these variations require merely
0.1% of the solar luminosity, this power floods the solar system with rapidly
changing fluxes of photons and particles at energies far above the 0.5eV
thermal energy characteristic of the photosphere. Ejected solar plasma carries
magnetic fields into space with consequences for planets, the Earth being
vulnerable to geomagnetic storms.
This chapter discusses some physical reasons why the Sun suffers from such
ailments, and examine consequences through time across the solar system. A
Leitmotiv of the discussion is that any rotating and convecting star must
inevitably generate magnetic ""activity"" for which the Sun represents the
example par excellence.

that there is a possible correlation between the optical and the X-ray flux
variabilities of the ULX-8. The possible scenarios which are frequently

Title:Implications for additional plasma heating driving the extreme-ultraviolet late phase of a solar flare with microwave imaging spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  Extreme-ultraviolet late phase (ELP) refers to the second extreme-ultraviolet
(EUV) radiation enhancement observed in certain solar flares, which usually
occurs tens of minutes to several hours after the peak of soft X-ray emission.
The coronal loop system that hosts the ELP emission is often different from the
main flaring arcade, and the enhanced EUV emission therein may imply an
additional heating process. However, the origin of the ELP remains rather
unclear. Here we present the analysis of a C1.4 flare that features such an
ELP, which is also observed in microwave wavelengths by the Expanded Owens
Valley Solar Array (EOVSA). Similar to the case of the ELP, we find a gradual
microwave enhancement that occurs about three minutes after the main impulsive
phase microwave peaks. Radio sources coincide with both footpoints of the ELP
loops and spectral fits on the time-varying microwave spectra demonstrate a
clear deviation of the electron distribution from the Maxwellian case, which
could result from injected nonthermal electrons or nonuniform heating to the
footpoint plasma. We further point out that the delayed microwave enhancement
suggests the presence of an additional heating process, which could be
responsible for the evaporation of heated plasma that fills the ELP loops,
producing the prolonged ELP emission.

challenge when facing the large amount of data from different instruments. For
the automatic detection of ICMEs we propose a pipeline using a method that has
recently proven successful in medical image segmentation. Comparing it to an
existing method, we find that while achieving similar results, our model
outperforms the baseline regarding training time by a factor of approximately
20, thus making it more applicable for other datasets. The method has been
tested on in situ data from the Wind spacecraft between 1997 and 2015 with a
True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.64. Out of the 640 ICMEs, 466 were detected
correctly by our algorithm, producing a total of 254 False Positives.
Additionally, it produced reasonable results on datasets with fewer features
and smaller training sets from Wind, STEREO-A and STEREO-B with True Skill
Statistics of 0.56, 0.57 and 0.53, respectively. Our pipeline manages to find
the start of an ICME with a mean absolute error (MAE) of around 2 hours and 56
minutes, and the end time with a MAE of 3 hours and 20 minutes. The relatively
fast training allows straightforward tuning of hyperparameters and could
therefore easily be used to detect other structures and phenomena in solar wind
data, such as corotating interaction regions.

Title:Detection of a quasi-periodic oscillation in the optical light curve of the remarkable blazar AO 0235+164,"
Abstract:  We present a long term optical $R$ band light curve analysis of the
gravitationally lensed blazar AO 0235+164 in the time span 1982 - 2019. Several
methods of analysis lead to the result that there is a periodicity of ~8.13
years present in these data. In addition, each of these five major flares are
apparently double-peaked, with the secondary peak following the primary one by
~2 years. Along with the well known system, OJ 287, our finding constitutes one
of the most secure cases of long term quasi-periodic optical behaviour in a
blazar ever found. A binary supermassive black hole system appears to provide a
good explanation for these results.

Title:Double cascade reconstruction in KM3NeT/ARCA,"
Abstract:  The detection of astrophysical $\nu_\tau$ is an important verification of the
observed flux of high-energy neutrinos. A flavour ratio of approximately
$\nu_{e} : \nu_\mu : \nu_\tau \approx 1 : 1 : 1$ is predicted for astrophysical
neutrinos measured at Earth due to neutrino oscillations. On top of this, the
$\nu_\tau$ offers a unique channel for neutrino astronomy due to absence of an
atmospheric $\nu_\tau$ background contribution. When a $\nu_\tau$ interacts it
produces a particle cascade and often a $\tau$ lepton which in turn decays
mainly into another cascade. This results in a double cascade signature. An
excellent angular resolution can be achieved when both cascade vertices are
reconstructed. The KM3NeT/ARCA detector, which is under construction in the
Mediterranean sea, will be able to detect this signature due to its timing and
spatial resolution for cascades. We will discuss the dedicated reconstruction
algorithm and performance for reconstructing double cascades using KM3NeT. The
angular deviation reaches sub-degree level for tau lengths larger than 25
meters.

Title:Long Term Multi-band Near Infra-Red Variability of the Blazar OJ 287 during 2007--2021,"
Abstract:  We present the most extensive and well-sampled long-term multi-band
near-infrared (NIR) temporal and spectral variability study of OJ 287,
considered to be the best candidate binary supermassive black hole blazar.
These observations were made between December 2007 and November 2021. The
source underwent ~ 2 -- 2.5 magnitude variations in the J, H, and Ks NIR bands.
Over these long-term timescales there were no systematic trends in either flux
or spectral evolution with time or with the source's flux states. However, on
shorter timescales, there are significant variations in flux and spectra
indicative of strong changes during different activity states. The NIR spectral
energy distributions show diverse facets at each flux state, from the lowest to
the highest. The spectra are, in general, consistent with a power-law spectral
profile (within 10%) and many of them indicate minor changes (observationally
insignificant) in the shift of the peak. The NIR spectra generally steepens
during bright phases. We briefly discuss these behaviors in the context of
blazar emission scenarios/mechanisms, OJ 287's well-known traditional behavior,
and implications for models of the source central engine invoked for its
long-term optical semi-periodic variations.

Title:Performance of the polarization leakage correction in the PILOT data,"
Abstract:  The Polarized Instrument for Long-wavelength Observation of the Tenuous
interstellar medium (PILOT) is a balloon-borne experiment that aims to measure
the polarized emission of thermal dust at a wavelength of 240 um (1.2 THz). The
PILOT experiment flew from Timmins, Ontario, Canada in 2015 and 2019 and from
Alice Springs, Australia in April 2017. The in-flight performance of the
instrument during the second flight was described in Mangilli et al. 2019. In
this paper, we present data processing steps that were not presented in
Mangilli et al. 2019 and that we have recently implemented to correct for
several remaining instrumental effects. The additional data processing concerns
corrections related to detector cross-talk and readout circuit memory effects,
and leakage from total intensity to polarization. We illustrate the above
effects and the performance of our corrections using data obtained during the
third flight of PILOT, but the methods used to assess the impact of these
effects on the final science-ready data, and our strategies for correcting them
will be applied to all PILOT data. We show that the above corrections, and in
particular that for the intensity to polarization leakage, which is most
critical for accurate polarization measurements with PILOT, are accurate to
better than 0.4 % as measured on Jupiter during flight#3.

Title:Three-dimensional weak gravitational lensing of the 21-cm radiation background,"
Abstract:  We study weak gravitational lensing by the cosmic large-scale structure of
the 21-cm radiation background in the 3d-weak lensing formalism. The interplay
between source distance measured at finite resolution, visibility and lensing
terms is analysed in detail and the resulting total covariance $C_{\ell}(k,k')$
is derived. The effect of lensing correlates different multipoles through
convolution, breaking the statistical homogeneity of the 21-cm radiation
background. This homogeneity breaking can be exploited to reconstruct the
lensing field $\hat{\phi}_{\ell m}(\kappa)$ and noise lensing reconstruction
$N_{\ell}^{\hat{\phi}}$ by means of quadratic estimators. The effects related
to the actual measurement process (redshift precision and visibility terms)
change drastically the values of the off-diagonal terms of the total covariance
$C_{\ell}(k,k')$. It is expected that the detection of lensing effects on a
21-cm radiation background will require sensitive studies and high-resolution
observations by future low-frequency radio arrays such as the SKA survey.

Title:Possible Solution to the Triple Alpha Fine-Tuning Problem: Spallation Reactions during Planet Formation,"
Abstract:  Carbon is produced during the helium burning phase of sufficiently massive
stars through the triple alpha process. The $0^+$ energy level of the carbon
nucleus allows for resonant nuclear reactions, which act to greatly increase
the carbon yields compared to the non-resonant case. Many authors have argued
that small changes to the energy level of this resonance would lead to a
significantly lower carbon abundance in the universe, and this sensitivity is
often considered an example of fine-tuning. By considering spallation reactions
occuring during the process of planet formation, this paper presents a partial
solution to this triple alpha fine-tuning problem. Young stellar objects
generate substantial luminosities of particle radiation (cosmic rays) that can
drive nuclear reactions through spallation. If the standard triple alpha
process is inoperative, stars tend to synthesize oxygen (and other alpha
elements) rather than carbon. Cosmic rays can interact with oxygen nuclei to
produce carbon while planets are forming. The resulting carbon abundances are
significant, but much smaller than those observed in our universe. However, for
a range of conditions -- as delineated herein -- spallation reactions can
result in carbon-to-oxygen ratios roughly comparable to those found on Earth
and thereby obviate the triple alpha fine-tuning problem.

Title:The TeV Diffuse Cosmic Neutrino Spectrum and the Nature of Astrophysical Neutrino Sources,"
Abstract:  The diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos has been measured by the IceCube
Observatory from TeV to PeV energies. We show that an improved characterization
of this flux at the lower energies, TeV and sub-TeV, reveals important
information on the nature of the astrophysical neutrino sources in a
model-independent way. Most significantly, it could confirm the present
indications that neutrinos originate in cosmic environments that are optically
thick to GeV-TeV $\gamma$-rays. This conclusion will become inevitable if a
steeper or even uninterrupted neutrino power law is observed in the TeV region.
In such $\gamma$-ray-obscured sources, the $\gamma$-rays that inevitably
accompany cosmic neutrinos will cascade down to MeV-GeV energies. The
requirement that the cascaded $\gamma$-ray flux accompanying cosmic neutrinos
should not exceed the observed diffuse $\gamma$-ray background, puts
constraints on the peak energy and density of the radiation fields in the
sources. Our calculations inspired by the existing data suggest that a fraction
of the observed diffuse MeV-GeV $\gamma$-ray background may be contributed by
neutrino sources with intense radiation fields that obscure the high-energy
$\gamma$-ray emission accompanying the neutrinos.

Title:The first molecules in the intergalactic medium and halos of the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn,"
Abstract:  We study the formation and destruction of the first molecules at the epochs
of the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn to evaluate the luminosity of the protogalaxy
clumps (halos) in the molecular lines. The cosmological recombination is
described using the model of an effective three-level atom, while the chemistry
of the molecules is examined using the relevant basic kinetic equations. We
then studied the effect of collisional and radiative excitation of molecules on
the intensity of molecular emission in both warm and hot halos. Using the
Planck data on the reionization of the intergalactic medium at z~6-8, we
evaluated the upper limits of the light energy density for four models of
thermal light from the first sources that appeared in the Cosmic Dawn epoch.
Assuming that in the halos, the light energy density may essentially be even
higher, we estimated the impact of the light from the first sources on the
formation and destruction of the first molecules. We show that the molecules H2
and HD are destroyed by photodissociation processes shortly before the full
reionization in the inter-halo medium, in the medium of both types of halos and
for all models of the first light. At the same time, the number density of
helium hydride ions, HeH+, shows essentially more complicated dependences on
the kinetic temperature of halos and the models of the first light.
Furthermore, we estimated the differential brightness temperature of the
individual halo in the rotational lines of H2, HD and HeH+ molecules at
redshifts corresponding to the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs. It does not
exceed the microkelvin, but its detection may be an important source of
information about the physical processes taking place at the beginning of the
formation of the first stars and galaxies at the epochs of the Dark Ages and
Cosmic Dawn.

Title:Nonparametric Representation of Neutron Star Equation of State Using Variational Auto-Encoder,"
Abstract:  We introduce a new nonparametric representation of the neutron star (NS)
equation of state (EoS) by using the variational auto-encoder (VAE). As a deep
neural network, the VAE is widely used for dimensionality reduction since it
can compress input data to a low dimensional latent space using the encoder
component and then reconstruct the data using the decoder component. Once a VAE
is trained one can take the decoder of the VAE as a generator. We employ
100,000 EoSs generated with the nonparametric representation method in
\citet{2021ApJ...919...11H} as the training set and try different settings of
the neural network, then get an EoS generator (trained VAE's decoder) with 4
parameters. We use the mass\textendash{}tidal-deformability data of binary
neutron star (BNS) merger event GW170817, and the mass\textendash{}radius data
of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740-6620, PSR J0437-4715, and 4U 1702-429 to perform
the joint Bayesian inference. We find out that
$R_{1.4}=12.66^{+0.71}_{-0.54}\,\rm km$, $\Lambda_{1.4}=484^{+118}_{-90}$, and
$M_{\rm max}=2.30^{+0.30}_{-0.21}\,\rm M_\odot$ ($90\%$ credible levels), where
$R_{1.4}$/$\Lambda_{1.4}$ are the radius/tidal-deformability of a canonical

a tracer for large scale electron density and help improve the measurement of

galaxy number counts within 1' around the given localized FRB source can help
improve the cosmological parameter constraints by more than 20%.

Title:Gravitational Wave Signal for Quark Matter with Realistic Phase Transition,"
Abstract:  The cores of neutron stars (NSs) near the maximum mass realize the most
highly compressed matter in the universe where quark degrees of freedom may be
liberated. Such a state of dense matter is hypothesized as quark matter (QM)
and its presence has awaited to be confirmed for decades in nuclear physics.
Gravitational waves from binary NS mergers are expected to convey useful
information called the equation of state (EOS). However, the signature for QM
with realistic EOS is not yet established. Here, we show that the gravitational
wave in the post-merger stage can distinguish the theory scenarios with and
without a transition to QM. Instead of adopting specific EOSs as studied
previously, we compile reliable EOS constraints from the ab initio approaches.
We demonstrate that early collapse to a black hole after NS merger signifies
softening of the EOS associated with the onset of QM in accord with ab initio
constraints. Nature of hadron-quark phase transition can be further constrained
by the condition that electromagnetic counterparts need to be energized by the
material left outside the remnant black hole.

Title:R-process Rain from Binary Neutron Star Mergers in the Galactic Halo,"
Abstract:  Compact binary mergers involving at least one neutron star are promising
sites for the synthesis of $\textit{r}$-process elements found in stars and
planets. However, mergers can take place at significant offsets from their host
galaxies, with many occurring several kpc from star-forming regions. It is thus
important to understand the physical mechanisms involved in transporting
enriched material from merger sites in the galactic halo to the star-forming
disk. We investigate these processes, starting from an explosive injection
event and its interaction with the halo medium. We show that the total outflow
mass in compact binary mergers is too low for the material to travel to the
disk in a ballistic fashion. Instead, the enriched ejecta is swept into a
shell, which decelerates over $\lesssim 10$ pc scales and becomes corrugated by
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The corrugated shell is denser than the
ambient medium, and breaks into clouds which sink toward the disk. These
sinking clouds lose thermal energy through radiative cooling, and are also
ablated by shearing instabilities. We present a dynamical heuristic that models
these effects to predict the delay times for delivery to the disk. However, we
find that turbulent mass ablation is extremely efficient, and leads to the
total fragmentation of sinking $\textit{r}$-process clouds over $10-100$ pc
scales. We thus predict that enriched material from halo injection events
quickly assimilates into the gas medium of the halo, and that enriched mass
flow to the disk could only be accomplished through turbulent diffusion or
large-scale inflowing mass currents.

Title:Multiply eclipsing candidates from the TESS satellite,"
Abstract:  We present the catalogue of the TESS targets showing multiple eclipses. It
means that in all of these stars we detected two sets of eclipses, for which
their two distinctive periods can be derived. These multiple stellar systems
can be either doubly eclipsing quadruples, or triple-star coplanar systems
showing besides the inner eclipses also the eclipses on the outer orbit. In
total, 116 systems were found as doubly eclipsing, while 25 stars were
identified as triply eclipsing triples. Several confirmed blends of two close
sources were not included into our analysis. All these systems were identified
scanning the known eclipsing systems taken from VSX database checking their
TESS light curves. The average period of the dominant pair A is 2.7 days in our
sample, while for the second pair B the average period is 5.3 days. Several
systems show evident ETV changes even from the short interval of the TESS data,
indicating possible period changes and short mutual orbit. We also present an
evidence that the system V0871 Cen is probably a septuple-star system of
architecture (Aa-Ab)-B-C-D. Most of the presented systems are adequately bright
and showing deep enough eclipses, hence we call for new ground-based
observations for these extremely interesting multiples. Owing to this
motivation our catalog contains besides the ephemerides for both pairs also
their depths of eclipses and the light curve shapes as extracted from the TESS
data. These new ground based observations would be very useful for further
derivation of the mutual movement of both pairs on their orbit via detection of
the ETVs of both pairs for example.

Abstract:  The study of the development of structures on multiple scales in the cold
interstellar medium has experienced rapid expansion in the past decade, on both
the observational and the theoretical front. Spectral line studies at
(sub-)millimeter wavelengths over a wide range of physical scales have provided
unique probes of the kinematics of dense gas in star-forming regions, and have
been complemented by extensive, high dynamic range dust continuum surveys of
the column density structure of molecular cloud complexes, while dust
polarization maps have highlighted the role of magnetic fields. This has been
accompanied by increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations including new
physics (e.g., supernova driving, cosmic rays, non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics,
radiation pressure) and new techniques such as zoom-in simulations allowing
multi-scale studies. Taken together, these new data have emphasized the
anisotropic growth of dense structures on all scales, from giant ISM bubbles
driven by stellar feedback on $\sim$50--100 pc scales through parsec-scale
molecular filaments down to $< 0.1$ pc dense cores and $< 1000$ au protostellar
disks. Combining observations and theory, we present a coherent picture for the

Title:A Magnetogram-matching Method for Energizing Magnetic Flux Ropes Toward Eruption,"
Abstract:  We propose a new ``helicity-pumping'' method for energizing coronal
equilibria that contain a magnetic flux rope (MFR) toward an eruption. We
achieve this in a sequence of magnetohydrodynamics relaxations of small
line-tied pulses of magnetic helicity, each of which is simulated by a suitable
rescaling of the current-carrying part of the field. The whole procedure is
``magnetogram-matching'' because it involves no changes to the normal component
of the field at the photospheric boundary. The method is illustrated by
applying it to an observed force-free configuration whose MFR is modeled with
our regularized Biot--Savart law method. We find that, in spite of the bipolar
character of the external field, the MFR eruption is sustained by two
reconnection processes. The first, which we refer to as breakthrough
reconnection, is analogous to breakout reconnection in quadrupolar
configurations. It occurs at a quasi-separator inside a current layer that
wraps around the erupting MFR and is caused by the photospheric line-tying
effect. The second process is the classical flare reconnection, which develops
at the second quasi-separator inside a vertical current layer that is formed
below the erupting MFR. Both reconnection processes work in tandem with the
magnetic forces of the unstable MFR to propel it through the overlying ambient
field, and their interplay may also be relevant for the thermal processes
occurring in the plasma of solar flares. The considered example suggests that
our method will be beneficial for both the modeling of observed eruptive events
and theoretical studies of eruptions in idealized magnetic configurations.

Title:Wide binary pulsars from electron-capture supernovae,"
Abstract:  Neutron stars receive velocity kicks at birth in supernovae. Those formed in
electron-capture supernovae from super asymptotic giant branch stars -- the
lowest mass stars to end their lives in supernovae -- may receive significantly
lower kicks than typical neutron stars. Given that many massive stars are
members of wide binaries, this suggests the existence of a population of
low-mass ($1.25 < M_\mathrm{psr} / $M$_\odot < 1.3$), wide ($P_\mathrm{orb}
\gtrsim 10^{4}$\,day), eccentric ($e \sim 0.7$), unrecycled ($P_\mathrm{spin}
\sim 1$\,s) binary pulsars. The formation rate of such binaries is sensitive to
the mass range of (effectively) single stars leading to electron capture
supernovae, the amount of mass lost prior to the supernova, and the magnitude
of any natal kick imparted on the neutron star. We estimate that one such
binary pulsar should be observable in the Milky Way for every 10,000 isolated
pulsars, assuming that the width of the mass range of single stars leading to
electron-capture supernovae is $\lesssim 0.2$\,M$_\odot$, and that neutron
stars formed in electron-capture supernovae receive typical kicks less than
10\,km s$^{-1}$. We have searched the catalog of observed binary pulsars, but
find no convincing candidates that could be formed through this channel,
consistent with this low predicted rate. Future observations with the Square
Kilometre Array may detect this rare sub-class of binary pulsar and provide
strong constraints on the properties of electron-capture supernovae and their
progenitors.

Abstract:  In the past 15 years, the triaxial Schwarzschild orbit-superposition code by
van den Bosch et al. (2008) has been widely applied to study the dynamics of
galaxies. Recently, Quenneville et al. (2022) reported a bug in the orbit
calculation of this code, specifically in the mirroring procedure that is used
to speed up the computation. We have fixed the incorrect mirroring in DYNAMITE,
which is the publicly-released successor of the triaxial Schwarzschild code by
van den Bosch et al. (2008). In this study, we provide a thorough
quantification of how this bug has affected the results of dynamical analyses
performed with this code. We compare results obtained with the original and
corrected versions of DYNAMITE, and discuss the differences in the phase-space
distribution of a single orbit and in the global stellar orbit distribution, in
the mass estimate of the central black hole in the highly triaxial galaxy PGC
46832, and in the measurement of intrinsic shape and enclosed mass for more
than 50 galaxies. Focusing on the typical scientific applications of a
Schwarzschild triaxial code, in all our tests we find that differences are
negligible with respect to the statistical and systematic uncertainties. We
conclude that previous results with the van den Bosch et al. (2008) triaxial
Schwarzschild code are not significantly affected by the incorrect mirroring.

Title:Long-term instability of the inner Solar System: numerical experiments,"
Abstract:  Apart from being chaotic, the inner planets in the Solar System constitute an
open system, as they are forced by the regular long-term motion of the outer
ones. No integrals of motion can bound a priori the stochastic wanderings in
their high-dimensional phase space. Still, the probability of a dynamical
instability is remarkably low over the next 5 billion years, a timescale
thousand times longer than the Lyapunov time. The dynamical half-life of
Mercury has indeed been estimated recently at 40 billion years. By means of the
computer algebra system TRIP, we consider a set of dynamical models resulting
from truncation of the forced secular dynamics recently proposed for the inner
planets at different degrees in eccentricities and inclinations. Through
ensembles of $10^3$ to $10^5$ numerical integrations spanning 5 to 100 Gyr, we
find that the Hamiltonian truncated at degree 4 practically does not allow any
instability over 5 Gyr. The destabilisation is mainly due to terms of degree 6.
This surprising result suggests an analogy to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou
problem, in which tangency to Toda Hamiltonian explains the very long timescale
of thermalisation, which Fermi unsuccessfully looked for.

Title:Accreting White Dwarfs: Effect of WD Composition on Helium Ignition During Slow Accretion,"
Abstract:  Understanding the explosion mechanism of type Ia supernova is among the most
challenging issues in astrophysics. Accretion of matter on a carbon-oxygen
white dwarf from a companion star is one of the most important keys in this
regard. Our aim is to study the effects of WD composition on various parameters
during the accretion of helium rich matter at a slow rate. We have used the
computer simulation code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)
to understand the variations in the properties such as specific heat
(\textit{$C_P$}) and degeneracy parameter (\textit{$\eta$}). The profile of
specific heat shows a discontinuity and that of the degeneracy parameter shows
a dip near the ignition region. As expected, the size of WD decreases and
\textit{g} increases during the accretion. However, a red-giant-like expansion
is observed after the rapid ignition towards the end. Our study explains the
reason behind the delay in onset of helium ignition due to the difference in
carbon abundance in a CO-WD. We find that white dwarfs of the lower abundance
of carbon accrete slightly longer before the onset of helium ignition.

Title:Coplanar gas inflow can be hidden within warped galactic gas disks,"
Abstract:  Simulations suggest that galactic gas disks can be treated as ""modified
accretion disks"", in which coplanar gas spirals into the inner regions of the
disk, while being consumed by star-formation and removed by outflows.
Observationally there is little evidence for such inflows within the outer
disks of galaxies. Taking realistic gas surface densities from observations,
the radial velocity of the inflow is only a few km s$^{-1}$ within two
scalelengths, but gradually increases with radius to of order 50-100 km
s$^{-1}$ at the very outer disk. The effects of this inflow on the 2-d velocity
field are examined and shown to be broadly similar to those produced by warped
disks, with twist distortions of both the kinematic major and minor axes. By
examining the twists of kinematic distortions and the spiral arms for a sample
of nearby galaxies, we find that the effect of warps are likely to dominate
over the effect of radial inflows. However, we then model mock HI velocity
fields that combine warps with inflow velocities of the strength required in
the modified accretion disks, and show that these composite systems can
actually also be very well matched by pure warped disk models, with $\sim$85\%
of the mock galaxies having a mean absolute error in the residuals of less than
10 km s$^{-1}$. This suggests that the signatures of significant radial inflows
can easily be ""hidden"" within the warps and that this may therefore explain the
apparent failure to detect radial inflows in galactic disks.

an SNR on the theoretically derived Sigma-D tracks; the second one based on the
forms of radio spectra; and the third one, based on the magnetic field
strengths that are estimated through the equipartition (eqp) calculation. Using
a combination of these methods, developed over the last two decades by the
Belgrade SNR Research Group, we can estimate the evolutionary status of SNRs.
This concept helps radio observers to determine preliminarily the stage of the
evolution of an SNR observed in radio domain. Additionally, this concept was
applied for several SNRs, observed by the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA), and the corresponding results are reviewed here. Moreover, some of the
results are revised in this review to reflect the updated recently published
Sigma-D and eqp analyses.

Title:Search for gamma-ray emission from a galactic supernova with the anticoincidence system of SPI,"
Abstract:  The detection of the very early gamma-emission of a Type Ia supernova (SNIa)
could provide a deep insight on the explosion mechanism and nature of the
progenitor. However this has not been yet possible as a consequence of the
expected low luminosity and the distance at which all the events have occurred
up to now. A SNIa occurring in our Galaxy could provide a unique opportunity to
perform such measurement. The problem is that the optical flux would probably
be so attenuated by interstellar extinction that would prevent triggering the
observations with gamma-spectrometers at the due time. In this paper we analyse
the possibility of using the anticoincidence system (ACS) of the spectrometer
SPI on board of the INTEGRAL space observatory for detecting the early
gamma-ray emission of a SNIa as a function of the explosion model and distance
as well as of pointing direction. Our results suggest that such detection is
possible at about 6 - 12 days after the explosion and, at the same time, we can
discard missing any hidden explosion during the lifetime of INTEGRAL.

Title:Arecibo and FAST Timing Follow-up of twelve Millisecond Pulsars Discovered in Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey,"
Abstract:  We report the phase-connected timing ephemeris, polarization pulse profiles,
Faraday rotation measurements, and Rotating-Vector-Model (RVM) fitting results
of twelve millisecond pulsars (MSPs) discovered with the Five-hundred-meter
Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in the Commensal radio Astronomy FAST
survey (CRAFTS). The timing campaigns were carried out with FAST and Arecibo
over three years. Eleven of the twelve pulsars are in neutron star - white
dwarf binary systems, with orbital periods between 2.4 and 100 d. Ten of them
have spin periods, companion masses, and orbital eccentricities that are
consistent with the theoretical expectations for MSP - Helium white dwarf (He
WD) systems. The last binary pulsar (PSR J1912$-$0952) has a significantly
smaller spin frequency and a smaller companion mass, the latter could be caused
by a low orbital inclination for the system. Its orbital period of 29 days is
well within the range of orbital periods where some MSP - He WD systems have
shown anomalous eccentricities, however, the eccentricity of PSR J1912$-$0952
is typical of what one finds for the remaining MSP - He WD systems.

Title:Magnetic field inference from the spectral region around the Mg I $b_2$ line using the weak-field approximation,"
Abstract:  We investigated the applicability of the weak-field approximation (WFA) for
retrieving the depth-dependent line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field from the
spectral region containing the Mg I $b_2$ spectral line and two photospheric Ti
I and Fe I lines. We constructed and used a 12-level model for Mg I atom that
realistically reproduces the $b_2$ line profile of the mean quiet Sun. We
tested the applicability of the WFA to the spectra computed from the FAL C
atmospheric model with ad hoc added different magnetic and velocity fields.
Then, we extended the analysis to the spectra computed from two 3D
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) MURaM simulations of the solar atmosphere. The first
MHD cube is used to estimate the Stokes V formation heights of each spectral
line. These heights correspond to optical depths at which the standard
deviation of the difference between the WFA-inferred magnetic field and the
magnetic field in the MHD cube is minimal. The estimated formation heights are
verified using the second MHD cube. The LOS magnetic field retrieved by the WFA
is reliable for the magnetic field strength up to 1.4 kG even when moderate
velocity gradients are present. The exception is the Fe I line, for which we
found a strong discrepancy in the inferred magnetic fields because of the line
blend. We estimated the Stokes $V$ formation heights of each spectral line to
be: $\log\tau_\mathrm{Fe}=-2.6$, $\log\tau_\mathrm{Mg}=-3.3$, and
$\log\tau_\mathrm{Ti}=-1.8$. We were able to estimate the LOS magnetic field
from the MURaM cube at these heights with the uncertainty of 150 G for the Fe I
and Ti I lines and only 40 G for the Mg I $b_2$ line. Using the WFA we can
quickly get a reliable estimate of the structure of the LOS magnetic field in
the observed region. The Mg I $b_2$ line profile calculated from the quiet Sun
MURaM simulation agrees very well with the observed mean spectrum of the quiet
Sun.

Title:Impact of radial truncation on global 2D hydrodynamic simulations for a Sun-like model,"
Abstract:  Stellar convection is a non-local process responsible for the transport of
heat and chemical species. It can lead to enhanced mixing through convective
overshooting and excitation of internal gravity waves (IGWs) at convective
boundaries. The relationship between these processes is still not well
understood and requires global hydrodynamic simulations to capture the
important large-scale dynamics. The steep stratification in stellar interiors
suggests that the radial extent of such simulations can affect the convection
dynamics, the IGWs in the stably stratified radiative zone, and the depth of
the overshooting layer. We investigate these effects using two-dimensional
global simulations performed with the fully compressible stellar hydrodynamics
code MUSIC. We compare eight different radial truncations of the same
solar-like stellar model evolved over approximately 400 convective turnover
times. We find that the location of the inner boundary has an insignificant
effect on the convection dynamics, the convective overshooting and the
travelling IGWs. We relate this to the background conditions at the lower
convective boundary which are unaffected by the truncation, as long as a
significantly deep radiative layer is included in the simulation domain.
However, we find that extending the outer boundary by only a few percent of the
stellar radius significantly increases the velocity and temperature
perturbations in the convection zone, the overshooting depth, the power and the
spectral slope of the IGWs. The effect is related to the background conditions
at the outer boundary, which are determined in essence by the hydrostatic
stratification and the given luminosity.

Title:Diffstar: A Fully Parametric Physical Model for Galaxy Assembly History,"
Abstract:  We present Diffstar, a smooth parametric model for the in-situ star formation
history (SFH) of galaxies. Diffstar is distinct from conventional SFH models
that are used to interpret the spectral energy distribution (SED) of an
observed galaxy, because our model is parametrized directly in terms of basic
features of galaxy formation physics. The Diffstar model assumes that star
formation is fueled by the accretion of gas into the dark matter halo of the
galaxy, and at the foundation of Diffstar is a parametric model for halo mass
assembly, Diffmah. We include parametrized ingredients for the fraction of
accreted gas that is eventually transformed into stars, $\epsilon_{\rm ms},$
and for the timescale over which this transformation occurs, $\tau_{\rm cons};$
some galaxies in Diffstar experience a quenching event at time $t_{\rm q},$ and
may subsequently experience rejuvenated star formation. We fit the SFHs of
galaxies predicted by the IllustrisTNG (TNG) and UniverseMachine (UM)
simulations with the Diffstar parameterization, and show that our model is
sufficiently flexible to describe the average stellar mass histories of
galaxies in both simulations with an accuracy of $\sim0.1$ dex across most of
cosmic time. We use Diffstar to compare TNG to UM in common physical terms,
finding that: (i) star formation in UM is less efficient and burstier relative
to TNG; (ii) galaxies in UM have longer gas consumption timescales, $\tau_{\rm
cons}$, relative to TNG; (iii) rejuvenated star formation is ubiquitous in UM,
whereas quenched TNG galaxies rarely experience sustained rejuvenation; and
(iv) in both simulations, the distributions of $\epsilon_{\rm ms}$, $\tau_{\rm
cons}$, and $t_{\rm q}$ share a common characteristic dependence upon halo
mass, and present significant correlations with halo assembly history.

Title:Interstellar planetesimals,"
Abstract:  During the formation of our solar system, a large number of planetesimals
were ejected into interstellar space by gravitational encounters with the
planets. Debris disks observations and numerical simulations indicate that many
other planetary systems, now known to be quite common, would have undergone a
similar dynamical clearing process. It is therefore expected that the galaxy
should be teeming with expelled planetesimals, largely unaltered since their
ejection. This is why astronomers were perplexed that none had been detected
passing through the solar system. Then, in 2017, the discovery of1I/'Oumuamua
transformed the situation from puzzlement to bewilderment. Its brief visit and
limited observations left important questions about its nature and origin
unanswered and raised the possibility that 1I/'Oumuamua could be a
never-seen-before intermediate product of planet formation. If so, this could
open a new observational window to study the primordial building blocks of
planets, setting unprecedented constraints on planet formation models. Two
years later 2I/Borisov was discovered, with an unquestionable cometary
composition, confirming that a population of icy interstellar planetesimals
exists. These objects have remained largely unchanged since their ejection,
like time capsules of their planetary system most distant past. Interstellar
planetesimals could potentially be trapped into star and planet formation
environments, acting as seeds for planet formation, helping overcome the
meter-size barrier that challenges the growth of cm-sized pebbles into km-sized
objects. Interstellar planetesimals play a pivotal role in our understanding of
planetary system formation and evolution and point to the possibility that one
day, we will be able to hold a fragment from another world in our hand.

Title:On the faintest solar coronal hard X-rays observed with FOXSI,"
Abstract:  Solar nanoflares are small eruptive events releasing magnetic energy in the
quiet corona. If nanoflares follow the same physics as their larger
counterparts, they should emit hard X-rays (HXRs) but with a rather faint
intensity. A copious and continuous presence of nanoflares would deliver
enormous amounts of energy into the solar corona, possibly accounting for its
high temperatures. To date, there has not been any direct observation of such
sustained and persistent HXRs from the quiescent Sun. However, Hannah et al. in
2010 constrained the quiet Sun HXR emission using almost 12 days of quiescent
solar-off-pointing observations by RHESSI. These observations set upper limits
at $3.4\times 10^{-2}$ photons$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ keV$^{-1}$ and
$9.5\times 10^{-4}$ photons$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ keV$^{-1}$ for the 3-6
keV and 6-12 keV energy ranges, respectively. Observing feeble HXRs is
challenging because it demands high sensitivity and dynamic range instruments
in HXRs. The Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) sounding rocket
experiment excels in these two attributes. Particularly, FOXSI completed its
third successful flight (FOXSI-3) on September 7th, 2018. During FOXSI-3's
flight, the Sun exhibited a fairly quiet configuration, displaying only one
aged non-flaring active region. Using the entire $\sim$6.5 minutes of FOXSI-3
data, we constrained the quiet Sun emission in HXRs. We found $2\sigma$ upper
limits in the order of $\sim 10^{-3}$ photons$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$
keV$^{-1}$ for the 5-10 keV energy range. FOXSI-3's upper limit is consistent
with what was reported by Hannah et al., 2010, but FOXSI-3 achieved this result
using $\sim$1/2640 less time than RHESSI. A possible future spacecraft using
FOXSI's concept would allow enough observation time to constrain the current
HXR quiet Sun limits further or perhaps even make direct detections.

Title:Updating non-standard neutrinos properties with Planck-CMB data and full-shape analysis of BOSS and eBOSS galaxies,"
Abstract:  Using the latest observational data from Planck-CMB and its combination with
the pre-reconstructed full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum measurements from
the BOSS DR12 sample and eBOSS LRG DR16 sample, we report the observational
constraints on the cosmic neutrino properties given by the extended
$\Lambda$CDM scenario: $\Lambda$CDM + $N_{\rm eff}$ + $\sum m_{\nu}$ +
$c^2_{\rm eff}$ + $c^2_{\rm vis}$ + $\xi_{\nu}$, and its particular case
$\Lambda$CDM + $c^2_{\rm eff}$ + $c^2_{\rm vis}$ + $\xi_{\nu}$, where $N_{\rm
eff}$, $\sum m_{\nu}$, $c^2_{\rm eff}$, $c^2_{\rm vis}$, $\xi_{\nu}$ are the
effective number of species, the total neutrino mass, the sound speed in the
neutrinos rest frame, the viscosity parameter and the degeneracy parameter
quantifying a cosmological leptonic asymmetry, respectively. We observe that
the combination of FS power spectrum measurements with the CMB data
significantly improves the parametric space of the models compared to the CMB
data alone case. We find no evidence for neutrinos properties other than the
ones predicted by the standard cosmological theory. Our most robust
observational constraints are given by CMB + BOSS analysis. For the generalized
extended $\Lambda$CDM scenario, we find $c^2_{\rm
eff}=0.3304^{+0.0064}_{-0.0075}$, $c^2_{\rm vis}=0.301^{+0.037}_{-0.033}$,
$\xi_{\nu} < 0.05$, $N_{\rm eff}=2.90 \pm 0.15$ at 68\% CL, with $\sum m_{\nu}
< 0.116$ eV at 95\% CL. These are the strongest limits ever reported for these
extended $\Lambda$CDM scenarios.

Title:Regularized phase-space volume for the three-body problem,"
Abstract:  The micro-canonical phase-space volume for the three-body problem is an
elementary quantity of intrinsic interest, and within the flux-based
statistical theory, it sets the scale of the disintegration time. While the
bare phase-volume diverges, we show that a regularized version can be defined
by subtracting a reference phase-volume, which is associated with hierarchical
configurations. The reference quantity, also known as a counter-term, can be
chosen from a 1-parameter class. The regularized phase-volume of a given
(negative) total energy, $\bar\sigma(E)$, is evaluated. First, it is reduced to
a function of the masses only, which is sensitive to the choice of a
regularization scheme only through an additive constant. Then, analytic
integration is used to reduce the integration to a sphere, known as shape
sphere. Finally, the remaining integral is evaluated numerically, and presented
by a contour plot in parameter space. Regularized phase-volumes are presented
for both the planar three-body system and the full 3d system. In the test mass
limit, the regularized phase-volume is found to become negative, thereby
signalling the breakdown of the non-hierarchical statistical theory. This work
opens the road to the evaluation of $\bar\sigma(E,L)$, where $L$ is the total
angular momentum, and it turn, to comparison with simulation determined
disintegration times.

Title:The Detection of Deuterated Water in the Large Magellanic Cloud with ALMA,"
Abstract:  We report the first detection of deuterated water (HDO) toward an
extragalactic hot core. The HDO 2$_{11}$-2$_{12}$ line has been detected toward
hot cores N105-2A and 2B in the N105 star-forming region in the low-metallicity
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) dwarf galaxy with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We have compared the HDO line luminosity
($L_{\rm HDO}$) measured toward the LMC hot cores to those observed toward a
sample of seventeen Galactic hot cores covering three orders of magnitude in
$L_{\rm HDO}$, four orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm
bol}$), and a wide range of Galactocentric distances (thus metallicities). The
observed values of $L_{\rm HDO}$ for the LMC hot cores fit very well into the
$L_{\rm HDO}$ trends with $L_{\rm bol}$ and metallicity observed toward the
Galactic hot cores. We have found that $L_{\rm HDO}$ seems to be largely
dependent on the source luminosity, but metallicity also plays a role. We
provide a rough estimate of the H$_2$O column density and abundance ranges
toward the LMC hot cores by assuming that HDO/H$_2$O toward the LMC hot cores
is the same as that observed in the Milky Way; the estimated ranges are
systematically lower than Galactic values. The spatial distribution and
velocity structure of the HDO emission in N105-2A is consistent with HDO being
the product of the low-temperature dust grain chemistry. Our results are in
agreement with the astrochemical model predictions that HDO is abundant
regardless of the extragalactic environment and should be detectable with ALMA
in external galaxies.

Title:Stochastic gravitational waves from long cosmic strings,"
Abstract:  We compute the expected strain power spectrum and energy density parameter of
the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) created by a network of
long cosmic strings evolving during the whole cosmic history. As opposed to
other studies, the contribution of cosmic string loops is discarded and our
result provides a robust lower bound of the expected signal that is applicable
to most string models. Our approach uses Nambu-Goto numerical simulations,
running during the radiation, transition and matter eras, in which we compute
the two-point unequal-time anisotropic stress correlators. These ones act as
source terms in the linearised equations of motion for the tensor modes, that
we solve using an exact Green's function integrator. Today, we find that the
rescaled strain power spectrum $(k/\mathcal{H}_0)^2 \mathcal{P}_h$ peaks on
Hubble scales and exhibits, at large wavenumbers, high frequency oscillations
around a plateau of amplitude $100 (GU)^2$. Most of the high frequency power is
generated by the long strings present in the matter era, the radiation era
contribution being smaller.

Title:TEM analyses of in situ presolar grains from unequilibrated ordinary chondrite LL3.0 Semarkona,"
Abstract:  We investigated six presolar grains from very primitive regions of the matrix
in the unequilibrated ordinary chondrite Semarkona with TEM. These grains
include one SiC, one oxide (Mg-Al spinel), and four silicates. Structural and
elemental compositional studies of presolar grains located within their
meteorite hosts have the potential to provide information on conditions and
processes throughout the grains' histories. Our analyses show that the SiC and
spinel grains are stoichiometric and well crystallized. In contrast, the
majority of the silicate grains are non-stoichiometric and poorly crystallized.
These findings are consistent with previous TEM studies of presolar grains from
interplanetary dust particles and chondritic meteorites. We interpret the
poorly crystalline nature, non-stoichiometry, more Fe- rather than Mg-rich
compositions, and/or compositional heterogeneities as features of the formation
by condensation under non-equilibrium conditions. Evidence for parent body
alteration includes rims with mobile elements (S or Fe) on the SiC grain and
one silicate grain. Other features characteristic of secondary processing in
the interstellar medium, the solar nebula, and/or on parent bodies, were not
observed or are better explained by processes operating in circumstellar
envelopes. In general, there was very little overprinting of primary features
of the presolar grains by secondary processes (e.g., ion irradiation,
grain-grain collisions, thermal metamorphism, aqueous alteration). This finding
underlines the need for additional TEM studies of presolar grains located in
the primitive matrix regions of Semarkona, to address gaps in our knowledge of
presolar grain populations accreted to ordinary chondrites.

Title:Galactic Component Mapping of Galaxy UGC 2885 by Machine Learning Classification,"
Abstract:  Automating classification of galaxy components is important for understanding
the formation and evolution of galaxies. Traditionally, only the larger galaxy
structures such as the spiral arms, bulge, and disc are classified. Here we use
machine learning (ML) pixel-by-pixel classification to automatically classify
all galaxy components within digital imagery of massive spiral galaxy UGC 2885.
Galaxy components include young stellar population, old stellar population,
dust lanes, galaxy center, outer disc, and celestial background. We test three
ML models: maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), random forest (RF), and support
vector machine (SVM). We use high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
digital imagery along with textural features derived from HST imagery, band
ratios derived from HST imagery, and distance layers. Textural features are
typically used in remote sensing studies and are useful for identifying
patterns within digital imagery. We run ML classification models with different
combinations of HST digital imagery, textural features, band ratios, and
distance layers to determine the most useful information for galaxy component
classification. Textural features and distance layers are most useful for
galaxy component identification, with the SVM and RF models performing the
best. The MLC model performs worse overall but has comparable performance to
SVM and RF in some circumstances. Overall, the models are best at classifying
the most spectrally unique galaxy components including the galaxy center, outer
disc, and celestial background. The most confusion occurs between the young
stellar population, old stellar population, and dust lanes. We suggest further
experimentation with textural features for astronomical research on small-scale
galactic structures.

Title:The intrinsic reddening of the Magellanic Clouds as traced by background galaxies -- III. The Large Magellanic Cloud,"
Abstract:  We present a map of the total intrinsic reddening across ~90 deg$^{2}$ of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) derived using optical (ugriz) and near-infrared
(IR; YJKs) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of background galaxies. The
reddening map is created from a sample of 222,752 early-type galaxies based on
the LEPHARE $\chi^{2}$ minimisation SED-fitting routine. We find excellent
agreement between the regions of enhanced intrinsic reddening across the
central (4x4 deg$^2$) region of the LMC and the morphology of the low-level
pervasive dust emission as traced by far-IR emission. In addition, we are able
to distinguish smaller, isolated enhancements that are coincident with known
star-forming regions and the clustering of young stars observed in morphology
maps. The level of reddening associated with the molecular ridge south of 30
Doradus is, however, smaller than in the literature reddening maps. The reduced
number of galaxies detected in this region, due to high extinction and
crowding, may bias our results towards lower reddening values. Our map is
consistent with maps derived from red clump stars and from the analysis of the
star formation history across the LMC. This study represents one of the first
large-scale categorisations of extragalactic sources behind the LMC and as such
we provide the LEPHARE outputs for our full sample of ~2.5 million sources.

Title:Solar-Cycle Variation of quiet-Sun Magnetism and Surface Gravity Oscillation Mode,"
Abstract:  The origin of the quiet Sun magnetism is under debate. Investigating the
solar cycle variation observationally in more detail can give us clues about
how to resolve the controversies. We investigate the solar cycle variation of
the most magnetically quiet regions and their surface gravity oscillation
($f$-) mode integrated energy ($E_f$). We use 12 years of HMI data and apply a
stringent selection criteria, based on spatial and temporal quietness, to avoid
any influence of active regions (ARs). We develop an automated high-throughput
pipeline to go through all available magnetogram data and to compute $E_f$ for
the selected quiet regions. We observe a clear solar cycle dependence of the
magnetic field strength in the most quiet regions containing several
supergranular cells. For patch sizes smaller than a supergranular cell, no
significant cycle dependence is detected. The $E_f$ at the supergranular scale
is not constant over time. During the late ascending phase of Cycle 24 (SC24,
2011-2012), it is roughly constant, but starts diminishing in 2013, as the
maximum of SC24 is approached. This trend continues until mid-2017, when hints
of strengthening at higher southern latitudes are seen. Slow strengthening
continues, stronger at higher latitudes than at the equatorial regions, but
$E_f$ never returns back to the values seen in 2011-2012. Also, the
strengthening trend continues past the solar minimum, to the years when SC25 is
already clearly ascending. Hence the $E_f$ behavior is not in phase with the
solar cycle. The anticorrelation of $E_f$ with the solar cycle in gross terms
is expected, but the phase shift of several years indicates a connection to the
poloidal large-scale magnetic field component rather than the toroidal one.
Calibrating AR signals with the QS $E_f$ does not reveal significant
enhancement of the $f$-mode prior to AR emergence.

Title:Not that simple: the metallicity dependence of the wide binary fraction changes with separation and stellar mass,"
Abstract:  The metallicity dependence of the wide binary fraction (WBF) is critical for
studying the formation of wide binaries. While controversial results have been
found in recent years. Here we combine the wide binary catalog recognized from
Gaia EDR3 and stellar parameters from LAMOST to investigate this topic. Taking
bias of the stellar temperature at given separations into account, we find that
the relationship between the WBF and metallicity depends on temperature for the
thin-disk at s > 200 AU. It changes from negative to positive as the
temperature increases from 4000 K to 7500 K. This temperature/mass dependence
is not seen for the thick-disk. Besides, the general tendency between the WBF
and metallicity varies with the separation, consistent with previous results.
It shows anti-correlation at small separations, s < 200 AU for the thin-disk
and s < 600 AU for the thick-disk. Then it becomes an ""arcuate"" shape at larger
separations (hundreds to thousands of AU), peaking at [Fe/H] ~ 0.1 for the
thin-disk and [Fe/H] ~ -0.5 for the thick disk. Finally it becomes roughly flat
for the thin-disk at 1000 < s < 10000 AU. Our work provides new observational
evidences for theoretical studies on binary formation and evolution.

different types of astrophysical $\gamma$-ray sources and their dependence on

extensively for reproducing results consistent with analytic models, in
particular for scenarios including C+O novae, O+Ne novae, Type Ia and
core-collapse supernovae. We also compare our results with similar models in

Abstract:  We present a detailed study of the evolution of the Galactic black hole
transient GRS 1716-249 during its 2016-2017 outburst at optical (Las Cumbres
Observatory), mid-infrared (Very Large Telescope), near-infrared (Rapid Eye
Mount telescope), and ultraviolet (the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope) wavelengths, along with archival radio and X-ray
data. We show that the optical/near-infrared and UV emission of the source
mainly originates from a multi-temperature accretion disk, while the
mid-infrared and radio emission are dominated by synchrotron emission from a
compact jet. The optical/UV flux density is correlated with the X-ray emission
when the source is in the hard state, consistent with an X-ray irradiated
accretion disk with an additional contribution from the viscous disk during the
outburst fade. We also report the long-term optical light curve of the source
and find that the quiescent i-band magnitude is 21.39$\pm$0.15 mag.
Furthermore, we discuss how previous estimates of the system parameters of the
source are based on various incorrect assumptions, and so are likely to be
inaccurate. By comparing our GRS 1716-249 dataset to those of other outbursting
black hole X-ray binaries, we find that while GRS 1716-249 shows similar X-ray
behaviour, it is noticeably optically fainter, if the literature distance of
2.4 kpc is adopted. Using several lines of reasoning, we argue that the source
distance is further than previously assumed in the literature, likely within

Title:The impact of stellar evolution on rotating star clusters: the gravothermal-gravogyro catastrophe and the formation of a bar of black holes,"
Abstract:  We present results from a suite of eight direct N-body simulations, performed
with \textsc{Nbody6++GPU}, representing realistic models of rotating star
clusters with up to $1.1\times 10^5$ stars. Our models feature primordial
(hard) binaries, a continuous mass spectrum, differential rotation, and tidal
mass loss induced by the overall gravitational field of the host galaxy. We
explore the impact of rotation and stellar evolution on the star cluster
dynamics. In all runs for rotating star clusters we detect a previously
predicted mechanism: an initial phase of violent relaxation followed by the
so-called gravogyro catastrophe. We find that the gravogyro catastrophe reaches
a finite amplitude, which depends in strength on the level of the bulk
rotation, and then levels off. After this phase the angular momentum is
transferred from high-mass to low-mass particles in the cluster (both stars and
compact objects). Simultaneously, the system becomes gravothermally unstable
and collapses, thus undergoing the so-called gravothermal-gravogyro
catastrophe. Comparing models with and without stellar evolution, we find an
interesting difference. When stellar evolution is not taken into account, the
whole process proceeds at a faster pace. The population of heavy objects tend
to form a triaxial structure that rotates in the cluster centre. When stellar
evolution is taken into account, we find that such a {\it rotating bar} is
populated by stellar black holes and their progenitors. The triaxial structure
becomes axisymmetric over time, but we also find that the models without
stellar evolution suffer repeated gravogyro catastrophes as sufficient angular
momentum and mass are removed by the tidal field.

Title:Insights into the origin of halo mass profiles from machine learning,"
Abstract:  The mass distribution of dark matter haloes is the result of the hierarchical
growth of initial density perturbations through mass accretion and mergers. We
use an interpretable machine-learning framework to provide physical insights
into the origin of the spherically-averaged mass profile of dark matter haloes.
We train a gradient-boosted-trees algorithm to predict the final mass profiles
of cluster-sized haloes, and measure the importance of the different inputs
provided to the algorithm. We find two primary scales in the initial conditions
(ICs) that impact the final mass profile: the density at approximately the
scale of the haloes' Lagrangian patch $R_L$ ($R\sim 0.7\, R_L$) and that in the
large-scale environment ($R\sim 1.7~R_L$). The model also identifies three
primary time-scales in the halo assembly history that affect the final profile:
(i) the formation time of the virialized, collapsed material inside the halo,
(ii) the dynamical time, which captures the dynamically unrelaxed, infalling
component of the halo over its first orbit, (iii) a third, most recent
time-scale, which captures the impact on the outer profile of recent massive
merger events. While the inner profile retains memory of the ICs, this
information alone is insufficient to yield accurate predictions for the outer
profile. As we add information about the haloes' mass accretion history, we
find a significant improvement in the predicted profiles at all radii. Our
machine-learning framework provides novel insights into the role of the ICs and
the mass assembly history in determining the final mass profile of
cluster-sized haloes.

Title:A tentative 114-minute orbital period challenges the ultra-compact nature of the X-ray binary 4U 1812-12,"
Abstract:  We present a detailed time-resolved photometric study of the ultra-compact
X-ray binary candidate 4U 1812-12. The multicolor light curves obtained with
HiPERCAM on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias show an aprox 114 min
modulation similar to a superhump. Under this interpretation, this period
should lie very close to the orbital period of the system. Contrary to what its
other observational properties suggest (namely, persistent dim luminosity, low
optical-to-X-ray flux ratio and lack of hydrogen features in the optical
spectrum), this implies that 4U1812-12 is most likely not an ultra-compact
X-ray binary, which are usually defined as systems with orbital periods lower
than 80 min. We discuss the nature of the system, showing that a scenario in
which 4U 1812-12 is the progenitor of an ultra-compact X-ray binary may
reconcile all the observables.

"Title:Circumnuclear Medium around the Central AGN in a Cool-Core Cluster, Abell 1644-South","
Abstract:  We present the circumnuclear multi-phase gas properties of the brightest
cluster galaxy (BCG) in the center of Abell 1644-South. A1644-S is the main
cluster in a merging system, which is well known for X-ray hot gas sloshing in
its core. The sharply peaked X-ray profile of A1644-S implies the presence of a
strongly cooling gas core. In this study, we analyze ALMA CO (1-0) data, JVLA
HI data, and KaVA 22 GHz data for the central region of A1644-S to probe the
potential origin of the cool gas and its role in (re)powering the central
active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find CO clumps distributed in an arc shape
along the X-ray gas sloshing, which is suggestive of a connection between the
cold gas and the hot intracluster medium (ICM). HI and CN are detected in
absorption against the AGN continuum emission. The absorption dip is observed
at the systemic velocity of the BCG with an extended, redshifted tail. Based on
the spatial and spectral configurations of the HI, CN and CO gases, it is
inferred that cool gas spirals into the core of the BCG, which is then fed to
the central AGN. Indeed, our KaVA observation reveals a parsec-scale bipolar
jet, implying that this AGN could have been (re)powered quite recently.
Combining this, we suggest that some cold gas in A1644-S could have been formed
from the cooling of the ICM, triggering the activity of the central AGN in the
early development of a cool-core cluster.

Title:Concordance between observations and simulations in the evolution of the mass relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies,"
Abstract:  We carry out a comparative analysis of the relation between the mass of
supermassive black holes (BHs) and the stellar mass of their host galaxies at
$0.2<z<1.7$ using well-matched observations and multiple state-of-the-art
simulations (e.g., Massive Black II, Horizon-AGN, Illustris, TNG and a
semi-analytic model). The observed sample consists of 646 uniformly-selected
SDSS quasars ($0.2 < z < 0.8$) and 32 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs;
$1.2<z<1.7$) with imaging from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) for the former and
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for the latter. We first add realistic
observational uncertainties to the simulation data and then construct a
simulated sample in the same manner as the observations. Over the full redshift
range, our analysis demonstrates that all simulations predict a level of
intrinsic scatter of the scaling relations comparable to the observations which
appear to agree with the dispersion of the local relation. Regarding the mean
relation, Horizon-AGN and TNG are in closest agreement with the observations at
low and high redshift ($z\sim$ 0.2 and 1.5, respectively) while the other
simulations show subtle differences within the uncertainties. For insight into
the physics involved, the scatter of the scaling relation, seen in the SAM, is
reduced by a factor of two and closer to the observations after adopting a new
feedback model that considers the geometry of the AGN outflow. The consistency
in the dispersion with redshift in our analysis supports the importance of both
quasar- and radio-mode feedback prescriptions in the simulations. Finally, we
highlight the importance of increasing the sensitivity (e.g., using the James
Webb Space Telescope), thereby pushing to lower masses and minimizing biases
due to selection effects.

Title:Primordial Clocks within Stochastic Gravitational Wave Anisotropies,"
Abstract:  A first-order phase transition in the early universe can give an observable
stochastic gravitational background (SGWB), which will necessarily have
primordial anisotropies across the sky. In multi-field inflationary scenarios,
these anisotropies may have a significant isocurvature component very different
from adiabatic fluctuations, providing an alternate discovery channel for high
energy physics at inflationary scales. Here, we consider classically
oscillating heavy fields during inflation that can imprint distinctive
scale-invariance-breaking features in the power spectrum of primordial
anisotropies. While such features are highly constrained in the cosmic
microwave background, we show that their amplitude can be observably large in
isocurvature SGWB, despite both probing a similar period of inflation.
Measuring SGWB multipoles at the required level, $\ell \sim {\cal O}(10-100)$,
will be technologically challenging. However, we expect that early detection of
a strong isotropic SGWB, and the guarantee of anisotropies, would spur
development of next-generation detectors with sufficient sensitivity, angular
resolution, and foreground discrimination.

Title:The Twin Radio galaxy TRG J104454+354055,"
Abstract:  We report observations of a bright dumb-bell system of galaxies ($z =0.162$)
with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope ($u$GMRT), which show that
each member of this gravitationally bound pair of galaxies hosts bipolar radio
jets extended on 100 kiloparsec scales. Only two cases of such radio morphology
have been reported previously, both being dumb-bell systems, as well. The
famous first example, 3C 75, was discovered 4 decades ago, and the second case
was discovered 3 decades ago. This implies that such `Twin-Radio-Galaxies'
(TRGs) are an exceedingly rare phenomenon. As in the case of its two senior
cousins, the bi-polar radio jets of the present TRG (J104454+354055) exhibit
strong wiggles and are edge-darkened (Fanaroff-Riley class I). However, there
are important differences, too. For instance, the jets in the present TRG do
not merge and, moreover, show no signs of distortion due to an external
crosswind. This makes the present TRG a much neater laboratory for studying the
physics of (sideway) colliding jets of relativistic plasma. This TRG has a
Wide-Angle-Tail (WAT) neighbour hosted by another bright galaxy belonging to
the same group, which appears to be moving towards the TRG.

Title:Implementation of advanced Riemann solvers in a neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamics code in numerical relativity and its application to a binary neutron star merger,"
Abstract:  We implement advanced Riemann solvers HLLC and HLLD
\cite{Mignone:2005ft,MUB:2009} together with an advanced constrained transport
scheme \cite{Gardiner:2007nc} in a numerical-relativity neutrino-radiation
magnetohydrodynamics code. We validate our implementation by performing a
series of one- and multi-dimensional test problems for relativistic
hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in both Minkowski spacetime and a static
black hole spacetime. We find that the numerical solutions with the advanced
Riemann solvers are more accurate than those with the HLLE solver
\cite{DelZanna:2002rv}, which was originally implemented in our code. As an
application to numerical relativity, we simulate an asymmetric binary neutron
star merger leading to a short-lived massive neutron star both with and without
magnetic fields. We find that the lifetime of the rotating massive neutron star
formed after the merger and also the amount of the tidally-driven dynamical
ejecta are overestimated when we employ the diffusive HLLE solver. We also find
that the magnetorotational instability is less resolved when we employ the HLLE
solver because of the solver's large numerical diffusivity. This causes a
spurious enhancement both of magnetic winding resulting from large scale
poloidal magnetic fields, and also of the energy of the outflow induced by
magnetic pressure.

Title:Performance of ESPRESSO's high resolution 4x2 binning for characterizing intervening absorbers towards faint quasars,"
Abstract:  As of October 2021 (Period 108), the European Southern Observatory (ESO)
offers a new mode of the ESPRESSO spectrograph designed to use the High
Resolution grating with 4x2 binning (spatial by spectral; HR42 mode) with the
specific objective of observing faint targets with a single Unit Telescope at
Paranal. We validated the new HR42 mode using four hours of on-target
observations of the quasar J0003-2603, known to host an intervening metal-poor
absorber along the line of sight. The capabilities of the ESPRESSO HR42 mode
(resolving power R~137 000) were evaluated by comparing to a UVES spectrum of
the same target with a similar integration time but lower resolving power (R~48
000). For both data sets we tested the ability to decompose the velocity
profile of the intervening absorber using Voigt profile fitting and extracted
the total column densities of CIV, NI, SiII, AlII, FeII, and NiII. With ~3x the
resolving power and ~2x lower S/N for a nearly equivalent exposure time, the
ESPRESSO data is able to just as accurately characterize the individual
components of the absorption lines as the comparison UVES data, but has the
added bonus of identifying narrower components not detected by UVES. For UVES
to provide similar spectral resolution (R>100 000; 0.3'' slit) and the broad
wavelength coverage of ESPRESSO, the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) supplied by
ESO estimates 8 hrs of exposure time spread over two settings; requiring double
the time investment than that of ESPRESSO's HR42 mode whilst not properly
sampling the UVES spectral resolution element. Thus ESPRESSO's HR42 mode offers
nearly triple the resolving power of UVES (0.8'' slit to match typical ambient
conditions at Paranal) and provides more accurate characterization of quasar
absorption features for an equivalent exposure time.

Title:Forecasting ground-based sensitivity to the Rayleigh scattering of the CMB in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds,"
Abstract:  The Rayleigh scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off the
neutral hydrogen produced during recombination effectively creates an
additional scattering surface after recombination that encodes new cosmological
information, including the expansion and ionization history of the universe. A
first detection of Rayleigh scattering is a tantalizing target for
next-generation CMB experiments. We have developed a Rayleigh scattering
forecasting pipeline that includes instrumental effects, atmospheric noise, and
astrophysical foregrounds (e.g., Galactic dust, cosmic infrared background, or
CIB, and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect). We forecast the Rayleigh
scattering detection significance for several upcoming ground-based
experiments, including SPT-3G+, Simons Observatory, CCAT-prime, and CMB-S4, and
examine the limitations from atmospheric and astrophysical foregrounds as well
as potential mitigation strategies. When combined with Planck data, we estimate
that the ground-based experiments will detect Rayleigh scattering with a
significance between 1.6 and 3.7, primarily limited by atmospheric noise and
the CIB.

Title:Estimating the Impact of foregrounds on the Future Detection of Rayleigh scattering,"
Abstract:  Rayleigh scattering of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by neutral
hydrogen shortly after recombination leaves frequency-dependent imprints on
intensity and polarization fluctuations. High signal-to-noise observations of
CMB Rayleigh scattering would provide additional insight into the physics of
recombination, including greater constraining power for parameters like the
primordial helium fraction, the light relic density, and the sum of neutrino
masses. However, such a measurement of CMB Rayleigh scattering is challenging
due to the presence of astrophysical foregrounds, which are more intense at the
high frequencies, where the effects of Rayleigh scattering are most prominent.
Here we forecast the detectability of CMB Rayleigh scattering including
foreground removal using blind internal linear combination methods for a set of
near-future surveys. We show that atmospheric effects for ground-based
observatories and astrophysical foregrounds pose a significant hindrance to
detecting CMB Rayleigh scattering with experiments planned for this decade,
though a high-significance measurement should be possible with a future CMB
satellite.

Title:Front Propagation from Radiative Sources,"
Abstract:  Fronts are regions of transition from one state to another in a medium. They
are present in many areas of science and applied mathematics, and modelling
them and their evolution is often an effective way of treating the underlying
phenomena responsible for them. In this paper, we propose a new approach to
modelling front propagation, which characterises the evolution of structures
surrounding radiative sources. This approach is generic and has a wide range of
applications, particularly when dealing with the propagation of phase or state
transitions in media surrounding radiation emitting objects. As an
illustration, we show an application in modelling the propagation of ionisation
fronts around early stars during the cosmological Epoch of Reionisation (EoR)
and show that the results are consistent with those of existing equations but
provide much richer sources of information.

Title:Dark matter cores in massive high-$z$ galaxies formed by baryonic clumps,"
Abstract:  The rotation curves of some star forming massive galaxies at redshift two
decline over the radial range of a few times the effective radius, indicating a
significant deficit of dark matter (DM) mass in the galaxy centre. The DM mass
deficit is interpreted as the existence of a DM density core rather than the
cuspy structure predicted by the standard cosmological model. A recent study
proposed that a galaxy merger, in which the smaller satellite galaxy is
significantly compacted by dissipative contraction of the galactic gas, can
heat the centre of the host galaxy and help make a large DM core. By using an
$N$-body simulation, we find that a large amount of DM mass is imported to the
centre by the merging satellite, making this scenario an unlikely solution for
the DM mass deficit. In this work, we consider giant baryonic clumps in high
redshift galaxies as alternative heating source for creating the baryon
dominated galaxies with a DM core. Due to dynamical friction, the orbit of
clumps decays in a few Gyr and the baryons condensate at the galactic centre.
As a back-reaction, the halo centre is heated up and the density cusp is
flattened out. The combination of the baryon condensation and core formation
makes the galaxy baryon dominated in the central 2-5 kpc, comparable to the
effective radius of the observed galaxies. Thus, the dynamical heating by giant
baryonic clumps is a viable mechanism for explaining the observed dearth of DM
in high redshift galaxies.

Title:Modal compression of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum,"
Abstract:  We extend the modal decomposition method, previously applied to compress the
information in the real-space bispectrum, to the anisotropic redshift-space
galaxy bispectrum. In the modal method approach, the bispectrum is expanded on
a basis of smooth functions of triangles and their orientations, such that a
set of modal expansion coefficients can capture the information in the
bispectrum. We assume a reference survey and compute Fisher forecasts for the
compressed modal bispectrum and two other basis decompositions of the
redshift-space bispectrum in the literature, one based on (single) spherical
harmonics and another based on tripolar spherical harmonics. In each case, we
compare the forecasted constraints from the compressed statistic with
forecasted constraints from the full, uncompressed bispectrum which includes
all triangles and orientations. Our main result is that all three compression
methods achieve good recovery of the full information content of the
bispectrum, but the modal decomposition approach achieves this the most
efficiently: only 14 (42) modal expansion coefficients are necessary to obtain
constraints that are within 10% (2%) of the full bispectrum result. The next
most efficient decomposition is the one based on tripolar spherical harmonics,
while the spherical harmonic multipoles are the least efficient.

Title:Redshifts of radio sources in the Million Quasars Catalogue from machine learning,"
Abstract:  With the aim of using machine learning techniques to obtain photometric
redshifts based upon a source's radio spectrum alone, we have extracted the
radio sources from the Million Quasars Catalogue. Of these, 44,119 have a
spectroscopic redshift, required for model validation, and for which photometry
could be obtained. Using the radio spectral properties as features, we fail to
find a model which can reliably predict the redshifts, although there is the
suggestion that the models improve with the size of the training sample. Using
the near-infrared--optical--ultraviolet bands magnitudes, we obtain reliable
predictions based on the 12,503 radio sources which have all of the required
photometry. From the 80:20 training--validation split, this gives only 2501
validation sources, although training the sample upon our previous SDSS model
gives comparable results for all 12,503 sources. This makes us confident that
SkyMapper, which will survey southern sky in the u, v, g, r, i, z bands, can be
used to predict the redshifts of radio sources detected with the Square
Kilometre Array. By using machine learning to impute the magnitudes missing
from much of the sample, we can predict the redshifts for 32,698 sources, an
increase from 28% to 74% of the sample, at the cost of increasing the outlier
fraction by a factor of 1.4. While the ""optical"" band data prove successful, at
this stage we cannot rule out the possibility of a radio photometric redshift,
given sufficient data which may be necessary to overcome the relatively
featureless radio spectra.

Title:Characteristics and evolution of Be-type high mass X-ray binaries as potential Ultraluminous X-ray Sources,"
Abstract:  Some ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) exhibit X-ray pulses, and their
central sources are thought to be neutron stars. It has also been suggested
that some are transient sources with Be-type donors. In this study, we use the
mass accretion model of a Be-type high mass X-ray binary (BeHMXB) to estimate
the conditions under which a giant X-ray burst caused by a BeHMXB exceeds the
Eddington luminosity. Moreover, we investigate the duration for which BeHMXBs
can be observed as transient ULXs with bursts above the Eddington luminosity
during binary evolutions. The results indicate that BeHMXBs could be ULXs for a
typical duration of approximately 1 Myr. Comparisons with nearby observed
BeHMXBs indicate that many binary systems have the potential to become ULXs
during their evolution. Particularly, a BeHMXB system tends to become a ULX
when the Be donor has a dense deccretion disc aligned with the orbital plane.
Because BeHMXBs are very common objects and a significant number of them can
become ULXs, we conclude that a reasonable fraction of the observed ULXs could
consist of evolved BeHMXBs.

Title:The jet and resolved features of the central supermassive black hole of M 87 observed with EHT,"
Abstract:  We report our independent image reconstruction of the M 87 from the public
data of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaborators (EHTC). Our result is
different from the image published by the EHTC. Our analysis shows that (a) the
structure at 230 GHz is consistent with those of lower frequency VLBI
observations, (b) the jet structure is evident at 230 GHz extending from the
core to a few mas, though the intensity rapidly decreases along the axis, and
(c) the unresolved core is resolved into bright three features presumably
showing an initial jet with a wide opening angle of about 70 deg.
The ring-like structures of the EHTC can be created not only from the public
data, but also from the simulated data of a point image. Also, the rings are
very sensitive to the FOV size. The u-v coverage of EHT lack about 40
micro-asec fringe spacings. Combining with a very narrow FOV, it created the 40
micro-asec ring structure. We conclude that the absence of the jet and the
presence of the ring in the EHTC result are both artifacts owing to the narrow
FOV setting and the u-v data sampling bias effect of the EHT array. Because the
EHTC's simulations only take into account the reproduction of the input image
models, and not those of the input noise models, their optimal parameters can
enhance the effects of sampling bias and produce artifacts such as the 40
micro-asec ring structure, rather than reproducing the correct image.

Abstract:  We study the spectral evolution of the black hole candidate EXO 1846$-$031
during its 2019 outburst, in the 1--150 keV band,with the {\it {Hard X-ray
Modulation Telescope}}. The continuum spectrum is well modelled with an
absorbed disk-blackbody plus cutoff power-law, in the hard, intermediate and
soft states. In addition, we detect an $\approx$6.6 keV Fe emission line in the
hard intermediate state. Throughout the soft intermediate and soft states, the
fitted inner disk radius remains almost constant; we suggest that it has
settled at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). However, in the hard and
hard intermediate states, the apparent inner radius was unphysically small
(smaller than ISCO), even after accounting for the Compton scattering of some
of the disk photons by the corona in the fit. We argue that this is the result
of a high hardening factor, $f_{\rm col}\approx2.0-2.7$, in the early phases of
outburst evolution, well above the canonical value of 1.7 suitable to a steady
disk. We suggest that the inner disk radius was close to ISCO already in the
low/hard state. Furthermore, we propose that this high value of hardening
factor in the relatively hard state is probably caused by the additional
illuminating of the coronal irradiation onto the disk. Additionally, we
estimate the spin parameter with the continuum-fitting method, over a range of
plausible black hole masses and distances. We compare our results with the spin
measured with the reflection-fitting method and find that the inconsistency of
the two results is partly caused by the different choices of $f_{\rm col}$.

Abstract:  We investigate the contribution of extended radio sources such as Centaurus
A, and Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) to our ability to detect the
statistical $21\,\rm{cm}$ signal from the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) with the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). These sources are typically ignored because
they are in highly attenuated parts of the MWA primary beam, however in
aggregate these sources have apparent flux densities of $10\,\rm{Jy}$ on
angular scales we expect to detect the $21\,\rm{cm}$ signal. We create bespoke
multi-component 2D Gaussian models for Galactic SNRs and for Centaurus A, and
simulate the visibilities for two MWA snapshot observations. We grid those
visibilities and then Fourier transform them with respect to frequency,
averaging them both spherically and cylindrically to produce the 1D and 2D
power spectra. We compare the simulated 1D power spectra to the expected
$21\,\rm{cm}$ power spectrum. We find that although these extended sources are
in highly attenuated parts of the MWA primary beam pattern, collectively they
have enough power ($\sim10^4-10^5\,\rm{mK^2}\,\it{h^{-3}} \,\rm{Mpc^{3}}$) on
EoR significant modes ($|\mathbf{k}| \leq 0.1 h \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$) to prohibit
detection of the $21\,\rm{cm}$ signal ($10^4\,\rm{mK^2}\,\it{h^{-3}}
\,\rm{Mpc^{3}}$). We find that $50-90\%$ of sources must be removed in order to
reduce leakage to a level of $10-20\%$ of the $21\,\rm{cm}$ power spectrum on
EoR significant modes. The effects of widefield extended sources will have
implications on the detectability of the $21\,\rm{cm}$ signal for the MWA and
with the future Square Kilometre Array (SKA).

linear perturbations, though no extra scalar mode is propagating. Using the
Boltzmann code modified to incorporate the present model, we derive the
constraints $-0.047 < \beta < -0.028$ at 68$\%$ confidence from Planck CMB
data. Since our modified gravity model can hardly be constrained by the Solar
System tests and gravitational-wave propagation, our result offers the first

trajectory identified is inferior to previous finds in terms of higher $\Delta
V$ requirement (15.6 $kms^{-1}$), longer flight duration (29 years) and less
mission preparation time (launch 2026), however it benefits from a feature
absent from previous JOM candidates, in that there is little or no $\Delta V$
en route to Jupiter (i.e. a free ride) which means the spacecraft need not
carry a liquid propellant stage. This is marginally offset by the higher
$\Delta V$ needed at Jupiter, requiring either 2 or 3 staged solid rocket
motors. As an example, a Falcon Heavy Expendable with a CASTOR 30B booster
followed by a STAR 48B can deliver 102kg to 1I/'Oumuamua by the year 2059.
Other scenarios with shorter flight durations and higher payload masses are
possible.

Title:Time Dependent Photoionization Modeling of Warm Absorbers in Active Galactic Nuclei,"
Abstract:  Warm absorber spectra contain bound-bound and bound-free absorption features
seen in the X-ray and UV spectra from many active galactic nuclei (AGN). The
widths and centroid energies of these features indicate they occur in
outflowing gas, and the outflow can affect the gas within the host galaxy. Thus
the warm absorber mass and energy budgets are of great interest. Estimates for
these properties depend on models which connect the observed strengths of the
absorption features with the density, composition, and ionization state of the
absorbing gas. Such models assume that the ionization and heating of the gas
come primarily from the strong continuum near the central black hole. They also
assume that the various heating, cooling, ionization, and recombination
processes are in a time-steady balance. This assumption may not be valid, owing
to the intrinsic time-variability of the illuminating continuum, or other
factors which change the cloud environment. This paper presents models for warm
absorbers which follow the time dependence of the ionization, temperature, and
radiation field in warm absorber gas clouds in response to a changing continuum
illumination. We show that the effects of time variability are important over a
range of parameter values, that time dependent models differ from equilibrium
models in important ways, and that these effects should be included in models
which derive properties of warm absorber outflows.

Title:Multi-frequency Variability Study of Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasar PKS 0346-27,"
Abstract:  We have presented a multiwavelength temporal and spectral study of the Blazar
PKS 0346-27 between the time period 2019 January-2021 December (MJD
58484-59575). We analysed the data collected by Fermi-LAT (gamma-rays),
Swift-XRT (x-rays) and Swift-UVOT (ultra-violet). Flaring episodes are
identified by analysing the gamma-ray lightcurve. Flares are fitted using
polynomial fit. We have found rapid variability on time scales of hours during
brightest flaring activity, which implies that the emission region is very
compact. The broadband emission mechanism was studied by modelling the
simultaneous multi waveband Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) using leptonic
emission mechanism. We found that the optical-UV and X-ray data can be
explained by the synchrotron emission. However, the high energy peak is best
fitted with external Compton of disk photon rather than the BLR or DT. Our
modeling also suggest that the flare 1 and flare 5 have more jet power than
flare 2 and 3 which can be caused by different processes. It also suggest that
all the flares are produced in different situation. An auto correlation of
gamma-ray lightcure was done and concluded the possibility of the source being
gravitationally lensed. We have also produced the power spectral density for
this source and a powerlaw seems to produce the best fit with slope 2.15+/-0.87
suggesting variability in this source is dominated by stochastic process. This
source could be a promising target for upcoming CTA for its harder spectrum at
lower energies (tens of GeV).

Title:Cloudlet Capture Model for Asymmetric Molecular Emission Lines Observed in TMC-1A with ALMA,"
Abstract:  TMC-1A is a protostellar source harboring a young protostar, IRAS 04365+2353,
and shows a highly asymmetric features of a few 100 au scale in the molecular
emission lines. Blue-shifted emission is much stronger in the CS ($J=5$-4) line
than red-shifted one. The asymmetry can be explained if the gas accretion is
episodic and takes the form of cloudlet capture, given the cloudlet approached
toward us. The gravity of the protostar transforms the cloudlet into a stream
and changes its velocity along the flow. The emission from the cloudlet should
be blue-shifted before the periastron, while it should be red-shifted after the
periastron. If a major part of cloudlet has not reached the periastron, the
former should be dominant. We perform hydrodynamical simulations to examine the
validity of the scenario. Our numerical simulations can reproduce the observed
asymmetry if the orbit of the cloudlet is inclined to the disk plane. The
inclination can explain the slow infall velocity observed in the C$^{18}$O
($J$=2-1) line emission. Such episodic accretion may occur in various
protostellar cores since actual clouds could have inhomogeneous density
distribution. We also discuss the implication of the cloudlet capture on
observations of related objects.

Title:X-ray Studies of the Inverted Ejecta Layers in the Southeast Area of Cassiopeia A,"
Abstract:  The central strong activities in core-collapse supernovae expect to produce
the overturning of the Fe- and Si/O-rich ejecta during the supernova explosion
based on multi-dimensional simulations. X-ray observations of the supernova
remnant Cassiopeia A have indicated that the Fe-rich ejecta lies outside the
Si-rich materials in the southeastern region, which is consistent with the
hypothesis on the inversion of the ejecta. We investigate the kinematic and
nucleosynthetic properties of the inverted ejecta layers in detail to
understand its formation process using the data taken by the Chandra X-ray
Observatory. Three-dimensional velocities of Fe- and Si/O-rich ejecta are
obtained as $>$4,500 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$2,000--3,000 km s$^{-1}$,
respectively, by combining proper motion and line-of-sight velocities,
indicating that the velocity of the Si/O-rich ejecta is slower than that of the
Fe-rich ejecta since the early stage of the explosion. To constrain their
burning regime, the Cr/Fe mass ratios are evaluated as $0.51_{-0.10}^{+0.11}$%
in the outermost Fe-rich region and $1.24 ^{+0.19}_{-0.20}$% in the inner
Fe/Si-rich region, suggesting that the complete Si burning layer is invertedly
located to the incomplete Si burning layer. All the results support the ejecta
overturning at the early stages of the remnant's evolution or during the
supernova explosion of Cassiopeia A.

Title:Characterization of Kepler targets based on medium-resolution LAMOST spectra analyzed with ROTFIT,"
Abstract:  In this work we present the results of our analysis of 16,300
medium-resolution LAMOST spectra of late-type stars in the Kepler field with
the aim of determining the stellar parameters, activity level, lithium
atmospheric content, and binarity. We have used a version of the code ROTFIT
specifically developed for these spectra. We provide a catalog with the
atmospheric parameters (Teff, log(g), and [Fe/H]), radial velocity (RV), and
projected rotation velocity (vsini). For cool stars (Teff < 6500 K), we also
calculated the H-alpha and LiI-6708 equivalent width, which are important
indicators of chromospheric activity and evolutionary stage, respectively. We
have derived the RV and atmospheric parameters for 14,300 spectra of 7443
stars. Literature data were used for a quality control of the results. The Teff
and log(g) values are in good agreement with the literature. The [Fe/H] values
appear to be overestimated for metal-poor stars. We propose a relation to
correct the [Fe/H] values derived with ROTFIT. We were able to identify
double-lined binaries, stars with variable RVs, lithium-rich giants, and
emission-line objects. Based on the H-alpha flux, we found 327 active stars. We
detected the LiI-6708 line and measure its equivalent width for 1657 stars,
both giants and stars on the main sequence. Regarding the latter, we performed
a discrete age classification based on the atmospheric lithium abundance and
the upper envelopes of a few open clusters. Among the giants, we found 195
Li-rich stars, 161 of which are reported here for the first time. No
relationship is found between stellar rotation and lithium abundance, which
allows us to rule out merger scenarios as the predominant explanation of the
enrichment of Li in our sample. The fraction of Li-rich giants, about 4%, is
higher than expected.

Title:The coupling of an EUV coronal wave and ion acceleration in a Fermi-LAT behind-the-limb solar flare,"
Abstract:  We present the Fermi-LAT observations of the behind-the-limb (BTL) flare of
July 17, 2021 and the joint detection of this flare by STIX onboard Solar
Orbiter. The separation between Earth and the Solar Orbiter was 99.2$^{\circ}$
at 05:00 UT, allowing STIX to have a front view of the flare. The location of
the flare was ~S20E140 in Stonyhurst heliographic coordinates making this the
most distant behind-the-limb flare ever detected in $>$100 MeV gamma-rays. The
LAT detection lasted for $\sim$16 minutes, the peak flux was $ 3.6 \pm 0.8 $
(10$^{-5}$) ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ with a significance $>$15$\sigma$. A coronal
wave was observed from both STEREO-A and SDO in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) with
an onset on the visible disk in coincidence with the LAT onset. A complex type
II radio burst was observed by GLOSS also in coincidence with the onset of the
LAT emission indicating the presence of a shock wave. We discuss the relation
between the time derivative of the EUV wave intensity profile at 193\angstrom\
as observed by STEREO-A and the LAT flux to show that the appearance of the
coronal wave at the visible disk and the acceleration of protons as traced by
the observed $>$100 MeV gamma-ray emission are coupled. We also report how this
coupling is present in the data from 3 other BTL flares detected by Fermi-LAT
suggesting that the protons driving the gamma-ray emission of BTL solar flares
and the coronal wave share a common origin.

Title:Polarimetric investigation of selected cloud compositions in exoplanetary atmospheres,"
Abstract:  We investigated the impact of selected cloud condensates in exoplanetary
atmospheres on the polarization of scattered stellar radiation. We considered a
selection of 25 cloud condensates that are expected to be present in extrasolar
planetary atmospheres. Using the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative
transfer code POLARIS and assuming Mie scattering theory, we calculated and
studied the net polarization of scattered radiation as a function of planetary
phase angle at optical to near-infrared wavelengths. In addition to the
well-known characteristics in the state of polarization, such as the rainbow
determined by the real part of the refractive index, the behavior of the
underlying imaginary part of the refractive index causes an increase or
decrease in the degree of polarization and a change of sign in the polarization
at a characteristic wavelength. In contrast to Al$_2$O$_3$ and MgFeSiO$_4$,
clouds composed of SiO, MnS, Na$_2$S, or ZnS produce a rapidly decreasing
degree of polarization with increasing wavelength in the context of an
exoplanetary atmosphere. Furthermore, the sign of the polarization changes at a
wavelength of about 0.5 $\mu$m to 0.6 $\mu$m, depending on the specific cloud
condensate. The resulting net polarization is mainly positive for cloud
compositions with large imaginary parts of the refractive index, such as Fe,
FeS, and FeO. In addition, for Fe and FeS clouds, the maximum degree of
polarization at long wavelengths is shifted to larger phase angles than for
FeO. We found that most of these cloud condensates are distinguishable from
each other due to their unique wavelength-dependent complex refractive index.
In particular, an increase or decrease of the net polarization as a function of
wavelength and a change of sign in the polarization at specific wavelengths are
important features for characterizing cloud compositions in exoplanetary
atmospheres.

Title:Modelling O-star astrospheres with different relative speeds between the ISM and the star: 2D and 3D MHD model comparison,"
Abstract:  Context. State of the art simulations of astrospheres are modelled using
three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). An astrospheric interaction
of a stellar wind (SW) with its surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) can only
generate a bow shock if the speed of the interstellar inflow is higher than the
fast magnetosonic speed. Aims. The differences of astrospheres at differing
speeds of the ISM inflow are investigated, and the necessity of the third
dimension in modelling is evaluated. Methods. The model astrosphere of the
runaway O-star $\lambda$ Cephei is computed in both two- and three-dimensional
MHD at four different ISM inflow speeds, one of which is barely faster
(superfast) and one of which is slower (subfast) than the fast magnetosonic
speed. Results. The two-dimensional (2D) and 3D models of astrospheres with ISM
inflow speeds considerably higher than the fast magnetosonic speed are in good
agreement. However, in 2D models, where no realistic SW magnetic field can be
modelled, the downwind structures of the astrospheres vacillate. Models where
hydrodynamic effects are not clearly dominant over the magnetic field show
asymmetries, thus necessitating a 3D approach. The physical times of
simulations of astrospheres with slow ISM inflows can swiftly exceed the
lifetime of the corresponding star. A hitherto unobserved structure has been
found downwind of the astrotail in the subfast 3D model.

Title:Analytic model for photometric variation due to starspots on a differentially rotating star,"
Abstract:  We present an analytic model of the lightcurve variation for stars with
non-evolving starspots on a differentially rotating surface. The Fourier
coefficients of the harmonics of the rotation period are expressed in terms of
the latitude of the spot, $\ell_{s}$, and the observer's line-of-sight
direction, $\ell_{o}$, including the limb darkening effect. We generate
different realizations of multi-spots according to the model, and perform mock
observations of the resulting lightcurve modulations. We discuss to what extent
one can recover the properties of the spots and the parameters for the
differential rotation law from the periodogram analysis. Although our
analytical model neglects the evolution of spots on the stellar surface
(dynamical motion, creation and annihilation), it provides a basic framework to
interpret the photometric variation of stars, in particular from the existing
Kepler data and the future space-born mission. It is also applicable to
photometric modulations induced by rotation of various astronomical objects.

Title:Fine and hyperfine excitation of nitric oxide by collision with para-H2,"
Abstract:  Nitric oxide is an open-shell molecule abundantly detected in the
interstellar medium. A precise modeling of its radiative and collisional
processes opens the path to a precise estimate of its abundance. We present
here the first rate coefficients for fine and hyperfine (de-)excitation of NO
by collisions with the most ubiquitous collision partner in the interstellar
medium, $para$-H$_2$ hydrogen molecules, using a recently developed accurate
interaction potential. We report quantum scattering calculations for
transitions involving the first 74 fine levels and the corresponding 442
hyperfine levels belonging to both $F_1$ and $F_2$ spin-orbit manifolds. To do
so, we have calculated cross sections by means of the quantum mechanical
close-coupling approach up to 1000 cm$^{-1}$ of total energy and rate
coefficients from 5 to 100 K. Propensity rules are discussed and the new
NO-H$_2$ rates are compared to those available in the literature, based on
scaled NO-He rates. Large differences are observed between the two sets of rate
coefficients, and this comparison shows that the new collision rates must be
used in interpreting NO emission lines. We also examined the effect of these
new rates on the NO excitation in cold clouds by performing radiative transfer
calculations of the excitation and brightness temperatures for the two NO lines
at 150.176 and 250.4368 GHz. This shows that the local thermodynamic
equilibrium is not fulfilled for this species for typical conditions. We expect
the use of the rates presented in this study to improve the constraints on the
abundance of NO.

Title:A dearth of close-in planets around rapidly rotating stars or a dearth of data?,"
Abstract:  A dearth of close-in planets orbiting rapid rotators was reported almost a
decade ago. According to this view only slowly spinning stars with rotation
periods longer than 5-10 days would host planets with orbital periods shorter
than 2 or 3 days. This Letter brings an enlarged and more detailed analysis
that led us to the question: Is there really a dearth in that distribution or
is it a dearth of data? For this new analysis, we combined different samples of
Kepler and TESS stars with confirmed planets or planet candidates with measured
stellar rotation periods, using Gaia data to perform an in-depth selection of
1013 planet-hosting main-sequence stars. With the newer, enlarged, and more
refined data, the reported dearth of close-in planets orbiting rapid rotators
tends to disappear, thus suggesting that it may reflect a scarcity of data in
the prior analysis. A two sample statistical test strongly supports our
results, showing that the distribution of close-in planets orbiting rapid
rotators is almost indistinguishable from that for close-in planets orbiting
slow rotators.

Title:Modeling Electron Acceleration and Transport in the Early Impulsive Phase of the 2017 September 10 Solar Flare,"
Abstract:  The X8.2-class limb flare on September 10, 2017 is among the best studied
solar flare events owing to its great similarity to the standard flare model
and the broad coverage by multiple spacecraft and ground-based observations.
These multiwavelength observations indicate that electron acceleration and
transport are efficient in the reconnection and flare looptop regions. However,
there lacks a comprehensive model for explaining and interpreting the
multi-faceted observations. In this work, we model the electron acceleration
and transport in the early impulsive phase of this flare. We solve the Parker
transport equation that includes the primary acceleration mechanism during
magnetic reconnection in the large-scale flare region modeled by MHD
simulations. We find that electrons are accelerated up to several MeV and fill
a large volume of the reconnection region, similar to the observations shown in
microwaves. The electron spatial distribution and spectral shape in the looptop
region agree well with those derived from the microwave and hard X-ray
emissions before magnetic islands grow large and dominate the acceleration.
Future emission modelings using the electron maps will enable direct comparison
with microwave and hard X-ray observations. These results shed new light on the
electron acceleration and transport in a broad region of solar flares within a
data-constrained realistic flare geometry.

Abstract:  In this work, we study the magnetic field morphology of selected star-forming
clouds spread over the galactic latitude ($b$) range, $-10^\circ$ to
$10^\circ$. The polarimetric observation of clouds CB24, CB27 and CB188 are
conducted to study the magnetic field geometry of those clouds from ARIES,
Manora Peak, Nainital, India. These observations are combined with those of 14
further low latitude clouds available in the literature. Analyzing the
polarimetric data of 17 clouds, we find that the alignment between the envelope
magnetic field ($\theta_{B}^{env}$) and Galactic plane ($\theta_{GP}$) of the
low-latitude clouds varies with their galactic longitudes ($l$). We observe a
strong correlation between the longitude (\textit{l}) and the offset
($\theta_{off}=|\theta_B^{env}-\theta_{GP}|$) which shows that
$\theta_{B}^{env}$ is parallel to the Galactic plane (GP) when the clouds are
situated in the region, $115^\circ<l<250^\circ$. However, $\theta_{B}^{env}$
has its own local deflection irrespective of the orientation of $\theta_{GP}$
when the clouds are at $l<100^\circ$ and $l>250^\circ$. To check the
consistency of our results, the stellar polarization data available at Heiles
(2000) catalogue are overlaid on DSS image of the clouds having mean
polarization vector of field stars. The results are almost consistent with the
Heiles data. The effect of turbulence of the cloud is also studied which may
play an important role in causing the misalignment phenomenon observed between
$\theta_{B}^{env}$ and $\theta_{GP}$. We have used \textit{Herschel}
\textit{SPIRE} 500 $\mu m$ and \textit{SCUBA} 850 $\mu m$ dust continuum
emission maps in our work to understand the density structure of the clouds.

Title:Constraining ultralight bosonic dark matter with Keck observations of S2's orbit and kinematics,"
Abstract:  Ultralight scalar dark matter is expected to be able to form a cloud
surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic center. With
increasing precision of the observations of the stellar kinematics around the
SMBH, tiny effects from such a dark matter cloud, including its gravitational
perturbation and the direct coupling with ordinary matter may be detectable. In
this work, we search for possible evidence of the scalar cloud using accurate
orbital measurements of the S2 star around Sgr A*. We solve the first order
Post-Newtonian equation, considering simultaneously the extended mass
distribution of the scalar cloud and the additional coupling via Higgs-portal
or photon-portal interaction. We find that the astrometric and spectroscopic
data of the S2 star are well consistent with the scenario of point-like mass of
Sgr A*. We thus derive upper limits of the extended mass and the coupling of
the new interaction. The limits of the Higgs coupling and extended mass of the
scalar cloud are the most stringent ones for the scalar mass window between
$3.2\times 10^{-19}$ eV and $1.6\times 10^{-18}$ eV.

Title:On the stellar core physics of the 16 Cyg binary system: constraining the central hydrogen abundance using asteroseismology,"
Abstract:  The unprecedented quality of the asteroseismic data of solar-type stars made
available by space missions such as NASA's Kepler telescope are making it
possible to explore stellar interior structures. This offers possibilities of
constraining stellar core properties (such as core sizes, abundances, and
physics) paving the way for improving the precision of the inferred stellar
ages. We employ 16 Cyg A and B as our benchmark stars for an asteroseismic
study in which we present a novel approach aimed at selecting from a sample of
acceptable stellar models returned from Forward Modelling techniques, down to
the ones that better represent the core of each star. This is accomplished by
comparing specific properties of the observed frequency ratios for each star to
the ones derived from the acceptable stellar models. We demonstrate that in
this way we are able to constrain further the hydrogen mass fraction in the
core, establishing the stars' precise evolutionary states and ages. The ranges
of the derived core hydrogen mass fractions are [0.01 - 0.06] and [0.12 - 0.19]
for 16 Cyg A and B, respectively, and, considering that the stars are coeval,
the age and metal mass fraction parameters span the region [6.4 - 7.4] Gyr and
[0.023 - 0.026], respectively. In addition, our findings show that using a
single helium-to-heavy element enrichment ratio, ($\Delta Y/\Delta Z$), when
forward modelling the 16 Cyg binary system, may result in a sample of
acceptable models that do not simultaneously fit the observed frequency ratios,
further highlighting that such an approach to the definition of the helium
content of the star may not be adequate in studies of individual stars.

27-28, when a forest of hundreds of X-ray bursts and a large enhancement of the
persistent flux were detected. For the first time, a radio burst with
properties similar to those of fast radio bursts and with a X-ray counterpart
was observed from this source, showing that magnetars can power at least a
group of fast radio bursts. In this paper, we report on the X-ray spectral and
timing properties of SGR J1935+2154 based on a long-term monitoring campaign
with Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Swift and NICER covering a time span of ~7
months since the outburst onset. The broadband spectrum exhibited a non-thermal
power-law component (photon index~1.2) extending up to ~20-25 keV throughout
the campaign and a blackbody component with temperature decreasing from ~1.5
keV at the outburst peak to ~0.45 keV in the following months. We found that
the luminosity decay is well described by the sum of two exponential functions,
reflecting the fast decay (~1 d) at the early stage of the outburst followed by
a slower decrease (~30 d). The source reached quiescence about ~80 days after
the outburst onset, releasing an energy of ~6e40 erg during the outburst. We
detected X-ray pulsations in the XMM-Newton data sets and derived an average
spin-down rate of ~3.5e-11 s/s using the spin period measurements derived in

Moreover, we report on simultaneous radio observations performed with the

orbits was conducted using ARCcode with relativistic corrections
(post-Newtonian) up to the 2.5$^{th}$ order. Pythagorean triangles with with
different linear scales were selected where the largest black hole in these
systems were given spin vectors in normalised units where maximum is close to
unity, ranging from 0 to about 0.95. We also study different masses in scales
ranging from 10$^{0}$ M$_{\odot}$ - 10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. It was found that
while there was no distinctive effect on the number of two-body encounters nor
the fraction of mergers, the lifetimes of the systems may have been affected -
particularly in the intermediary mass ranges (10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$-10$^{7}$
M$_{\odot}$) in comparison to the zero spin problem. Differences were also
found between configurations considered more hierarchical and those of lesser
hierarchy. Triple systems ended up moving from the two-dimensional planar
problem to the three dimensional one where we see increased motion in the
z-axis with increasing spin magnitude for the large mass systems. The argument
of periapsis, $\omega$, and the longitude of ascending node, $\Omega$ between
the rotating black hole and a non-rotating one within the system, were also
affected by the added spin.

Title:A minute-long merger-driven gamma-ray burst from fast-cooling synchrotron emission,"
Abstract:  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are intense episodes of high-energy emission seen
isotropically across the sky and all through cosmic time. For decades, they
have been broadly divided into `long'- and `short'-duration bursts, lasting
more or less than 2s, respectively, but it has been apparent for several years
that this dichotomy is imperfect. The split does not map directly to the two
progenitor channels that are known to produce GRBs -- the merger of compact
objects (merger-GRBs) or the collapse of massive stars (collapsar-GRBs). In
particular, the merger population (typically short-duration) also includes
bursts with a short, hard $<$2s spike and subsequent longer, softer extended
emission (EE). There have also been examples of apparent short bursts in which
supernova detections indicate a collapsar origin. The recent discovery of a
kilonova -- the radioactive glow of heavy elements made in neutron star mergers
-- in the 50s-duration GRB 211211A further complicates this picture,
demonstrating that mergers can drive GRBs with complex and long-lived light
curves whose broad spectral and temporal properties are consistent with the
collapsar population. Here we present detailed analysis of the high energy
emission associated with GRB 211211A. We demonstrate that the rapidly-evolving
spectrum can be fit by purely synchrotron emission with both the peak and
cooling frequencies moving through the $\gamma$-ray band, down to the X-rays.
This is the first time that such spectral evolution has been demonstrated in a
merger-GRB, and we show that it drives the extended emission signature at late

suggests that GRB 211211A may provide a unifying blueprint for identifying
long-duration GRBs from mergers, potentially paving the way for strong
diagnostics of the progenitor type.

Title:What determines active region coronal plasma composition?,"
Abstract:  The chemical composition of the solar corona is different from that of the
solar photosphere, with the strongest variation being observed in active
regions (ARs). Using data from the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode, we present a survey of coronal elemental
composition as expressed in the first ionisation potential (FIP) bias in 28 ARs
of different ages and magnetic flux content, which are at different stages in
their evolution. We find no correlation between the FIP bias of an AR and its
total unsigned magnetic flux or age. However, there is a weak dependence of FIP
bias on the evolutionary stage, decreasing from 1.9-2.2 in ARs with spots to
1.5-1.6 in ARs that are at more advanced stages of the decay phase. FIP bias
shows an increasing trend with average magnetic flux density up to 200 G but
this trend does not continue at higher values. The FIP bias distribution within
ARs has a spread between 0.4 and 1. The largest spread is observed in very
dispersed ARs. We attribute this to a range of physical processes taking place
in these ARs including processes associated with filament channel formation.
These findings indicate that, while some general trends can be observed, the
processes influencing the composition of an AR are complex and specific to its
evolution, magnetic configuration or environment. The spread of FIP bias values
in ARs shows a broad match with that previously observed in situ in the slow
solar wind.

Title:GRB 211211A: a Prolonged Central Engine under a Strong Magnetic Field Environment,"
Abstract:  Recently, a kilonova-associated gamma-ray burst (GRB 211211A), whose light
curve consists of a precursor ($\sim$0.2 s), a hard spiky emission ($\sim$10
s), and a soft long extended emission ($\sim$40 s), has attracted great
attention. Kilonova association could prove its merger origin, while the
detection of the precursor can be used to infer at least one highly magnetized
neutron star (NS) being involved in the merger. In this case, a strong magnetic
flux $\Phi$ is expected to surround the central engine of GRB 211211A. Here we
suggest that when $\Phi$ is large enough, the accretion flow could be halted
far from the innermost stable radius, which will significantly prolong the
lifetime of the accretion process, and so the GRB duration. For example, we
show that as long as the central black hole (BH) is surrounded by a strong
magnetic flux $\Phi\sim 10^{29}\rm cm^{2}G$, an accretion flow with
$\dot{M}_{\rm ini} \simeq 0.1 M_\odot s^{-1}$ could be halted at 40 times the
gravitational radius and be slowly transferred into the black hole on the order
of $\sim$10 s, which naturally explains the duration of hard spiky emission.
After most of the disk mass has been accreted onto the BH, the inflow rate will
be reduced, so a long and soft extended emission is expected when a new balance
between the magnetic field and the accretion current is reconstructed at a
larger radius. Our results further support that the special behavior of GRB
211211A is mainly due to the strong magnetic field of its progenitor stars.

Title:A spectroscopic quadruple as a possible progenitor of sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae,"
Abstract:  Binaries have received much attention as possible progenitors of Type Ia
supernova (SNIa) explosions, but long-term gravitational effects in tight
triple or quadruple systems could also play a key role in producing SNIa. Here
we report on the properties of a spectroscopic quadruple (SB4) found within a
star cluster: the 2+2 hierarchical system HD 74438. Its membership in the open
cluster IC 2391 makes it the youngest (43 My) SB4 discovered so far and among
the quadruple systems with the shortest outer orbital period. The eccentricity
of the 6 y outer period is 0.46 and the two inner orbits, with periods of 20.5
d and 4.4 d, and eccentricities of 0.36 and 0.15, are not coplanar. Using an
innovative combination of ground-based high resolution spectroscopy and
Gaia/Hipparcos astrometry, we show that this system is undergoing secular
interaction that likely pumped the eccentricity of one of the inner orbits
higher than expected for the spectral types of its components. We compute the
future evolution of HD 74438 and show that this system is an excellent
candidate progenitor of sub-Chandrasekhar SNIa through white dwarf (WD)
mergers. Taking into account the contribution of this specific type of SNIa
better accounts for the chemical evolution of iron-peak elements in the Galaxy
than considering only near Chandrasekhar-mass SNIa.

Title:Faint light of old neutron stars from dark matter capture and detectability at the James Webb Space Telescope,"
Abstract:  Neutron stars (NS) of age $>10^9$ yrs exhaust thermal and rotational energies
and cool down to temperatures below $\mathcal{O}(100)$ K. Accretion of particle
dark matter (DM) by such NS can heat them up through kinetic and annihilation
processes. This increases the NS surface temperature to a maximum of $\sim
2600$ K in the best case scenario. The maximum accretion rate depends on the DM
ambient density and velocity dispersion, and on the NS equation of state and
their velocity distributions. Upon scanning over these variables, we find that
the effective surface temperature varies at most by $\sim 40\%$. Black body
spectrum of such warm NS peak at near infrared wavelengths with magnitudes in
the range potentially detectable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
Using the JWST exposure time calculator, we demonstrate that NS with surface
temperatures $\gtrsim 2400$ K, located at a distance of 10 pc can be detected
through the F150W2 (F322W2) filters of the NIRCAM instrument at SNR $\gtrsim
10$ (5) within 24 hours of exposure time.

"Title:Two-fluid implementation in MPI-AMRVAC, with applications in the solar chromosphere","
Abstract:  The chromosphere is a partially ionized layer of the solar atmosphere, the
transition between the photosphere where the gas is almost neutral and the
fully ionized corona. As the collisional coupling between neutral and charged
particles decreases in the upper part of the chromosphere, the hydrodynamical
timescales may become comparable to the collisional timescale, and a two-fluid
model is needed. In this paper we describe the implementation and validation of
a two-fluid model which simultaneously evolves charges and neutrals, coupled by
collisions. The two-fluid equations are implemented in the fully open-source
MPI-AMRVAC code. In the photosphere and the lower part of the solar atmosphere,
where collisions between charged and neutral particles are very frequent, an
explicit time-marching would be too restrictive, since for stability the
timestep needs to be proportional to the inverse of the collision frequency.
This is overcome by evaluating the collisional terms implicitly using an
explicit-implicit (IMEX) scheme. The cases presented cover very different
collisional regimes and our results are fully consistent with related
literature findings. If collisional time and length scales are smaller than the
hydrodynamical scales usually considered in the solar chromosphere, density
structures seen in the neutral and charged fluids are similar, with the effect
of elastic collisions between charges and neutrals being similar to
diffusivity. Otherwise, density structures are different and the decoupling in
velocity between the two species increases. The use of IMEX schemes efficiently
avoids the small timestep constraints of fully explicit implementations in
strongly collisional regimes. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) greatly decreases
the computational cost, compared to uniform grid runs at the same effective
resolution.

Title:The Ariel Target List: The Impact of TESS and the Potential for Characterising Multiple Planets Within a System,"
Abstract:  The ESA Ariel mission has been adopted for launch in 2029 and will conduct a
survey of around one thousand exoplanetary atmospheres during its primary
mission life. By providing homogeneous datasets, with a high SNR and wide
wavelength coverage, Ariel will unveil the atmospheric demographics of these
far-away worlds, helping to constrain planet formation and evolution processes
on a galactic scale. Ariel seeks to undertake a statistical survey of a diverse
population of planets and, therefore, the sample of planets from which this
selection can be made is of the utmost importance. While many suitable targets
have already been found, hundreds more will be discovered before the mission is
operational. Previous studies have used predictions of exoplanet detections to
forecast the available planet population by the launch date of Ariel, with the
most recent noting that the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) alone
should provide over a thousand potential targets. In this work, we consider the
planet candidates found to date by TESS to show that, with the addition of
already confirmed planets, Ariel will already have a more than sufficient
sample to choose its target list from once these candidates are validated. We
showcase the breadth of this population as well as exploring, for the first
time, the ability of Ariel to characterise multiple planets within a single
system. Comparative planetology of worlds orbiting the same star, as well as
across the wider population, will undoubtedly revolutionise our understanding
of planet formation and evolution.

Title:A Novel Solution for Resonant Scattering Using Self-Consistent Boundary Conditions,"
Abstract:  We present two novel additions to the semi-analytic solution of Lyman
$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) radiative transfer in spherical geometry: (1)
implementation of the correct boundary condition for a steady source, and (2)
solution of the time-dependent problem for an impulsive source. For the
steady-state problem, the solution can be represented as a sum of two terms: a
previously-known analytic solution of the equation with mean intensity $J=0$ at
the surface, and a novel, semi-analytic solution which enforces the correct
boundary condition of zero-ingoing intensity at the surface. This solution is
compared to that of the Monte Carlo method, which is valid at arbitrary optical
depth. It is shown that the size of the correction is of order unity when the
spectral peaks approach the Doppler core and decreases slowly with line center
optical depth, specifically as $(a \tau_0)^{-1/3}$, which may explain
discrepancies seen in previous studies. For the impulsive problem, the time,
spatial, and frequency dependence of the solution are expressed using an
eigenfunction expansion in order to characterize the escape time distribution
and emergent spectra of photons. It is shown that the lowest-order
eigenfrequency agrees well with the decay rate found in the Monte Carlo escape
time distribution at sufficiently large line-center optical depths. The
characterization of the escape-time distribution highlights the potential for a
Monte Carlo acceleration method, which would sample photon escape properties
from distributions rather than calculating every photon scattering, thereby
reducing computational demand.

Title:Power spectrum of domain-wall network and its implications for isotropic and anisotropic cosmic birefringence,"
Abstract:  Recently, based on a novel analysis of the Planck satellite data, a hint of a
uniform rotation of the polarization of cosmic microwave background photons,
called isotropic cosmic birefringence, has been reported. The suggested
rotation angle of polarization of about $0.2-0.4$ degrees strongly suggests
that it is determined by the fine structure constant, which can be naturally
explained over a very wide parameter range by the domain walls of axion-like
particles. Interestingly, the axion-like particle domain walls predict not only
isotropic cosmic birefringence but also anisotropic one that reflects the
spatial distribution of the axion-like particle field on the last scattering
surface. In this Letter, we perform lattice simulations of the formation and
evolution of domain walls in the expanding universe and obtain for the first
time the two-point correlation function and power spectrum of the scalar field
that constitutes the domain walls. We find that while the power spectrum is
generally consistent with analytical predictions based on random wall
distributions, there is a predominant excess on the scale corresponding to the
Hubble radius. Applying our results to the anisotropic cosmic birefringence, we
predict the power spectrum of the rotation angles induced by the axion-like
particle domain walls and show that it is within the reach of future
observations of the cosmic microwave background.

Title:A Mathematical Treatment of the Offset Microlensing Degeneracy,"
Abstract:  The offset microlensing degeneracy, recently proposed by Zhang et al. (2022),
has been shown to generalize the close-wide and inner-outer caustic
degeneracies into a unified regime of magnification degeneracy in the
interpretation of 2-body planetary microlensing observations. While the
inner-outer degeneracy expects the source trajectory to pass equidistant to the
planetary caustics of the degenerate lens configurations, the offset degeneracy
states that the same mathematical expression applies to any combination of the
close, wide, and resonant caustic topologies, where the projected star-planet
separations differ by an offset ($s_{\rm A}\neq s_{\rm B}$) that depends on
where the source trajectory crosses the star-planet axis. An important
implication is that the $s_{\rm A}=1/s_{\rm B}$ solution of the close-wide
degeneracy never strictly manifests in observations except when the source
crosses a singular point near the primary. Nevertheless, the offset degeneracy
was proposed upon numerical calculations, and no theoretical justification was
given. Here, we provide a theoretical treatment of the offset degeneracy, which
demonstrates its nature as a mathematical degeneracy. From first principles, we
show that the offset degeneracy formalism is exact to zeroth-order in the mass
ratio ($q$) for two cases: when the source crosses the lens-axis inside of
caustics, and for $(s_{\rm A}-s_{\rm B})^6\ll1$ when crossing outside of
caustics. The extent to which the offset degeneracy persists in oblique source
trajectories is explored numerically. Lastly, it is shown that the
superposition principle allows for a straightforward generalization to $N$-body
microlenses with $N-1$ planetary lens components ($q\ll1$), which results in a
$2^{N-1}$-fold degeneracy.

Title:The first hard X-ray spectral catalogue of Blazars observed by NuSTAR,"
Abstract:  Blazars are a peculiar class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that enlighten
the sky at all wavelengths. The electromagnetic emission of these sources is
jet-dominated resulting in a spectral energy distribution (SED) that has a
typical double-humped shape. X-ray photons provide a wealth of information on
the physics of each source as in the X-ray band we can observe the tail of SED
first peak, the rise of the second one or the transition between the two.
NuSTAR, thanks to its capability of focusing X-rays up to 79 keV provides
broadband data particularly suitable to compute SEDs in a still poorly explored
part of the spectrum. In the context of the Open Universe initiative we
developed a dedicated pipeline, NuSTAR_Spectra, a shell-script that
automatically downloads data from the archive, generates scientific products
and carries out a complete spectral analysis. The script homogeneously extracts
high level scientific products for both NuSTAR's telescopes and the spectral
characterisation is performed testing two phenomenological models. The
corresponding X-ray properties are derived from the data best-fit and the SEDs
are also computed. The systematic processing of all blazar observations of the
NuSTAR public archive allowed us to release the first hard X-ray spectroscopic
catalogue of blazars (NuBlazar). The catalogue, updated to September 30th,
2021, includes 253 observations of 126 distinct blazars, 30 of which have been
multiply observed.

Abstract:  We use deep spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
Wide-Field-Camera 3 (WFC3) IR grisms combined with broad-band photometry to
study the stellar populations, gas ionization and chemical abundances in
star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 1.1-2.3$. The data stem from the CANDELS
Lyman-$\alpha$ Emission At Reionization (CLEAR) survey. At these redshifts the
grism spectroscopy measure the [OII] 3727, 3729, [OIII] 4959, 5008, H-$\beta$
strong emission features, which constrain the ionization parameter and oxygen
abundance of the nebular gas. We compare the line flux measurements to
predictions from updated photoionization models (MAPPINGS (Kewley et al. 2019),
which include an updated treatment of nebular gas pressure, log P/k = $n_e
T_e$. Compared to low-redshift samples ($z\sim 0.2$) at fixed stellar mass,
llog M / M$_\odot$ = 9.4-9.8, the CLEAR galaxies at z=1.35 (z=1.90) have lower
gas-phase metallicity, $\Delta$(log Z) = 0.25 (0.35) dex, and higher ionization
parameters, $\Delta$(log q) = 0.25 (0.35) dex, where U = q/c. We provide
updated analytic calibrations between the [OIII], [OII], and H-$\beta$ emission
line ratios, metallicity, and ionization parameter. The CLEAR galaxies show
that at fixed stellar mass, the gas ionization parameter is correlated with the
galaxy specific star-formation rates (sSFRs), where $\Delta$ log q = 0.4
$\Delta$(log sSFR), derived from changes in the strength of galaxy H-$\beta$
equivalent width. We interpret this as a consequence of higher gas densities,
lower gas covering fractions, combined with higher escape fraction of
H-ionizing photons. We discuss both tests to confirm these assertions and
implications this has for future observations of galaxies at higher redshifts.

of both tidal disruption events (TDEs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and
its nature is not fully understood. We present detailed X-ray observations of
AT2019pev taken with Swift, Chandra and NICER over 173 days of its evolution
since the first Swift XRT epoch. The X-ray luminosity increases by a factor of
five in five days from the first Swift XRT epoch to the lightcurve peak. The
lightcurve decays by a factor of ten over $\sim$75 days and then flattens with
a weak re-brightening trend at late times. The X-ray spectra show a
""harder-when-brighter"" trend before peak and a ""harder-when-fainter"" trend
after peak, which may indicate a transition of accretion states. The archival
ground-based optical observations show similar time evolution as the X-ray
lightcurves. Beyond the seasonal limit of the ground-based observations, the
Gaia lightcurve is rising toward an equally bright or brighter peak 223 days
after the optical discovery. Combining our X-ray analysis and archival
multi-wavelength data, AT2019pev more closely resembles an AGN transient.

Title:Modelling the host galaxies of binary compact object mergers with observational scaling relations,"
Abstract:  The merger rate density evolution of binary compact objects and the
properties of their host galaxies carry crucial information to understand the
sources of gravitational waves. Here, we present galaxyRate, a new code that
estimates the merger rate density of binary compact objects and the properties
of their host galaxies, based on observational scaling relations. We generate
our synthetic galaxies according to the galaxy stellar mass function. We
estimate the metallicity according to both the mass-metallicity relation (MZR)
and the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). Also, we take into account
galaxy-galaxy mergers and the evolution of the galaxy properties from the
formation to the merger of the binary compact object. We find that the merger
rate density changes dramatically depending on the choice of the star-forming
galaxy main sequence, especially in the case of binary black holes (BBHs) and
black hole neutron star systems (BHNSs). The slope of the merger rate density
of BBHs and BHNSs is steeper if we assume the MZR with respect to the FMR,
because the latter predicts a shallower decrease of metallicity with redshift.
In contrast, binary neutron stars (BNSs) are only mildly affected by both the
galaxy main sequence and metallicity relation. Overall, BBHs and BHNSs tend to
form in low-mass metal-poor galaxies and merge in high-mass metal-rich
galaxies, while BNSs form and merge in massive galaxies. We predict that
passive galaxies host at least ~5-10%, ~15-25%, and ~15-35% of all BNS, BHNS
and BBH mergers in the local Universe.

Abstract:  We probe the environmental properties of X-ray supernova remnants (SNRs) at
various points along their evolutionary journey, especially the S-T phase, and
their conformance with theoretically derived models of SNR evolution. The
remnant size is used as a proxy for the age of the remnant. Our data set
includes 34 Milky Way, 59 Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and 5 Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) SNRs. We select remnants that have been definitively typed as
either core-collapse (CC) or Type Ia supernovae, with well-defined size
estimates, and a thermal X-ray flux measured over the entire remnant. A catalog
of SNR size and X-ray luminosity is presented and plotted, with ambient density
and age estimates from the literature. Model remnants with a given density, in
the Sedov-Taylor (S-T) phase, are overplotted on the diameter-vs-luminosity
plot, allowing the evolutionary state and physical properties of SNRs to be
compared to each other, and to theoretical models. We find that small, young
remnants are predominantly Type Ia remnants or high luminosity CCs, suggesting
that many CC SNRs are not detected until after they have emerged from the
progenitor's wind-blown bubble. An examination of the distribution of SNR
diameters in the Milky Way and LMC reveals that LMC SNRs must be evolving in an
ambient medium which is 30% as dense as that in the Milky Way. This is
consistent with ambient density estimates for the Galaxy and LMC.

Abstract:  The NGC 346 young stellar system and associated N66 giant HII region in the
Small Magellanic Cloud are the nearest example of a massive star forming event
in a low metallicity ($Z\approx0.2Z_{\odot}$) galaxy. With an age of
$\lesssim$3Myr this system provides a unique opportunity to study relationships
between massive stars and their associated HII region. Using archival data, we
derive a total H$\alpha$ luminosity of
L(H$\alpha$)=4.1$\times$10$^{38}$ergs$^{-1}$ corresponding to an
H-photoionization rate of 3$\times$10$^{50}$s$^{-1}$. A comparison with a
predicted stellar ionization rate derived from the more than 50 known O-stars
in NGC 346, including massive stars recently classified from HST FUV spectra,
indicates an approximate ionization balance. Spectra obtained with SALT suggest
the ionization structure of N66 could be consistent with some leakage of
ionizing photons. Due to the low metallicity, the far ultraviolet luminosity
from NGC 346 is not confined to the interstellar cloud associated with N66.
Ionization extends through much of the spatial extent of the N66 cloud complex,
and most of the cloud mass is not ionized. The stellar mass estimated from
nebular L(H$\alpha$) appears to be lower than masses derived from the census of
resolved stars which may indicate a disconnect between the formation of high
and low mass stars in this region. We briefly discuss implications of the
properties of N66 for studies of star formation and stellar feedback in low
metallicity environments.

Title:Probing Red Supergiant dynamics through photo-center displacements measured by Gaia,"
Abstract:  Red supergiant (RSGs) are cool massive stars in a late phase of their
evolution when the stellar envelope becomes fully convective. They are the
brightest stars in the universe at infrared light and can be detected in
galaxies far beyond the Local Group, allowing for accurate determination of
chemical composition of galaxies. The study of their physical properties is
extremely important for various phenomena including the final fate of massive
stars as type II supernovae and gravitational wave progenitors. We explore the
well-studied nearby young stellar cluster chi Per. Using Gaia EDR3 data, we
find the distance of the cluster (d = 2.260+-0.020 kpc). We then investigate
the variability of the convection-related surface structure as a source for
parallax measurement uncertainty. We use state-of-the-art 3D radiative
hydrodynamics simulations with CO5BOLD and the post-processing radiative
transfer code OPTIM3D to compute intensity maps in the Gaia G photometric
system. We calculate the variabiltiy, as a function of time, of the
intensity-weighted mean from the synthetic maps. We then select the RSG stars
in the cluster and compare their uncertainty on parallaxes to the predictions
of photocentre displacements. The synthetic maps of RSG show extremely
irregular and temporal variable surfaces due to convection-related dynamics.
Consequentially, the position of the photo-center varies during Gaia
measurements between 0.033 and 0.130 AU (up to 5% of the corresponding
simulation stellar radius). We argue that the variability of the
convection-related surface structures accounts for a substantial part of the
Gaia EDR3 parallax error of the RSG sample. We suggest that the variation of
the uncertainty on Gaia parallax could be exploited quantitatively using
appropriate 3D simulations to extract, in a unique way, important information
about the stellar dynamics and parameters of RSG stars.

Title:Constraining the Milky Way's Pulsar Population with the Cosmic-Ray Positron Fraction,"
Abstract:  Observations of the TeV halos associated with nearby pulsars indicate that
these objects inject significant fluxes of very high-energy electron-positrons
pairs into the interstellar medium (ISM), thereby likely providing the dominant
contribution to the cosmic-ray positron flux. In this paper, we use the
cosmic-ray positron fraction as measured by the AMS-02 Collaboration to
constrain the characteristics of the local pulsar population. For reasonable
model parameters, we find that we can obtain good agreement with the measured
positron fraction up to energies of $E_e \sim 300 \, {\rm GeV}$. At higher
energies, the positron fraction is dominated by a small number of pulsars,
making it difficult to reliably predict the shape of the expected positron
fraction. The low-energy positron spectrum supports the conclusion that pulsars
typically transfer approximately $\eta \sim 5-20\%$ of their total spindown
power into the production of very high-energy electron-positron pairs,
producing a spectrum of such particles with a hard spectral index, $\alpha \sim
1.5-1.7$. Such pulsars typically spindown on a timescale on the order of $\tau
\sim 10^4 \, {\rm years}$. Our best fits were obtained for models in which the
radio and gamma-ray beams from pulsars are detectable to 28% and 62% of
surrounding observers, respectively.

moderate X-ray luminosity of $8\times10^{39}$ erg/s and a hard power-law
spectrum with $\Gamma \lesssim 1.9$. Due to low variability of the object in
X-rays (by a factor 1.5) and insignificant variability in the UV range (upper
limit $\approx25$%) we could not find reliable correlation between flux changes
in these ranges. Inside each particular observation, the X-ray variability
amplitude is higher, it reaches a factor of 2-3 respect to the mean level at

Title:Disruption of Saturn's ring particles by thermal stress,"
Abstract:  Spacecraft and ground-based observations show that the main rings of Saturn
lack particles larger than 10 m. Tidal or collisional destruction of
satellites/comets have been proposed as the origin of the main rings; however,
Saturn's tide alone cannot grind km-sized fragments into submeter-sized
particles because of the high mechanical strength of water ice and rock. The
question arises as to why such large particles are not left in the current
ring. It is known that thermal stress induced by diurnal and seasonal
temperature variations can cause weathering and fragmentation of boulders and
contribute to dust and regolith production on the Moon and terrestrial planets,
and then such thermal stress can break particles larger than a critical radius
while cannot smaller than the critical radius. In this study, we examined the
role of thermal stress acting on Saturn's ring particles. We found that thermal
stress can grind porous ring particles larger than 10-20 m, which explains the
lack of particles larger than 10 m in Saturn's ring. Also, fragmentation by
thermal stress can be adoptable for the Epsilon rings of Uranus. Furthermore,
thermal stress caused by diurnal or seasonal temperature variation acting on
boulders on surfaces of icy satellites and asteroids may play an important role
in the evolution of their sizes. Our calculations explain the lack of boulders
on icy satellites, except in the geologically active provinces such as the
tiger stripes of Enceladus, where boulders are supplied by recent geological
activity. We predict that future observations can find numerous boulders around
Europa's geologically active cracks.

Title:A global system of furrows on Ganymede indicative of their creation in a single impact event,"
Abstract:  Furrows are a concentric system of tectonic troughs, and are the oldest
recognizable surface feature on Ganymede. We analyzed the distribution of
furrows utilizing Voyager and Galileo images and found that furrows over
Ganymede's surface are part of a global concentric circular structure. If this
multi-ring structure is impact origin, this is the largest impact structure
identified so far in the solar system. Deviations of the shapes of the furrows
from the concentricity are small everywhere, which implies that the relative
location of the blocks of the dark terrains over the entire surface of Ganymede
has not changed appreciably even during formation of the bright terrains. The
estimate of the impactor size is difficult, but an 150km-radius impactor is
consistent with the observed properties of furrows. The furrow-forming impact
should have significant effects on the satellite's geological and internal
evolution, which are expected to be confirmed by future explorations of
Jupiter's icy moons, such as the JUICE (Jupiter Icy moon Explorer) or Europa
Clipper mission.

Title:Rotational effect as the possible cause of the east-west asymmetric crater rims on Ryugu observed by LIDAR data,"
Abstract:  Asteroid 162173 Ryugu is a rubble-pile asteroid, whose top-shape is
compatible with models of deformation by spin up. Rims of major craters on
Ryugu have an east-west asymmetric profile; their western crater rims are sharp
and tall, while their eastern crater rims are rounded and low. Although there
are various possible explanations, we theoretically assess the effect of
asteroid rotation as the possible reason for this east-west asymmetry. It is
known that the trajectories and fates of ejecta are affected by the rotation.
The Coriolis force and the inertial speed of the rotating surface are the
factors altering the ejecta trajectories. Consequently, we found that the
east-west asymmetric crater rims might be formed as a result of rotation, when
the inertial speed of the rotating surface is nearly equal to the first cosmic
velocity of the body. In other words, it is possible that the observed
east-west asymmetric rims of the Urashima, Cendrillon, and Kolobok craters were
formed when Ryugu's rotation period was ~3.6 h.

Title:The formation of Haumea and its family via binary merging,"
Abstract:  Dozens of families of asteroids in the asteroid belt have similar orbits and
compositions because they formed through a collision. However, the icy debris
beyond the orbit of Neptune, called the Kuiper Belt, contains only one known
family, the Haumea family. So far, no self-consistent explanation for the
formation of the Haumea family can match all geophysical and orbital
characteristics of the family without invoking extremely improbable events.
Here, we show that the family is adequately explained as the product of a
merging binary near the end of Neptune's orbital migration. The unique orbital
signature of a merging binary, which was not found in extensive searches, is
effectively erased during the final stages of migration, providing an
explanation for all aspects of the Haumea family. By placing the formation of
the Haumea family in the broader context of solar system formation, we
demonstrate a proof-of-concept model for the formation of Haumea.

Title:Distinguishing Primordial Magnetic Fields from Inflationary Tensor Perturbations in the Cosmic Microwave Background,"
Abstract:  A claimed detection of cosmological tensor perturbations from inflation via
B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background requires distinguishing
other possible B-mode sources. One such potential source of confusion is
primordial magnetic fields. For sufficiently low-amplitude B-mode signals, the
microwave background temperature and polarization power spectra from power-law
tensor perturbations and from a power-law primordial magnetic field are
indistinguishable. However, we show that such a magnetic field will induce a
small-scale Faraday rotation which is detectable using four-point statistics
analogous to gravitational lensing of the microwave background. The Faraday
rotation signal will distinguish a magnetic-field induced B-mode polarization
signal from tensor perturbations for effective tensor-scalar ratios larger than
0.001, detectable in upcoming polarization experiments.

Title:Enhanced Star Formation Activity of Extreme Jellyfish Galaxies in Massive Clusters and the Role of Ram Pressure Stripping,"
Abstract:  Jellyfish galaxies are an excellent tool to investigate the short-term
effects of ram pressure stripping (RPS) on star formation in cluster
environments. It has been thought that the star formation activity of jellyfish
galaxies may depend on the host cluster properties, but previous studies have
not yet found a clear correlation. In this study, we estimate the \Ha-based
star formation rates (SFRs) of five jellyfish galaxies in massive clusters
($\sigma_{v, {\rm cl}}\gtrsim1000~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$) at $z\sim0.3-0.4$ using
Gemini GMOS/IFU observations to explore the relationship. Combining our results
with those in the literature, we find that the star formation activity of
jellyfish galaxies shows a positive correlation with their host cluster
velocity dispersion as a proxy of cluster mass and dynamical states. We divide
the jellyfish galaxy sample into two groups with strong and weak RPS signatures
using a morphological class. In the phase-space diagram, the jellyfish galaxies
with strong RPS features show a higher SFR and a stronger central concentration
than those with weak RPS features. We estimate their SFR excess relative to the
star formation main sequence (starburstiness; $R_{\rm SB}={\rm
SFR/SFR_{MS}}(z)$) and the density of the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM)
using scaling relations with the cluster velocity dispersion. As a result, the
starburstiness of jellyfish galaxies with strong RPS signatures clearly
exhibits positive correlations with cluster velocity dispersion, ICM density,
and strength of ram pressure. This shows that the relation between RPS and star
formation activity of jellyfish galaxies depends on the host cluster properties
and strength of ram pressure.

Abstract:  I analyzed Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations of the

""textbook"" superhump stages A, B and C confirmed by modern satellite

During the growing phase of superhumps, the period was initially close to, but
slightly longer than the orbital period. Observers should pay attention to the
presence of such a phenomenon not to confuse the phenomenon with early
superhumps seen in WZ Sge stars. After the superoutburst, superhumps were
detected for additional 18 d with the same period and no orbital signal was
detected. Small wiggles with a period of ~0.5 d were recorded in the
post-superoutburst phase and they may be the same phenomenon recorded in the
Kepler data of the SU UMa star V585 Lyr.

Title:Lensing cosmic drift,"
Abstract:  As the Universe expands, the redshift of distant sources changes with time.
Here we discuss gravitational lensing phenomena that are consequence of the
redshift drift between lensed source, gravitational lens, and observer. When
the source is located very close to the drifting caustics, a pair of images
could occur (or disappear) because of the cosmological expansion. Furthermore,
lensing systems act as signal converters of the redshift drift. The angular
position, magnification, distortion, and time delay of already existing
multiple images change. We estimate the expected frequency of these phenomena
and the prospects to observe them in the era of deep and large surveys. The
drift detection in image separation could be within reach of next generation
surveys with $\mu$arcsec angular resolution.

Title:The AGEL Survey: Spectroscopic Confirmation of Strong Gravitational Lenses in the DES and DECaLS Fields Selected Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"
Abstract:  We present spectroscopic confirmation of candidate strong gravitational
lenses using the Keck Observatory and Very Large Telescope as part of our ASTRO
3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey. We confirm that 1) search
methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with visual inspection
successfully identify strong gravitational lenses and 2) the lenses are at
higher redshifts relative to existing surveys due to the combination of deeper
and higher resolution imaging from DECam and spectroscopy spanning optical to
near-infrared wavelengths. We measure 104 redshifts in 77 systems selected from
a catalog in the DES and DECaLS imaging fields (r<22 mag). Combining our
results with published redshifts, we present redshifts for 68 lenses and
establish that CNN-based searches are highly effective for use in future
imaging surveys with a success rate of 88% (defined as 68/77). We report 53
strong lenses with spectroscopic redshifts for both the deflector and source
(z_src>z_defl), and 15 lenses with a spectroscopic redshift for either the
deflector (z_defl>0.21) or source (z_src>1.34). For the 68 lenses, the
deflectors and sources have average redshifts and standard deviations of
0.58+/-0.14 and 1.92+/-0.59 respectively, and corresponding redshift ranges of
(0.21<z_defl<0.89) and (0.88<z_src<3.55). The AGEL systems include 41
deflectors at zdefl>0.5 that are ideal for follow-up studies to track how mass
density profiles evolve with redshift. Our goal with AGEL is to
spectroscopically confirm ~100 strong gravitational lenses that can be observed
from both hemispheres throughout the year. The AGEL survey is a resource for

Title:High frequency decayless waves with significant energy in Solar Orbiter/EUI observations,"
Abstract:  High-frequency wave phenomena present a great deal of interest as one of the
possible candidates to contribute to the energy input required to heat the
corona as a part of the AC heating theory. However, the resolution of imaging
instruments up until the Solar Orbiter have made it impossible to resolve the
necessary time and spatial scales. The present paper reports on high-frequency
transverse motions in a small loop located in a quiet Sun region of the corona.
The oscillations were observed with the HRIEUV telescope (17.4 nm) of the EUI
instrument onboard the Solar Orbiter. We detect two transverse oscillations in
short loops with lengths of 4.5 Mm and 11 Mm. The shorter loop displays an
oscillation with a 14 s period and the longer a 30 s period. Despite the high
resolution, no definitive identification as propagating or standing waves is
possible. The velocity amplitudes are found to be equal to 72 km/s and 125
km/s, respectively, for the shorter and longer loop. Based on that, we also
estimated the values of the energy flux contained in the loops - the energy
flux of the 14 s oscillation is 1.9 kW m^-2 and of the 30 s oscillation it is
6.5 kW m^-2 . While these oscillations have been observed in the Quiet Sun,
their energy fluxes are of the same order as the energy input required to heat
the active solar corona. Numerical simulations were performed in order to
reproduce the observed oscillations. The correspondence of the numerical
results to the observations provide support to the energy content estimates for
the observations. Such high energy densities have not yet been observed in
decayless coronal waves, and this is promising for coronal heating models based
on wave damping.

Title:Reflection Symmetry in the Folded Light Curve of the Crab Pulsar from NICER,"
Abstract:  The Rotation powered pulsars Crab, Vela and Geminga have double peaked folded
light curves (FLC) at $\gamma$-ray energies, that have an approximate
reflection symmetry. Here this aspect is studied at soft X-ray energy by
analyzing a high resolution FLC of the Crab pulsar obtained at $1 - 10$ keV
using the {\it{NICER}} observatory. The rising edge of the first peak of the
FLC and the reflected version of the falling edge of the second peak are
compared in several ways, and phase ranges are identified where the two curves
are statistically similar. The best matching occurs when the two peaks are
aligned, but only in a small phase range of $\approx 0.0244$ just below their
peaks; their mean difference is $-0.78 \pm 1.8$ photons/sec with a reduced
$\chi^2$ of $0.93$. If the first curve is convolved by a Laplace function, the
corresponding numbers are phase range of $\approx 0.0274$, mean difference of
$-1.23 \pm 1.30$ and $\chi^2$ of $0.76$. These phase ranges are much smaller
than those over which the reflection symmetry has been perceived. Therefore the
only way the two edges can have a mirror relation over a substantial phase
range is if one invokes a broad and faint emission component of amplitude
$\approx 100$ photons/sec and width $\approx 0.1$ in phase, centered at phase
$\approx 0.1$ beyond the second peak.

Title:A new look at the frequency-dependent damping of slow-mode waves in the solar corona,"
Abstract:  Being directly observed in the Doppler shift and imaging data and indirectly
as quasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellar flares, slow magnetoacoustic
waves offer an important seismological tool for probing many vital parameters
of the coronal plasma. A recently understood active nature of the solar corona
for magnetoacoustic waves, manifested through the phenomenon of wave-induced
thermal misbalance, led to the identification of new natural mechanisms for the
interpretation of observed properties of waves. A frequency-dependent damping
of slow waves in various coronal plasma structures remains an open question, as
traditional wave damping theories fail to match observations. We demonstrate
that accounting for the back-reaction caused by thermal misbalance on the wave
dynamics leads to a modification of the relationship between the damping time
and oscillation period of standing slow waves, prescribed by the linear theory.
The modified relationship is not of a power-law form and has the equilibrium
plasma conditions and properties of the coronal heating/cooling processes as
free parameters. It is shown to readily explain the observed scaling of the
damping time with period of standing slow waves in hot coronal loops.
Functional forms of the unknown coronal heating process, consistent with the
observed frequency-dependent damping, are seismologically revealed.

Title:Expanding shells around young clusters -- S 171/Be 59,"
Abstract:  Some HII regions that surround young stellar clusters are bordered by
molecular shells that appear to expand at a rate inconsistent with our current
model simulations. In this study we focus on the dynamics of Sharpless 171
(including NGC 7822), which surrounds the cluster Berkeley 59. We aim to
compare the velocity pattern over the molecular shell with the mean radial
velocity of the cluster for estimates of the expansion velocities of different
shell structures, and to match the observed properties with model simulations.
Optical spectra of 27 stars located in Berkeley 59 were collected at the Nordic
Optical Telescope, and a number of molecular structures scattered over the
entire region were mapped in $^{13}$CO(1-0) at Onsala Space Observatory. We
obtained radial velocities and MK classes for the cluster's stars. At least
four of the O stars are found to be spectroscopic binaries, in addition to one
triplet system. From these data we obtain the mean radial velocity of the
cluster. From the $^{13}$CO spectra we identify three shell structures,
expanding relative to the cluster at moderate velocity (4 km/s), high velocity
(12 km/s), and in between. The high-velocity cloudlets extend over a larger
radius and are less massive than the low-velocity cloudlets. We performed a
model simulation to understand the evolution of this complex. Our simulation of
the Sharpless 171 complex and Berkeley 59 cluster demonstrates that the
individual components can be explained as a shell driven by stellar winds from
the massive cluster members. However, our relatively simple model produces a
single component. Modelling of the propagation of shell fragments through a
uniform interstellar medium demonstrates that dense cloudlets detached from the
shell are decelerated less efficiently than the shell itself. They can reach
greater distances and retain higher velocities than the shell.

observational resources (in particular, the TESS and Fermi orbiting
observatories). In addition, complementary ground-based optical spectroscopy

Title:MOCCA: Dynamics and evolution of binary stars of multiple stellar populations in tidally filling and underfilling globular star clusters,"
Abstract:  We present an upgraded version of the \MOCCA code for the study of dynamical
evolution of globular clusters (GCs) and its first application to the study of
evolution of multiple stellar populations. We explore initial conditions
spanning different structural parameters for the first (FG) and second
generation of stars (SG) and we analyze their effect on the binary dynamics and
survival. Here, we focus on the number ratio of FG and SG binaries, its spatial
variation, and the way their abundances are affected by various cluster initial
properties. We find that present-day SG stars are more abundant in clusters
that were initially tidally filling. Conversely, FG stars stay more abundant in
clusters that were initially tidally underfilling. We find that the ratio
between binary fractions is not affected by the way we calculate these
fractions (e.g. only main-sequence binaries (MS) or observational binaries,
i.e. MS stars $> 0.4 M_{\odot}$ mass ratios $> 0.5$). This implies that the MS
stars themselves are a very good proxy for probing entire populations of FG and
SG. We also discuss how it relates to the observations of Milky Way GCs. We
show that \MOCCA models are able to reproduce the observed range of SG
fractions for Milky Way GCs for which we know these fractions. We show how the
SG fractions depend on the initial conditions and provide some constraints for
the initial conditions to have more numerous FG or SG stars at the Hubble time.

Title:Gamma-ray Diagnostics of r-process Nucleosynthesis in the Remnants of Galactic Binary Neutron-Star Mergers,"
Abstract:  We perform a full nuclear-network numerical calculation of the $r$-process
nuclei in binary neutron-star mergers (NSMs), with the aim of estimating
$\gamma$-ray emissions from the remnants of Galactic NSMs up to $10^6$ years
old. The nucleosynthesis calculation of 4,070 nuclei is adopted to provide the
elemental composition ratios of nuclei with an electron fraction $Y_{\rm e}$
between 0.10 and 0.45 . The decay processes of 3,237 unstable nuclei are
simulated to extract the $\gamma$-ray spectra. As a result, the NSMs have
different spectral color in $\gamma$-ray band from various other astronomical
objects at less than $10^5$ years old. In addition, we propose a new
line-diagnostic method for $Y_{\rm e}$ that uses the line ratios of either
$^{137{\rm m}}$Ba/$^{85}$K or $^{243}$Am/$^{60{\rm m}}$Co, which become larger
than unity for young and old $r$-process sites, respectively, with a low
$Y_{\rm e}$ environment. From an estimation of the distance limit for
$\gamma$-ray observations as a function of the age, the high sensitivity in the
sub-MeV band, at approximately $10^{-9}$ photons s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ or
$10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, is required to cover all the NSM remnants in
our Galaxy if we assume that the population of NSMs by

Title:Gravitational Lensing of Gravitational Waves: Probability of Microlensing in Galaxy-Scale Lens Population,"
Abstract:  With the increase in the number of observed gravitational wave (GW) signals,
detecting strongly lensed GWs by galaxies has become a real possibility. Lens
galaxies also contain microlenses (e.g., stars and black holes), introducing
further frequency-dependent modulations in the strongly lensed GW signal within
the LIGO frequency range. The multiple lensed signals in a given lens system
have different underlying macro-magnifications ($|\mu|$) and are located in
varied microlens densities ($\Sigma_\bullet$), leading to different levels of
microlensing distortions. This work quantifies the fraction of strong lens
systems affected by microlensing using realistic mock observations. We study 50
quadruply imaged systems (quads) by generating 50 realizations for each lensed
signal. However, our conclusions are equally valid for lensed signals in doubly
imaged systems (doubles). The lensed signals studied here have $|\mu|\sim[0.5,
10]$ and $\Sigma_\bullet\sim[10, 10^3]~{\rm M}_\odot/{\rm pc^2}$. We find that
the microlensing effects are more sensitive to the macro-magnification than the
underlying microlens density, even if the latter exceeds $10^3~{\rm
M}_\odot/{\rm pc^2}$. The mismatch between lensed and unlensed GW signals
rarely exceeds $1\%$ for nearly all binary black hole sources in the total mass
range [10 M$_\odot$, 200 M$_\odot$]. This implies that microlensing is not
expected to affect the detection or the parameter estimation of such signals
and does not pose any further challenges in identifying the different lensed
counterparts when macro-magnification is ${\leq}10$. Such a magnification cut
is expected to be satisfied by ${\sim}50\%$ of the detectable pairs in quads
and ${\sim}90\%$ of the doubles in the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo
detector network.

Title:A void in the Hubble tension? The end of the line for the Hubble bubble,"
Abstract:  The Universe may feature large-scale inhomogeneities beyond the standard
paradigm, implying that statistical homogeneity and isotropy may be reached
only on much larger scales than the usually assumed $\sim$100 Mpc. This means
that we are not necessarily typical observers and that the Copernican principle
could be recovered only on super-Hubble scales. Here, we do not assume the
validity of the Copernican principle and let Cosmic Microwave Background,
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, type Ia supernovae, local $H_0$, cosmic
chronometers, Compton y-distortion and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich observations
constrain the geometrical degrees of freedom of the local structure, which we
parametrize via the $\Lambda$LTB model -- basically a non-linear radial
perturbation of a FLRW metric. In order to quantify if a non-Copernican
structure could explain away the Hubble tension, we pay careful attention to
computing the Hubble constant in an inhomogeneous universe, and we adopt model
selection via both the Bayes factor and the Akaike information criterion. Our
results show that, while the $\Lambda$LTB model can successfully explain away
the $H_0$ tension, it is favored with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model only if
one solely considers supernovae in the redshift range that is used to fit the
Hubble constant, that is, $0.023<z<0.15$. If one considers all the supernova
sample, then the $H_0$ tension is not solved and the support for the
$\Lambda$LTB model vanishes. Combined with other data sets, this solution to
the Hubble tension barely helps. Finally, we have reconstructed our local
spacetime. We have found that data are best fit by a shallow void with
$\delta_L \approx -0.04$ and $r^{\mathrm{out}}_L \approx 300$ Mpc, which,
interestingly, lies on the border of the 95\% credible region relative to the
standard model expectation.

Abstract:  Linear cosmological observables can be used to probe elastic scattering of

critical reassessment of any assumptions that may impact the accuracy of
constraints. The standard formalism for constraining DM-baryon scattering
pre-recombination is based on assuming a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) velocity
distribution for DM. This assumption is not always justified and does not allow
for probing DM self-interactions in addition to its interactions with baryons.
Lifting the MB assumption requires solving the full collisional Boltzmann
equation (CBE), which is highly non-trivial. Earlier work proposed a more
tractable Fokker-Planck (FP) approximation to the CBE, but its accuracy
remained unknown. In this work, we numerically solve the exact CBE for the
first time, in a homogeneous expanding background. We consider DM-baryon
scattering cross-sections that are positive power-laws of relative velocity. We
derive analytical expressions for the collision operator in the case of
isotropic differential scattering cross-sections. We then solve the background
CBE numerically and use our solution for the DM velocity distribution to
compute the DM-baryon heat-exchange rate, which we compare against those
obtained with the MB assumption and FP approximation. Over a broad range of
DM-to-baryon mass ratios, we find that the FP approximation leads to a maximum
error of 17%, significantly better than the up to 160% error introduced by the
MB assumption. While our results strictly apply only to the background
evolution, the accuracy of the FP approximation is likely to carry over to
perturbations. This motivates its implementation into cosmological Boltzmann
codes, where it can supersede the much less accurate MB assumption, and allow
for a more general exploration of DM interactions with baryons and with itself.

Title:Comprehensive study of mass ejection and nucleosynthesis in binary neutron star mergers leaving short-lived massive neutron stars,"
Abstract:  By performing general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations with an
approximate neutrino-radiation transfer, the properties of ejecta in dynamical
and post-merger phases are investigated for the cases in which the remnant
massive neutron star collapses into a black hole in $\lesssim 20$ ms after the
onset of the merger. The dynamical mass ejection is investigated in
three-dimensional simulations. The post-merger mass ejection is investigated in
two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations with viscosity using the
three-dimensional post-merger systems as the initial conditions. We show that
the typical neutron-richness of the dynamical ejecta is higher for the merger
of more asymmetric binaries; hence, heavier $r$-process nuclei are dominantly
synthesized. The post-merger ejecta are shown to have only a mild
neutron-richness, which results in the production of lighter $r$-process
nuclei, irrespective of binary mass ratios. Because of the larger disk mass,
the post-merger ejecta mass is larger for more asymmetric binary mergers. Thus,
the post-merger ejecta can compensate for the underproduced lighter $r$-process
nuclei for asymmetric merger cases. As a result, by summing up both ejecta
components, the solar residual $r$-process pattern is reproduced within the
average deviation of a factor of three, irrespective of the binary mass ratio.
Our result also indicates that the (about a factor of a few) light-to-heavy
abundance scatter observed in $r$-process-enhanced stars can be attributed to
variation in the binary mass ratio and total mass. Implications of our results
associated with the mass distribution of compact neutron star binaries and the
magnetar scenario of short gamma-ray bursts are discussed.

Title:No correlation of the Lyman continuum escape fraction with spectral hardness,"
Abstract:  The properties that govern the production and escape of hydrogen ionizing
photons (Lyman continuum, LyC; with energies >13.6 eV) in star-forming galaxies
are still poorly understood, but they are key to identifying and characterizing
the sources that reionized the Universe. Here we empirically explore the
relationship between the hardness of ionizing radiation and the LyC leakage in
a large sample of low-$z$ star-forming galaxies from the recent Hubble Space
Telescope Low-$z$ Lyman Continuum Survey. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey stacks
and deep XShooter observations, we investigate the hardness of the ionizing
spectra ($Q_{\rm He^+}/Q_{\rm H}$) between 54.4 eV (He$^{+}$) and 13.6 eV (H)
from the optical recombination lines HeII 4686A and H$\beta$ 4861A for galaxies
with LyC escape fractions spanning a wide range, $f_{\rm esc} \rm (LyC) \simeq
0 - 90\%$. We find that the observed intensity of HeII/H$\beta$ is primarily
driven by variations in the metallicity, but is not correlated with LyC
leakage. Both very strong ($<f_{\rm esc} \rm (LyC)> \simeq 0.5$) and nonleakers
($ < f_{\rm esc} \rm (LyC) > \simeq 0$) present similar observed intensities of
HeII/H$\beta$ at comparable metallicity, between $\simeq 0.01$ and $\simeq
0.02$ for $12 + \log({\rm O/H}) > 8.0$ and $<8.0$, respectively. Our results
demonstrate that $Q_{\rm He^+}/Q_{\rm H}$ does not correlate with $f_{\rm esc}
\rm (LyC)$, which implies that strong LyC emitters do not show harder ionizing
spectra than nonleakers at similar metallicity.

Title:X-ray Eclipse Mapping Constrains the Binary Inclination and Mass Ratio of Swift J1858.6-0814,"
Abstract:  X-ray eclipse mapping is a promising modelling technique, capable of
constraining the mass and/or radius of neutron stars (NSs) or black holes (BHs)
in eclipsing binaries and probing any structure surrounding the companion star.
In eclipsing systems, the binary inclination, $i$, and mass ratio, $q$ relate
via the duration of totality, $t_{e}$. The degeneracy between $i$ and $q$ can
then be broken through detailed modelling of the eclipse profile. Here we model
the eclipses of the NS low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1858.6$-$0814 utilising
archival NICER observations taken while the source was in outburst. Analogous
to EXO 0748$-$676, we find evidence for irradiation driven ablation of the
companion's surface by requiring a layer of stellar material to surround the
companion star in our modelling. This material layer extends $\sim 7000 -
14000$ km from the companion's surface and is likely the cause of the extended,
energy-dependent and asymmetric ingress and egress that we observe. Our fits
return an inclination of $i \sim 81^{\circ}$ and a mass ratio $q \sim 0.14$.
Using Kepler's law to relate the mass and radius of the companion star via the
orbital period ($\sim$ 21.3 hrs), we subsequently determine the companion to
have a low mass in the range $0.183 M_{\odot} \leq M_{cs} \leq 0.372 M_{\odot}$
and a large radius in the range $1.02 R_{\odot} \leq R_{cs} \leq 1.29
R_{\odot}$. Our results, combined with future radial velocity amplitudes
measured from stellar absorption/emission lines, can place precise constraints
on the component masses in this system.

Title:The dynamical state of RXCJ1230.7+3439: a multi-substructured merging galaxy cluster,"
Abstract:  We analyse the kinematical and dynamical state of the galaxy cluster
RXCJ1230.7+3439, at z=0.332, using 93 new spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies
acquired at the 3.6m TNG telescope and from SDSS DR16 public data. We find that
RXCJ1230 appears as a clearly isolated peak in the redshift space, with a
global line-of-sight velocity dispersion of $1004_{-122}^{+147}$ km s$^{-1}$,
and showing a very complex structure with the presence of three subclusters.
Our analyses confirm that the three substructures detected are in a pre-merger
phase, where the main interaction takes place with the south-west subclump. We
compute a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_\textrm{v} \sim 1000$ and
$\sigma_\textrm{v} \sim 800$ km s$^{-1}$ for the main cluster and the
south-west substructure, respectively. The central main body and south-west
substructure differ by $\sim 870$ km s$^{-1}$ in the LOS velocity. From these
data, we estimate a dynamical mass of $M_{200}= 9.0 \pm 1.5 \times 10^{14}$
M$_{\odot}$ and $4.4 \pm 3.3 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the RXCJ1230 main
body and south-west clump, respectively, which reveals that the cluster will
suffer a merging characterized by a 2:1 mass ratio impact. We solve a two-body
problem for this interaction and find that the most likely solution suggests
that the merging axis lies almost contained in the plane of the sky and the
subcluster will fully interact in $\sim0.3$ Gyr. The comparison between the
dynamical masses and those derived from X-ray data reveals a good agreement
within errors (differences $\sim 15$\%), which suggests that the innermost
regions ($<r_{500}$) of the galaxy clumps are almost in hydrostatical
equilibrium. To summarize, RXCJ1230 is a young but also massive cluster in a
pre-merging phase accreeting other galaxy systems from its environment.

cosmological parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as the nuisance

an upper limit of $r<0.037$ at 95% C.L., similar to the Bayesian MCMC result of
$r<0.038$ for a flat prior on $r$ and a conditioned $Planck$ lowlEB covariance
matrix.

Title:CENN: A fully convolutional neural network for CMB recovery in realistic microwave sky simulations,"
Abstract:  Component separation is the process with which emission sources in
astrophysical maps are generally extracted by taking multi-frequency
information into account. It is crucial to develop more reliable methods for
component separation for future CMB experiments. We aim to develop a new method
based on fully convolutional neural networks called the Cosmic microwave
background Extraction Neural Network (CENN) in order to extract the CMB signal
in total intensity. The frequencies used are the Planck channels 143, 217 and
353 GHz. We validate the network at all sky, and at three latitude intervals:
lat1=0^{\circ}<b<5^{\circ}, lat2=5^{\circ}<b<30^{\circ} and
lat3=30^{\circ}<b<90^{\circ}, without using any Galactic or point source masks.
For training, we make realistic simulations in the form of patches of area 256
pixels, which contain the CMB, Dust, CIB and PS emissions, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect and the instrumental noise. After validate the network, we compare the
power spectrum from input and output maps. We analyse the power spectrum from
the residuals at each latitude interval and at all sky and we study the
performance of our model dealing with high contamination at small scales. We
obtain a power spectrum with an error of 13{\pm}113 {\mu}K^2 for multipoles up
to above 4000. For residuals, we obtain 700{\pm}60 {\mu}K^2 for lat1, 80{\pm}30
{\mu}K^2 for lat2 and 30{\pm}20 {\mu}K^2 for lat3. For all sky, we obtain
20{\pm}10 {\mu}K^2. We validate the network in a patch with strong
contamination at small scales, obtaining an error of 50{\pm}120 {\mu}K^2 and
residuals of 40{\pm}10 {\mu}K^2. Therefore, fully convolutional neural networks
are promising methods to perform component separation in future CMB
experiments. Particularly, CENN is reliable against different levels of
contamination from Galactic and point source foregrounds at both large and
small scales.

Title:Do you smell something decaying? Updated linear constraints on decaying dark matter scenarios,"
Abstract:  The stability of particles in the cosmic soup is an important property that
can affect the cosmic evolution. In this work, we update the constraints on the
decaying cold dark matter scenario, when the decay products are effectively
massless. We assume, as a base case, that all of dark matter is unstable and it
can decay on cosmological time scales. We then extend the analysis to include
the scenario where only a fraction of dark matter is unstable, while the
remaining part is composed of the standard, stable, dark matter. We consider
observations of cosmological probes at linear scales, i.e., Planck 2018 cosmic
microwave background temperature, polarization, and lensing measurements, along
with geometrical information from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
measurements from SDSS DR7, BOSS DR12, eBOSS DR16 and 6dFGS, to derive
conservative constraints on the dark matter decay rate. We consider these
dataset separately, to asses the relative constraining power of each dataset,
as well as together to asses the joint constraints. We find the most stringent
upper limit on the decay rate of decaying cold dark matter particles to be
$\Gammadm < 0.129 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (or, equivalently, the dark
matter lifetime $\taudm > 246$ Gyr) at 95\% C.L. for the combination of Planck
primary anisotropies, lensing and BAO. We further explore one-parameter
extensions of our baseline DCDM model. Namely, we vary the sum of neutrino
masses, the curvature density parameter, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio along
with the DCDM parameters. When varying the tensor-to-scalar ratio we also add
data from the BICEP/Keck experiment.

Title:Linking pressure gradients with the stability of molecular clouds in galactic outflows,"
Abstract:  The jets launched by actively accreting black holes are capable of launching
several of the massive (million or billion solar mass) molecular outflows
observed in galaxies. These outflows could suppress or enhance star formation
in galaxies. To investigate the stability of clouds capable to form stars in
outflows, we modeled CO and HCO+ ALMA data of the galaxy IC5063, in which
black-hole jets impact molecular clouds. Using a radiative transfer code that
self-consistently performs astrochemical and thermal balance calculations based
on the available gas heating sources, we found that mechanical heating and
cosmic ray (CR) heating are fully capable of individually reproducing the data.
In our best-fit model, CRs provide about 1/3rd of the dense gas heating at the
radio lobes, emphasizing the role of this often neglected mechanism in heating
the gas and potentially generating outflows. The gas temperature and density
indicate that the jet passage leads to an increase of about 1 order of
magnitude in the internal pressure Pi of molecular clouds (with Pi/k from
8*10^5 up to 7*10^6 K cm^-3), irrespective of the excitation mechanism. From
the fluxes of [S II] and [N II] lines in VLT MUSE data, the external pressure
Pe of molecular clouds increases in several regions enough to exceed Pi. This
result leads us to conclude that we are observing the expansion of an ionized
overpressurized cocoon that compresses molecular clouds and that could lead to
their collapse. Some jet-impacted clouds, nonetheless, near pathways that the
jet cleared have increased Pi and decreased Pe. They are likely to undergo
evaporation of their outer layers. Part of the evaporated layers could mass
load the outflow thanks to ram pressure from co-spatial ionized gas flows. The
observed pressure changes thus suggest that both star formation enhancement and
suppression could simultaneously occur.

Abstract:  Gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds of cosmological origin are expected to be
nearly isotropic, with small anisotropies resembling those of the cosmic

clarify in the process the relation between two different approaches to
calculating GW anisotropies. We focus on GW scenarios sourced by a
significantly peaked scalar spectrum, which are frequently considered in the
context of primordial black holes production. We show that the resulting GW
anisotropies are characterised by a distinct frequency dependence. We explore
the observational consequences concentrating on a GW background enhanced in the
frequency band of space-based GW detectors. We study the detectability of the
signal through both cross-correlations among different space-based GW
detectors, and among GW and CMB experiments.

10~\mathrm{pc}$ away from our solar system) via micro-arcsecond relative
astrometry. The major scientific objectives of CHES are: to search for Earth
Twins or terrestrial planets in habitable zones orbiting 100 FGK nearby stars;
further to conduct a comprehensive survey and extensively characterize the
nearby planetary systems. The primary payload is a high-quality,
low-distortion, high-stability telescope. The optical subsystem is a coaxial
three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) with a $1.2 \mathrm{~m}$-aperture, $0.44^{\circ}
\times 0.44^{\circ}$ field of view and $500 \mathrm{~nm}-900 \mathrm{~nm}$
working waveband. The camera focal plane is composed of 81 MOSAIC scientific
CMOS detectors each with $4 \mathrm{~K} \times 4 \mathrm{~K}$ pixels. The
heterodyne laser interferometric calibration technology is employed to ensure
micro-arcsecond level (1 $\mu$as) relative astrometry precision to meet the
requirements for detection of Earth-like planets. CHES satellite operates at
the Sun-Earth L2 point and observes the entire target stars for 5 years. CHES
will offer the first direct measurements of true masses and inclinations of
Earth Twins and super-Earths orbiting our neighbor stars based on
micro-arcsecond astrometry from space. This will definitely enhance our
understanding of the formation of diverse nearby planetary systems and the
emergence of other worlds for solar-type stars, and finally to reflect the

Title:Ocean signatures in the total flux and polarization spectra of Earth-like exoplanets,"
Abstract:  Numerical simulations of starlight that is reflected by Earth-like exoplanets
predict habitability signatures that can be searched for with future
telescopes. We explore signatures of water oceans in the flux and polarization
spectra of this reflected light. With an adding-doubling algorithm, we compute
the total flux F, polarized flux Q and degree of polarization P of starlight
reflected by dry and ocean model planets with Earth-like atmospheres and patchy
clouds. The oceans consist of Fresnel reflecting surfaces with wind-ruffled
waves, foam and wave shadows, above natural blue seawater. Our results are
presented as functions of wavelength (from 300 to 2500 nm with 1 nm resolution)
and as functions of the planetary phase angle from 90 to 170 degrees. The ocean
glint increases F, |Q| and P with increasing phase angle at non-absorbing
wavelengths, and causes the spectra of F and |Q| for the various phase angles
to intersect. In the near-infrared, Q is negative, i.e. the direction of
polarization is perpendicular to the plane through the star, planet, and
observer. In the P-spectra, the glint leaves dips (instead of peaks) in gaseous
absorption bands. All those signatures are missing in the spectra of dry
planets. The dips in P, and the negative Q in the near-infrared, can be
searched for at a phase angle of 90 degrees, where the planet-star separation
is largest. Those ocean signatures in polarized light do not suffer from false
positive glint signals that could be due to clouds or reflecting dry surfaces.
For heavily cloudy planets, ocean detection is possible when the glint is
(partially) cloud-free. When modelling signals of planets with oceans, using
horizontally inhomogeneous cloud covers is thus crucial. Observations spread
over time would increase the probability of catching a cloud-free glint and
detecting an ocean.

Title:Can we actually constrain $f_{\rm NL}$ using the scale-dependent bias effect? An illustration of the impact of galaxy bias uncertainties using the BOSS DR12 galaxy power spectrum,"
Abstract:  The scale-dependent bias effect on the galaxy power spectrum is a very
promising probe of the local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) parameter $f_{\rm
NL}$, but the amplitude of the effect is proportional to $f_{\rm NL}b_{\phi}$,
where $b_{\phi}$ is the linear PNG galaxy bias parameter. Our knowledge of
$b_{\phi}$ is currently very limited, yet nearly all existing $f_{\rm NL}$
constraints and forecasts assume precise knowledge for it. Here, we use the
BOSS DR12 galaxy power spectrum to illustrate how our uncertain knowledge of
$b_{\phi}$ currently prevents us from constraining $f_{\rm NL}$ with a given
statistical precision $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}$. Assuming different fixed choices
for the relation between $b_{\phi}$ and the linear density bias $b_1$, we find
that $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}$ can vary by as much as an order of magnitude. Our
strongest bound is $f_{\rm NL} = 16 \pm 16\ (1\sigma)$, while the loosest is
$f_{\rm NL} = 230 \pm 226\ (1\sigma)$ for the same BOSS data. The impact of
$b_{\phi}$ can be especially pronounced because it can be close to zero. We
also show how marginalizing over $b_{\phi}$ with wide priors is not
conservative, and leads in fact to biased constraints through parameter space
projection effects. Independently of galaxy bias assumptions, the
scale-dependent bias effect can only be used to detect $f_{\rm NL} \neq 0$ by
constraining the product $f_{\rm NL}b_{\phi}$, but the error bar
$\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}$ remains undetermined and the results cannot be compared
with the CMB; we find $f_{\rm NL}b_{\phi} \neq 0$ with $1.6\sigma$
significance. We also comment on why these issues are important for analyses
with the galaxy bispectrum. Our results strongly motivate simulation-based
research programs aimed at robust theoretical priors for the $b_{\phi}$
parameter, without which we may never be able to competitively constrain
$f_{\rm NL}$ using galaxy data.

Title:Linking stellar populations to HII regions across nearby galaxies: I. Constraining pre-supernova feedback from young clusters in NGC1672,"
Abstract:  One of the fundamental factors regulating the evolution of galaxies is
stellar feedback. However, we still do not have strong observational
constraints on the relative importance of the different feedback mechanisms
(e.g. radiation, ionised gas pressure, stellar winds) in driving HII region
evolution and molecular cloud disruption. In this letter, we constrain the
relative importance of the various feedback mechanisms from young massive star
populations by resolving HII regions across the disk of the nearby star-forming
galaxy NGC 1672. We combine measurements of ionised gas nebular lines obtained
by PHANGS-MUSE, with high-resolution imaging from the HST in both the
narrow-band H{\alpha} and broad-band filters. We identify a sample of 40
isolated, compact HII regions in the HST H{\alpha} image, for which we measure
the sizes that were previously unresolved in seeing-limited ground-based
observations. Additionally, we identify the ionisation source(s) for each HII
region from catalogues produced as part of the PHANGS-HST survey. We find that
the HII regions investigated are mildly dominated by thermal or wind pressure,
yet their elevation above the radiation pressure is within the expected
uncertainty range. We see that radiation pressure provides a substantially
higher contribution to the total pressure than previously found in the
literature over similar size scales. In general, we find higher pressures
within more compact HII regions, which is driven by the inherent size scaling
relations of each pressure term, albeit with significant scatter introduced by
the variation in the stellar population properties (e.g. luminosity, mass, age,
metallicity). For nearby galaxies, here we provide a promising approach that
could yield the statistics required to map out how the importance of different
stellar feedback mechanisms evolve over the lifetime of an HII region.

parameters of stars that are effectively evolving in isolation. Starting from

curve models to verify the model fits and examine the TESS light curves, when
available, to select systems with evidence for additional physics, such as
spots, mass transfer, and hierarchical triples. We examine the distributions of
the eclipsing binary model parameters and the orbital parameters. We identify
two groups in the sum of the fractional radii and effective temperature ratio
parameter space that may distinguish systems approaching the semidetached
limit. Combining Gaia EDR3 with extinction estimates from 3-dimensional dust
maps, we examine the properties of the systems as a function of their absolute
magnitude and evolutionary state. Finally, we present light curves of selected
eclipsing binaries that may be of interest for follow-up studies.

Title:Wide twin binaries are extremely eccentric: evidence of twin binary formation in circumbinary disks,"
Abstract:  The Gaia mission recently revealed an excess population of equal-mass ""twin""
wide binaries, with mass ratio $q\gtrsim 0.95$, extending to separations of at
least 1000 AU. The origin of this population is an enigma: twin binaries are
thought to form via correlated accretion in circumbinary disks, but the typical
observed protostellar disks have radii of $\sim100$ AU, far smaller than the
separations of the widest twins. Here, we infer the eccentricity distribution
of wide twins from the distribution of their $v$-$r$ angles, i.e., the angle
between the components' separation and relative velocity vectors. We find that
wide twins must be on extremely eccentric orbits. For the excess-twin
population at 400-1000 AU, we infer a near-delta function excess of
high-eccentricity system, with eccentricity $0.95 \lesssim e \leq 1$. These
high eccentricities for wide twins imply pericenter distances of order $10$ AU
and suggest that their orbits were scattered via dynamical interactions in
their birth environments, consistent with a scenario in which twins are born in
circumbinary disks and subsequently widened. These results further establish
twin wide binaries as a distinct population and imply that wide twins can be
used as a probe of the dynamical history of stellar populations.

merger. We use three equations of state consistent with current pulsar
observations derived from a novel finite-temperature framework based on V-QCD,
a non-perturbative gauge/gravity model for Quantum Chromodynamics. In this way,
we identify three different post-merger stages at which mixed baryonic and
quark matter, as well as pure quark matter, are generated. A phase transition
triggered collapse already $\lesssim 10\,\rm{ms}$ after the merger reveals that
the softest version of our equations of state is actually inconsistent with the
expected second-long post-merger lifetime of GW170817. Our results underline
the impact that multi-messenger observations of binary neutron-star mergers can
have in constraining the equation of state of nuclear matter, especially in its

Title:SkyHopper mission science case I: Identification of high redshift Gamma-Ray Bursts through space-based near-infrared afterglow observations,"
Abstract:  Long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observations offer cutting-edge
opportunities to characterise the star formation history of the Universe back
to the epoch of reionisation, and to measure the chemical composition of
interstellar and intergalactic gas through absorption spectroscopy. The main
barrier to progress is the low efficiency in rapidly and confidently
identifying which bursts are high redshift ($z > 5$) candidates before they
fade, as this requires low-latency follow-up observations at near-infrared
wavelengths (or longer) to determine a reliable photometric redshift estimate.
So far this task has been performed by instruments on the ground, but sky
visibility and weather constraints limit the number of GRB targets that can be
observed and the speed at which follow-up is possible. In this work we develop
a Monte Carlo simulation framework to investigate an alternative approach based
on the use of a rapid-response near-infrared nano-satellite, capable of
simultaneous imaging in four bands from $0.8$ to $1.7\mu$m (a mission concept
called SkyHopper). We find that such a nano-satellite is capable of detecting
in the H band (1.6 $\mu$m) $72.5\% \pm 3.1\%$ of GRBs concurrently observable
with the Swift satellite via its UVOT instrument (and $44.1\% \pm 12.3\%$ of
high redshift ($z>5$) GRBs) within 60 minutes of the GRB prompt emission. This
corresponds to detecting $\sim 55$ GRB afterglows per year, of which 1-3 have
$z > 5$. These rates represent a substantial contribution to the field of
high-$z$ GRB science, as only 23 $z > 5$ GRBs have been collectively discovered
by the entire astronomical community over the last $\sim 24$ years.
Additionally, we find that launching a mini-constellation of 3 near-infrared
nano-satellites would increase the detection fraction of afterglows to $\sim
83\%$ and substantially reduce the latency in the photometric redshift
determination.

Title:Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets,"
Abstract:  Direct imaging and spectroscopy is the likely means by which we will someday
identify, confirm, and characterize an Earth-like planet around a nearby
Sun-like star. This Chapter summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding
discovering and characterizing exoplanets by direct imaging and spectroscopy.
We detail instruments and software needed for direct imaging detections and
summarize the current inventory of confirmed and candidate directly-imaged
exoplanets. Direct imaging and spectroscopy in the past decade has provided key
insights into jovian planet atmospheres, probed the demographics of the
outskirts of planetary systems, and shed light on gas giant planet formation.
We forecast the new tools and future facilities on the ground and in space that
will enhance our capabilities for exoplanet imaging and will likely image
habitable zone rocky planets around the nearest stars.

Title:VERTICO II: effects of HI-identified environmental mechanisms on molecular gas,"
Abstract:  In this VERTICO early science paper we explore in detail how environmental
mechanisms, identified in HI, affect the resolved properties of molecular gas
reservoirs in cluster galaxies. The molecular gas is probed using ALMA ACA
(+TP) observations of 12CO(2-1) in 51 spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster (of
which 49 are detected), all of which are included in the VIVA HI survey. The
sample spans a stellar mass range of 9 < log M*/Msol < 11. We study molecular
gas radial profiles, isodensity radii, and surface densities as a function of
galaxy HI deficiency and morphology. There is a weak correlation between global
HI and H2 deficiencies, and resolved properties of molecular gas correlate with
HI deficiency: galaxies that have large HI deficiencies have relatively steep
and truncated molecular gas radial profiles, which is due to the removal of
low-surface density molecular gas on the outskirts. Therefore, while the
environmental mechanisms observed in HI also affect molecular gas reservoirs,
there is only a moderate reduction of the total amount of molecular gas.

"Title:Proper Motions, Orbits, and Tidal Influences of Milky Way Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies","
Abstract:  We combine Gaia EDR3 astrometry with accurate photometry and utilize a
probabilistic mixture model to measure the systemic proper motion of 52 dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW). For the 46 dSphs
with literature line-of-sight velocities we compute orbits in both a MW and a
combined MW + Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) potential and identify Car II, Car
III, Hor I, Hyi I, Phx II, and Ret II as likely LMC satellites. 40% of our dSph
sample has a >25% change in pericenter and/or apocenter with the MW + LMC
potential. For these orbits, we Monte Carlo sample over the observational
uncertainties for each dSph and the uncertainties in the MW and LMC potentials.
We predict that Ant II, Boo III, Cra II, Gru II, and Tuc III should be be
tidally disrupting by comparing each dSph's average density relative to the MW
density at its pericenter. dSphs with large ellipticity (CVn I, Her, Tuc V, UMa
I, UMa II, UMi, Wil 1) show a preference for their orbital direction to align
with their major axis even for dSphs with large pericenters. We compare the
dSph radial orbital phase to subhalos in MW-like N-body simulations and infer
that there is not an excess of satellites near their pericenter. With
projections of future Gaia data releases, we find dSph orbital precision will
be limited by uncertainties in the distance and/or MW potential rather than
proper motion precision. Finally, we provide our membership catalogs to enable
community follow-up.

Title:A New Observational $H(z)$ Data from Full-Spectrum Fitting of Cosmic Chronometers in the LEGA-C Survey,"
Abstract:  In this work, we perform a full-spectrum fitting of 350 massive and passive
galaxies selected as cosmic chronometers from the LEGA-C ESO public survey to
derive their stellar ages, metallicities, and star-formation histories. We
extensively test our results by assessing their dependence on the possible
contribution of dust, calibration of noise and signal, and the use of
photometric data in addition to spectral information; we as well identify
indicators of the correct convergence of the results, including the shape of
the posterior distributions, the analysis of specific spectral features, and
the correct reproduction of the observed spectrum. We derive a clear
age-redshift trend compatible with the aging in a standard cosmological model,
showing a clear downsizing pattern, with more massive galaxies being formed at
higher redshift ($z_f\sim2.5$) with respect to lower massive ones ($z_f\sim2$).
From these data, we measure the differential aging of this population of cosmic
chronometers to derive a new measurement of the Hubble parameter, obtaining
$H(z=0.8) = 113.1 \pm 15.2 (\mathrm{stat.}) ^{+24.2}_{-4.0} (\mathrm{syst.})\
\mathrm{ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$. This analysis allows us for the first time to
compare the differential ages of cosmic chronometers measured on the same
sample with two completely different methods, the full-spectrum fit (this work)
and the analysis of Lick indices, known to correlate with the age and
metallicity of the stellar populations \citep{Borghi2022a}. Albeit an
understood offset in the absolute ages, the differential ages have proven to be
extremely compatible between the two methods, despite the very different data,
assumptions, and models considered, demonstrating the robustness of the method.

Title:Llamaradas Estelares: Modeling the Morphology of White-Light Flares,"
Abstract:  Stellar variability is a limiting factor for planet detection and
characterization, particularly around active M-type stars. Here we revisit one
of the most active stars from the Kepler mission, the M4 star GJ 1243, and use
a sample of 414 flare events from 11 months of 1-minute cadence light curves to
study the empirical morphology of white-light stellar flares. We use a Gaussian
process detrending technique to account for the underlying starspots. We
present an improved analytic, continuous flare template that is generated by
stacking the flares onto a scaled time and amplitude and uses a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo analysis to fit the model. Our model is defined using classical
flare events, but can also be used to model complex, multi-peaked flare events.
We demonstrate the utility of our model using TESS data at the 10-minute,
2-minute and 20-second cadence modes. Our new flare model code is made publicly
available on GitHub.

Title:Another Shipment of Six Short-Period Giant Planets from TESS,"
Abstract:  We present the discovery and characterization of six short-period, transiting
giant planets from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) --
TOI-1811 (TIC 376524552), TOI-2025 (TIC 394050135), TOI-2145 (TIC 88992642),
TOI-2152 (TIC 395393265), TOI-2154 (TIC 428787891), & TOI-2497 (TIC 97568467).
All six planets orbit bright host stars (8.9 <G< 11.8, 7.7 <K< 10.1). Using a
combination of time-series photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations
from the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) Working Group, we have
determined that the planets are Jovian-sized (R$_{P}$ = 1.00-1.45 R$_{J}$),
have masses ranging from 0.92 to 5.35 M$_{J}$, and orbit F, G, and K stars
(4753 $<$ T$_{eff}$ $<$ 7360 K). We detect a significant orbital eccentricity
for the three longest-period systems in our sample: TOI-2025 b (P = 8.872 days,
$e$ = $0.220\pm0.053$), TOI-2145 b (P = 10.261 days, $e$ =
$0.182^{+0.039}_{-0.049}$), and TOI-2497 b (P = 10.656 days, $e$ =
$0.196^{+0.059}_{-0.053}$). TOI-2145 b and TOI-2497 b both orbit subgiant host
stars (3.8 $<$ $\log$ g $<$4.0), but these planets show no sign of inflation
despite very high levels of irradiation. The lack of inflation may be explained
by the high mass of the planets; $5.35^{+0.32}_{-0.35}$ M$_{\rm J}$ (TOI-2145
b) and $5.21\pm0.52$ M$_{\rm J}$ (TOI-2497 b). These six new discoveries
contribute to the larger community effort to use {\it TESS} to create a
magnitude-complete, self-consistent sample of giant planets with
well-determined parameters for future detailed studies.

Title:Probing the $z\gtrsim6$ quasars in a universe with IllustrisTNG physics: Impact of gas-based black hole seeding models,"
Abstract:  We explore implications of a range of black hole (BH) seeding prescriptions
on the formation of the brightest $z\gtrsim6$ quasars in cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations. The underlying galaxy formation model is the same as
in IllustrisTNG. Using constrained initial conditions, we study the growth of
BHs in rare overdense regions (forming $\gtrsim10^{12}M_{\odot}/h$ halos by
$z=7$) using a $(9~\mathrm{Mpc}/h)^3$ simulated volume. BH growth is maximal
within halos that are compact and have a low tidal field. For these halos, we
consider an array of gas-based seeding prescriptions wherein
$M_{\mathrm{seed}}=10^4-10^6~M_{\odot}/h$ seeds are inserted in halos above
critical thresholds for halo mass and dense, metal-poor gas mass (defined as
$\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{h}}$ and $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}$, respectively, in
units of $M_{\mathrm{seed}}$). We find that a seed model with
$\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}=5$ and $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{h}}=3000$ successfully
produces a $z\sim6$ quasar with $\sim10^9~M_{\odot}$ mass and
$\sim10^{47}~\mathrm{ergs~s^ {-1}}$ luminosity. BH mergers play a crucial role
at $z\gtrsim9$, causing an early boost in BH mass at a time when
accretion-driven BH growth is negligible. When more stringent seeding
conditions are applied (for e.g., $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}=1000$), the
relative paucity of BH seeds results in a much lower merger rate. In this case,
$z\gtrsim6$ quasars can only be formed if we enhance the maximum allowed BH
accretion rates (by factors $\gtrsim10$) compared to the accretion model used
in IllustrisTNG. This can be achieved either by allowing for super-Eddington
accretion, or by reducing the radiative efficiency. Our results show that
progenitors of $z\sim6$ quasars have distinct BH merger histories for different
seeding models, which will be distinguishable with LISA observations.

Title:Investigating the nature and properties of MAXI J1810-222 with radio and X-ray observations,"
Abstract:  We present results from radio and X-ray observations of the X-ray transient
MAXI J1810-222. The nature of the accretor in this source has not been
identified. In this paper, we show results from a quasi-simultaneous radio and
X-ray monitoring campaign taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA), the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory X-ray telescope (XRT), and the Swift
Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). We also analyse the X-ray temporal behaviour using
observations from the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER).
Results show a seemingly peculiar X-ray spectral evolution of MAXI J1810-222
during this outburst, where the source was initially only detected in the soft
X-ray band for the early part of the outburst. Then, ~200 days after MAXI
J1810-222 was first detected the hard X-ray emission increased and the source
transitioned to a long-lived (~1.5 years) bright, harder X-ray state. After
this hard state, MAXI J1810-222 returned back to a softer state, before fading
and transitioning again to a harder state and then appearing to follow a more
typical outburst decay. From the X-ray spectral and timing properties, and the
source's radio behaviour, we argue that the results from this study are most
consistent with MAXI J1810-222 being a relatively distant ($\gtrsim$6 kpc)
black hole X-ray binary. A sufficiently large distance to source can simply
explain the seemingly odd outburst evolution that was observed, where only the
brightest portion of the outburst was detectable by the all-sky X-ray
telescopes.

Title:Ultra-wide Bandwidth Observations of 19 pulsars with Parkes telescope,"
Abstract:  Flux densities are basic observation parameters to describe pulsars. In the
most updated pulsar catalog, 24% of the listed radio pulsars have no flux
density measurement at any frequency. Here, we report the first flux density
measurements, spectral indices, pulse profiles, and correlations of the
spectral index with pulsar parameters for 19 pulsars employing the
Ultra-Wideband Low (UWL) receiver system installed on the Parkes radio
telescope. The results for spectral indices of 17 pulsars are in the range
between -0.6 and -3.10. The polarization profiles of thirteen pulsars are
shown. There is a moderate correlation between the spectral index and spin
frequency. For most pulsars detected, the S/N ratio of pulse profile is not
high, so DM, Faraday rotation measure (RM), and polarization can not be
determined precisely. Twenty-nine pulsars were not detected in our
observations. We discuss the possible explanations for why these pulsars were
not detected.

Title:High-resolution ALMA study of CO (2-1) line and dust continuum emissions in cluster galaxies at z = 1.46,"
Abstract:  We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) results
obtained from spatially resolved CO $J$=2-1 line ($0.4''$ resolution) and 870
$\mu$m continuum ($0.2''$ resolution) observations of cluster galaxies in
XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at $z=1.46$. Our sample comprises 17 galaxies within
$\sim0.5$ Mpc ($0.6R_{200}$) of the cluster center, all of which have
previously been detected in the CO $J$=2-1 line at a lower resolution. The
effective radii of both the CO $J$=2-1 line and 870 $\mu$m dust continuum
emissions are robustly measured for nine galaxies by modeling the visibilities.
We find that the CO $J$=2-1 line emission in all of the nine galaxies is more
extended than the dust continuum emission by a factor of $2.8\pm1.4$. We
investigate the spatially resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation in two
regions within the interstellar medium of the galaxies. The relation for our
sample reveals that the central region ($0<r<R_{e,{\rm 870\mu m}}$) of galaxies
tends to have a shorter gas depletion timescale, i.e., a higher star formation
efficiency, compared to the extended region ($R_{e,{\rm 870\mu m}}<r<R_{e,{\rm
CO}}$). Overall, our result suggests that star formation activities are
concentrated inside the extended gas reservoir, possibly resulting in the
formation of a bulge structure. We find consistency between the ALMA 870 $\mu$m
radii of star-forming members and the Hubble Space Telescope/1.6 $\mu$m radii
of passive members in a mass-size distribution, which suggests a transition
from star-forming to passive members within $\sim0.5$ Gyr. In addition, no
clear differences in the KS relation nor in the sizes are found between
galaxies with and without a close companion.

Title:Probing the Cosmic Dark Ages with the Lunar Crater Radio Telescope,"
Abstract:  The Cosmic Dark Ages represent the period in the early evolution of the
Universe, starting immediately after the decoupling of CMB photons from matter,
and ending with the formation of the first stars and galaxies. The HI signal
from the neutral hydrogen atoms is the only mechanism for us to understand this
crucial phase in the cosmological history of the Universe and answer
fundamental questions about the validity of the standard cosmological model,
dark matter physics, and inflation. Due to cosmological redshift, this signal
is now only observable in the 3-30~MHz frequency band, which is blocked from
reaching the surface of the Earth by the ionosphere. In this paper, we present
the design of the Lunar Crater Radio Telescope that intends to carry out
unprecedented measurements of this signal by deploying a kilometer-sized
parabolic reflector mesh inside a lunar crater on the far side of the Moon and
suspending a receiver at its focus.

Title:Neutrino mass and kinetic gravity braiding degeneracies,"
Abstract:  Modified theories of gravity yield an effective dark energy in the background
dynamics that achieves an accelerated expansion of the universe. In addition,
they present a fifth force that induces gravitational signatures in structure
formation, and therefore in the matter power spectrum and related statistics.
On the other hand, massive neutrinos suppress the power spectrum at scales that
also modified gravity enhances it, so a degeneration of these effects has been
recognized for some gravity models. In the present work, we study both effects
using kinetic gravity braiding (nKGB) models to find that in spite of some
degeneracies, the role of the fifth force at very large scales imprints a bump
in the matter power spectrum as a distinctive signature of this model and,
therefore, acts as a smoking gun that seems difficult to match within the
present knowledge of power spectra. These models result interesting, however,
since the n=1 presents no H0 tension, and all nKGB studied here present no
sigma8 tension and, in addition, a null neutrino mass is excluded.

Title:Probabilistic learning for pulsar classification,"
Abstract:  In this work, we explore the possibility of using probabilistic learning to
identify pulsar candidates. We make use of Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) and Deep
Kernel Learning (DKL). Trained on a balanced training set in order to avoid the
effect of class imbalance, the performance of the models, achieving relatively
high probability of differentiating the positive class from the negative one
($roc$-$auc \sim 0.98$), is very promising overall. We estimate the predictive
entropy of each model predictions and find that DKL is more confident than DGP
in its predictions and provides better uncertainty calibration. Upon
investigating the effect of training with imbalanced dataset on the models,
results show that each model performance decreases with an increasing number of
the majority class in the training set. Interestingly, with a number of
negative class $10\times$ that of positive class, the models still provide
reasonably well calibrated uncertainty, i.e. an expected Uncertainty
Calibration Error (UCE) less than $6\%$. We also show in this study how, in the
case of relatively small amount of training dataset, a convolutional neural
network based classifier trained via Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement
(BALD) performs. We find that, with an optimized number of training examples,
the model -- being the most confident in its predictions -- generalizes
relatively well and produces the best uncertainty calibration which corresponds
to UCE = $3.118\%$.

previously studied that also have \rfe\ (flux ratio parameter of UV \Feii\ to
\Mgii\ that is used as an accretion-rate proxy) measurements -- to
simultaneously constrain cosmological model parameters and QSO 2-parameter and
3-parameter radius-luminosity ($R-L$) relation parameters in six different
cosmological models. We find that these QSO $R-L$ relation parameters are
independent of the assumed cosmological model and so these QSOs are
standardizable through the $R-L$ relations. Also: (1) With the 2-parameter
$R-L$ relation, we find that the low-\rfe\ and high-\rfe\ data subsets obey the
same $R-L$ relation within the error bars. (2) Extending the 2-parameter $R-L$
relation to a 3-parameter one does not result in the hoped-for reduction in the
intrinsic dispersion of the $R-L$ relation. (3) Neither of the 3-parameter
$R-L$ relations provide a significantly better fit to the measurements than
does the 2-parameter $R-L$ relation. These are promising results for the
on-going development of \Mgii\ cosmological probes. The first and third of
these results differ significantly from those we found elsewhere from analyses

Title:Ejecta emplacement as the possible origin of Ryugu's equatorial ridge,"
Abstract:  The Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa 2 visited the asteroid (162173) Ryugu and
provided many high-resolution images of its surface, revealing that Ryugu has a
spinning-top shape with a prominent equatorial ridge, much like the shapes
reported for some other asteroids. In this study, through dozens of numerical
calculations, we demonstrate that during a period of fast rotation, ejecta from
craters formed at lower and mid-latitudes can be deposited on the equatorial
ridge. Assuming a rotation period of 3 h, we estimate that an equatorial ridge
with a height of 50 m can be generated in 128(+47 / -27) My for a main-belt
asteroid, or 3.1(+4.2 / -1.2) Gy for a near-Earth asteroid. Therefore, an
equatorial ridge can form within the average mean collisional lifetime of a
km-sized asteroid within the main belt, but not for near-Earth asteroids.
Furthermore, our model may explain why blue (younger) material occurs on the
equatorial ridge.

Title:The spatial distribution of impact craters on Ryugu,"
Abstract:  Asteroid 162173 Ryugu has numerous craters. The initial measurement of impact
craters on Ryugu, by Sugita et al. (2019), is based on Hayabusa2 ONC images
obtained during the first month after the arrival of Hayabusa2 in June 2018.
Utilizing new images taken until February 2019, we constructed a global impact
crater catalogue of Ryugu, which includes all craters larger than 20 m in
diameter on the surface of Ryugu. As a result, we identified 77 craters on the
surface of Ryugu. Ryugu shows variation in crater density which cannot be
explained by the randomness of cratering; there are more craters at lower
latitudes and fewer at higher latitudes, and fewer craters in the western bulge
(160 E - 290 E) than in the region around the meridian (300 E - 30 E). This
variation implies a complicated geologic history for Ryugu. It seems that the
longitudinal variation in crater density simply indicates variation in the
crater ages; the cratered terrain around the meridian seems to be geologically
old while the western bulge is relatively young. The latitudinal variation in
crater density suggests that the equatorial ridge of Ryugu is a geologically
old structure; however, this could be alternatively explained by a collision
with many fission fragments during a short rotational period of Ryugu in the
past.

abundance from the resonance Zn I 2138 A line, the subordinate lines, and the
lines of Zn II. In both stars, non-LTE leads to 0.17 dex higher average
abundance from Zn I, while, for Zn II lines, non-LTE corrections are minor and
do not exceed 0.06 dex. Using lines of Zn I in the high-resolution spectra, we
determined the non-LTE abundances for a sample of 80 stars in the -2.5 < [Fe/H]

[Zn/Fe] = 0.3 in the most metal-poor stars, a close-to-solar value for [Fe/H] =

"Title:VLBI observations of VIK J2318-3113, a quasar at z = 6.44","
Abstract:  The nature of jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe and
their feedback to the host galaxy remain a highly topical question.
Observations of the radio structure of high-redshift AGNs enabled by very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI) provide indispensable input into studies of
their properties and role in the galaxies' evolution. Up to now, only five AGNs
at redshift $z > 6$ have been studied with the VLBI technique. VIKJ2318-3113 is
a recently discovered quasar at z = 6.44 that has not been imaged with VLBI
before the current work. Here we present the first VLBI imaging results of this
high-redshift quasar, with the aim of corroborating its high-resolution
appearance with the physical model of the object. We carried out VLBI
phase-referencing observations of VIKJ2318-3113 using the Very Long Baseline
Array at two frequencies, 1.6 and 4.7 GHz, and obtained the first view at the
radio structure on the milliarcsecond scale. The source was clearly detected at
1.6 GHz. We found that almost all of its radio emission comes from the pc-scale
core region. Our dual-frequency observations constrain the spectral index and
brightness temperature of the radio core. Its properties are similar to those
of other known high-redshift radio-loud AGNs.

Title:Improved Sensitivity for Space Domain Awareness Observations with the Murchison Widefield Array,"
Abstract:  Our previously reported survey of the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment using
the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) detected over 70 unique Resident Space
Objects (RSOs) over multiple passes, from 20 hours of observations in passive
radar mode. In this paper, we extend this work by demonstrating two methods
that improve the detection sensitivity of the system. The first method, called
shift-stacking, increases the statistical significance of faint RSO signals
through the spatially coherent integration of the reflected signal along the
RSO's trajectory across the sky. This method was tested on the observations
used during our previous blind survey, and we obtained a $75\%$ increase in the
total number of detections. The second method re-focuses the MWA to the
near-field RSO's position (post-observation), by applying a complex phase
correction to each visibility to account for the curved wave-front. The method
was tested successfully on an MWA extended array observation of an ISS pass.
However, the method is currently limited by signal de-coherence on the
long-baselines (due to the hardware constraints of the current correlator). We
discuss the sensitivity improvement for RSO detections we expect from the MWA
Phase 3 correlator upgrade. We conclude the paper by briefly commenting on
future dedicated Space Domain Awareness (SDA) systems that will incorporate MWA
technologies.

Title:Searching for single-frame rapid X-ray transients detected with Chandra,"
Abstract:  We propose a new method to identify rapid X-ray transients observed with
focusing telescopes. They are statistically significant if three or more
photons are detected with Chandra in a single CCD frame within a
point-spread-function region. In the Chandra archive, 144 such events are
identified after discrimination of cosmic rays and background flares; 16 of
them are on top of a weak X-ray source and others emerge out of pure
background. Optical counterparts or host galaxies are found for some of them
thanks to the superb angular resolution of Chandra. Some events are spatially
coincident with normal stars in the Milky Way and are most likely produced by
stellar flares. They may represent a new class of stellar flares with short
durations (a few seconds), perhaps due to a compact flaring region. Some events
may be produced by X-ray binaries, with at least one credible identification.
This method would enable identification of quiescent X-ray binaries using
Chandra with only three photons. Some events are spatially coincident with
distant galaxies and could be produced by the prompt emission of short
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); this method would allow us to detect low-luminosity
170817A-like GRBs at a cosmological distance. Magnetars could also produce
rapid X-ray events but no identification can be claimed in this work.

Title:Full-Shape Galaxy Power Spectra and the Curvature Tension,"
Abstract:  With recent evidence for a possible ""curvature tension"" among early and late
universe cosmological probes, Effective Field Theories of Large Scale Structure
(EFTofLSS) have emerged as a promising new framework to generate constraints on
$\Omega_k$ that are independent of both CMB measurements, and some of the
assumptions of flatness that enter into other large-scale structure analyses.
In this work we use EFTofLSS to simultaneously constrain measurements from the
6dFGS, BOSS, and eBOSS catalogues, representing the most expansive full-shape
investigation of curvature to date. Fitting the full-shape data with a BBN
prior on $\Omega_b h^2$ and fixed $n_s$, we measure $\Omega_k =
-0.089^{+0.049}_{-0.046}$, corresponding to a $\sim 2 \sigma$ preference for
curvature. We argue that this result cannot be biased towards flatness by
assumptions in the fitting methodology. Using the Bayesian evidence ratio our
full-shape data assigns betting odds of 2:1 in favour of curvature, indicating
present measurements remain broadly compatible with both flat and curved
cosmological models. When our full-shape sample is combined with Planck 2018
CMB measurements, we break the geometric degeneracy and recover a joint fit on
$\Omega_k$ of $-0.0041^{+0.0026}_{-0.0021}$. Using the suspiciousness statistic
(built on the standard Bayes factor), we find evidence for a moderate tension
between Planck 2018 and our suite of full-shape measurements, at a significance
of $1.76 ^{+0.14}_{-0.11} \sigma$ ($p \sim 0.08 \pm 0.02$). These results
demonstrate the usefulness of full-shape clustering measurements as a CMB
independent probe of curvature in the ongoing curvature tension debate.

Title:Anti-glitches in accreting pulsars from superfluid vortex avalanches,"
Abstract:  Three sudden spin-down events, termed `anti-glitches', were recently
discovered in the accreting pulsar NGC 300 ULX-1 by the \textit{Neutron Star
Interior Composition Explorer} (NICER) mission. Unlike previous anti-glitches
detected in decelerating magnetars, these are the first anti-glitches recorded
in an accelerating pulsar. One standard theory is that pulsar spin-up glitches
are caused by avalanches of collectively unpinning vortices that transfer
angular momentum from the superfluid interior to the crust of a neutron star.
Here we test whether vortex avalanches are also consistent with the
anti-glitches in NGC 300 ULX-1, with the angular momentum transfer reversed. We
perform $N$-body simulations of up to $5 \times 10^{3}$ pinned vortices in two
dimensions in secularly accelerating and decelerating containers. Vortex
avalanches routinely occur in both scenarios, propagating inwards and outwards
respectively. The implications for observables, such as size and waiting time
statistics, are considered briefly.

Title:The Temporal and Spatial Behaviors of CME Occurrence Rate at Different Latitudes,"
Abstract:  The statistical study of the Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is a hot topic in
solar physics. To further reveal the temporal and spatial behaviors of the CMEs
at different latitudes and heights, we analyzed the correlation and phase
relationships between the occurrence rate of CMEs, the Coronal Brightness Index
(CBI), and the 10.7-cm solar radio flux (F10.7). We found that the occurrence
rate of the CMEs correlates with CBI relatively stronger at high latitudes
(>=60) than at low latitudes (<=50). At low latitudes, the occurrence rate of
the CMEs correlates relatively weaker with CBI than F10.7. There is a
relatively stronger correlation relationship between CMEs, F10.7, and CBI
during Solar Cycle 24(SC24) than Solar Cycle 23 (SC23). During SC23, the
high-latitude CME occurrence rate lags behind F10.7 by three months, and during
SC24, the low-latitude CME occurrence rate leads to the low-latitude CBI by one
month. The correlation coefficient values turn out to be larger when the very
faint CMEsare removed from the samples of the CDAW catalog. Based on our
results, we may speculate that the source regions of the high/low-latitude CMEs
may vary in height, and the process of magnetic energy accumulation and
dissipation is from the lower to the upper atmosphere of the Sun. The temporal
offsets between different indicators could help us better understand the
physical processes responsible for the solar-terrestrial interactions.

Title:Revisiting the Ulysses electron data with a triple fit of velocity distributions,"
Abstract:  Given their uniqueness, the Ulysses data can still provide us with valuable
new clues about the properties of plasma populations in the solar wind, and,
especially, about their variations with heliographic coordinates. We revisit
the electron data reported by by the SWOOPS instrument on-board of the Ulysses
spacecraft between 1990 to early 2008. These observations reveal velocity
distributions out of thermal equilibrium, with anisotropies (e.g., parallel
drifts or/and different temperatures, parallel and perpendicular to the
background magnetic field), and quasi-thermal and suprathermal populations with
different properties. We apply a 2D nonlinear least square fitting procedure,
using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, to simultaneously fit the velocity
electron data (up to a few keV) with a triple model combining three distinct
populations: the more central quasi-thermal core and suprathermal halo, and a
second suprathermal population consisting mainly of the electron strahl (or
beaming population with a major field-aligned drift). The recently introduced
$\kappa$-cookbook is used to describe each component with the following
anisotropic distribution functions (recipes): Maxwellian, regularized kappa-,
and generalized kappa-distributions. The temperature anisotropy quantified by
the best fits is considered as a case study of the main parameters
characterizing electron populations. By comparison to the core, both
suprathermal populations exhibit higher temperature anisotropies, which
slightly increase with the energy of electrons.

Title:A List of 49 New Stellar Twins from the Kepler Catalog of Eclipsing Binary Stars,"
Abstract:  49 new eclipsing twin binary candidates are identified and analyzed based on
Kepler eclipsing binary light curves. Their colours and spectral types are
calculated according to our classification. A comparison of the spectral type
distribution of eclipsing twin binary systems showed that F-type twins dominate
among others, which agrees well with recent studies. The distance of eclipsing
twin binaries from the galactic plane shows that F and G-type twins can be seen
at any distance from the galactic plane and most of the known eclipsing binary
twins are located within 200 pc of the galactic plane, which could be
interpreted as these systems are members of thin disk population. As a case
study, a twin binary system selected from our updated list of twins, V396~Gem,
has been analyzed with spectroscopic and Kepler data. As a result, we have
derived the physical parameters of the components of V396~Gem as
$M_{1,2}(M_\odot)= 1.814\pm0.114$, $1.797\pm0.114$; $R_{1,2}(R_\odot)=
2.655\pm0.078$, $2.659\pm0.090$; $T_{\mathrm{eff}_{1,2}}(K)=7000\pm100$,
$6978\pm100$; $[M/H]=0.11\pm0.03$. We have calculated the evolutionary status
of the components by using MESA. Accurately derived physical parameters of the
components of V396~Gem have allowed us to determine the age of the system as
1.168$\pm$0.149 Byrs.

Title:Gravitational wave matched filtering by quantum Monte Carlo integration and quantum amplitude amplification,"
Abstract:  The speedup of heavy numerical tasks by quantum computing is now actively
investigated in various fields including data analysis in physics and
astronomy. In this paper, we propose a new quantum algorithm for matched
filtering in gravitational wave (GW) data analysis based on the previous work
by Gao et al., Phys. Rev. Research 4, 023006 (2022) [arXiv:2109.01535]. Our
approach uses the quantum algorithm for Monte Carlo integration for the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculation instead of the fast Fourier transform
used in Gao et al. and searches signal templates with high SNR by quantum
amplitude amplification. In this way, we achieve an exponential reduction of
the qubit number compared with Gao et al.'s algorithm, keeping a quadratic
speedup over classical GW matched filtering with respect to the template
number.

Title:Benchmark tests of transmission spectroscopy using transiting white dwarfs,"
Abstract:  Ground-based transit observations are affected by both telluric absorption
and instrumental systematics. To account for these effects, a better
understanding of the impact of different data analyses is needed to improve the
accuracy of the retrieved transmission spectra. We propose validating
ground-based low-resolution transmission spectroscopy using transiting white
dwarfs. The advantage here is that we know beforehand what the final
transmission spectrum should be: a featureless flat spectrum. We analyzed two
transiting white dwarfs analogous to hot Jupiters. We used various noise models
to account for the systematic noise in their spectroscopic light curves
following common procedures of transmission spectroscopy analyses. We compared
the derived transmission spectra with the broadband transit depth to determine
whether there are any artificial offsets or spectral features arising from
light-curve fitting. The results show a strong model dependence, and the
transmission spectra exhibit considerable discrepancies when they are computed
with different noise models, different reference stars, and different
common-mode removal methods. Nonetheless, we can still derive relatively
accurate transmission spectra based on a Bayesian model comparison. With
current ground-based instrumentation, the systematics in transit light curves
can easily contaminate a transmission spectrum, introducing a general offset or
some spurious spectral features and thus leading to a biased interpretation on
the planetary atmosphere. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the
dependence of results on the adopted noise model through model comparison. The
model inferences should be examined through multiple observations and different
instruments. (Abridged)

Title:Sharp turns in axion monodromy: primordial black holes and gravitational waves,"
Abstract:  Large and sharp turns in multifield inflation can lead to a very rich
phenomenology, but are difficult to realise in supergravity, and typically
require large field space curvatures. In this work, we present a mechanism to
realise multiple sharp turns, and therefore strong non-geodesic trajectories,
from transient violations of slow-roll without the requirement of large field
space curvatures in supergravity inflation. Such turning rates can strongly
source the adiabatic fluctuations, resulting in an enhanced scalar power
spectrum with a large peak amplitude. If the growth of the scalar power
spectrum is large enough, primordial black holes can be produced in abundance.
Moreover, these large scalar fluctuations induce a characteristic large
spectrum of gravitational waves for a wide range of frequencies. We illustrate
this mechanism in a supergravity model of axion monodromy. The model can
sustain inflation for around 60 e-folds satisfying the cosmic microwave
background constraints at large scales, while leading to considerable
production of very light primordial black holes and large gravitational wave
spectra, potentially detectable by multiple upcoming gravitational wave
surveys.

Title:Particle acceleration in galactic wind bubbles,"
Abstract:  Winds are ubiquitous in galaxies and often feature bubble structures. These
wind bubbles are characterized by an external forward shock expanding in the
surrounding medium and a wind termination shock separating the cool and fast
wind from the hot shocked wind. While the forward shock could not be able to
accelerate particles efficiently for a long time, at the wind termination shock
the necessary conditions for efficient acceleration may be present. We develop
a model for particle acceleration at the termination shock of such bubbles
analysing the consequences of different possible engines powering the wind. We
finally explore the multi-messenger potential of galactic winds in terms of
escaping cosmic rays and high-energy gamma rays and neutrinos produced through
hadronic interactions.

range. Starting from a realistic generation of mock visibility data according
to the survey strategy, we reconstruct a map of the sky and perform a
foreground subtraction. We show that a survey of the North Celestial Polar cap
during a year of observing time and covering an area of $150 \, \mathrm{deg^2}$
would reach a sensitivity of $ 1.5-2 \, \mathrm{mK} $ per $1 \, \mathrm{MHz}
\times 0.25^2 \, \mathrm{deg^2 }$ voxel and be marginally impacted by
mode-mixing. Tianlai would be able to detect a handful $(\sim 10)$ of nearby
massive \HI clumps as well as a very strong cross-correlation signal of 21\,cm
intensity maps with the North Celestial Cap Survey optical galaxies. We have
also studied the performance of a mid-latitude survey, covering $\sim 1500 \,
\mathrm{deg^2}$ centered on a declination of $\delta=55^\circ$, which overlaps
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey footprint. Despite a higher noise level for the
mid-latitude survey, as well as significant distortions due to mode mixing,
Tianlai would be able to detect a highly significant cross-correlation between
the 21\,cm signal and the Sloan spectroscopic galaxy sample. Using the
extragalactic signals from either or both of these surveys, it will be possible
to assess the impact of calibration uncertainties, antenna pattern
uncertainties, sources of noise, and mode mixing for future surveys requiring
higher sensitivity.

Title:Molecular gas dynamics around nuclei of galaxies,"
Abstract:  Recent molecular line observations with ALMA in several nearby Seyferts have
revealed the existence of molecular tori, and the nature of gas flows at
10-20~pc scale. At 100~pc scale, or kpc-scale, previous NOEMA work on
gravitational torques had shown that only about one third of Seyfert galaxies
experienced molecular inflow and central fueling, while in most cases the gas
was stalled in rings. At higher resolution, i.e. 10-20~pc scale, it is possible
now to see in some cases AGN fueling due to nuclear trailing spirals,
influenced by the black hole potential. This brings smoking gun evidence for
nuclear fueling. In our sample galaxies, the angular resolution of up to 60~mas
allows us to reach the black hole (BH) sphere of influence and the BH mass can
be derived more directly than with the M-sigma relation.

Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope) DR5 and high resolution
asteroseismology data, mass and age are predicted by random forest method or
convex hull algorithm. The stellar parameters with high correlation with mass
and age are extracted and the test dataset shows that the median relative error
of the prediction model for the mass of large sample is 3\% and meanwhile, the
mass and age of red clump stars are 4\% and 7\%. We also compare the predicted
age of red clump stars with the recent works and find that the final
uncertainty of the RC sample could reach 18\% for age and 9\% for mass, in the
meantime, final precision of the mass for large sample with different type of
stars could reach 13\% without considering systematics, all these are implying
that this method could be widely used in the future. Moreover, we explore the
performance of different machine learning methods for our sample, including
bayesian linear regression (BYS), gradient boosting decision Tree (GBDT),
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest
(RF) and support vector regression (SVR). Finally we find that the performance
of nonlinear model is generally better than that of linear model, and the GBDT

Title:First-principle calculation of birefringence effects for in-ice radio detection of neutrinos,"
Abstract:  The detection of high-energy neutrinos in the EeV range requires new
detection techniques to cope with the small expected flux. The radio detection
method, utilizing Askaryan emission, can be used to detect these neutrinos in
polar ice. The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to
reconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected
radio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits
up the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly
different propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the
neutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino
direction to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from
first principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a
function of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF
waveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during
propagation into account. The model is available open-source through the
NuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from
the ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time
delay measurements, improving the predictions significantly compared to
previous studies. Finally, the implications and opportunities for neutrino
detection are discussed.

M$_\odot$ and a dynamic age of 990yr. The column density of H I is estimated to
be $7.1\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, which can be well explained in terms of a
photodissociation region around the ionized nebula, limited by self shielding
of H$_2$. We find that the atomic-to-ionized hydrogen ratio is 0.6, suggesting
that H I substantially contributes to overall nebular mass.

classical as well as machine learning techniques. In particular, our
atmospheric parameters agree significantly better with spectroscopic ones,

clouds with initial masses of $M_\text{cloud}=3.16 \times 10^{5}$ M$_\odot$
that (re)-collapse allowing for the birth of a second generation of stars. We
explore different star formation efficiencies in order to find the best set of
parameters that can reproduce the observation measurements. Our best-fit models
correspond to a first stellar generation with masses between $1.26 \times 10^4$
- $2.85 \times 10^4 $M$_\odot$ and for the second generation we find a $M
\approx 6.32\times 10^4$ M$_\odot$. Our models can match the observed stellar
ages, cloud shell radius, and the fact that the second generation of stars is
more concentrated than the first one. This is found independently of the
cluster starting initially with mass segregation or not. By comparing our
results with recent observational measurements of the mass segregation and
density profile of the central zone we find close agreement, and thus provide
supporting evidence for a centrally focused (re)-collapse origin to the

HST's unique capability as an absolute photometer to measure the ~0.2-1.7
$\mu$m sky surface brightness (SB) from 249,861 WFPC2, ACS, and WFC3 exposures
in ~1400 independent HST fields. SKYSURF's panchromatic dataset is designed to
constrain the discrete and diffuse UV to near-IR sky components: Zodiacal Light
(ZL; inner Solar System), Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs; outer Solar System),
Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), and the discrete plus diffuse Extragalactic
Background Light (EBL). We outline SKYSURF's methods to: (1) measure sky-SB
levels between its detected objects; (2) measure the integrated discrete EBL,
most of which comes from AB$\simeq$17-22 mag galaxies; and (3) estimate how
much diffuse light may exist in addition to the extrapolated discrete galaxy
counts. Simulations of HST WFC3/IR images with known sky-values and gradients,
realistic cosmic ray (CR) distributions, and star plus galaxy counts were
processed with nine different algorithms to measure the ""Lowest Estimated
Sky-SB"" (LES) in each image between the discrete objects. The best algorithms
recover the inserted LES values within 0.2% when there are no image gradients,
and within 0.2-0.4% when there are 5-10% gradients. SKYSURF requires
non-standard re-processing of these HST images that includes restoring the
lowest sky-level from each visit into each drizzled image. We provide a proof
of concept of our methods from the WFC3/IR F125W images, where any residual
diffuse light that HST sees in excess of the Kelsall et al. (1998) Zodiacal
model prediction does not depend on the total object flux that each image
contains. This enables us to present our first SKYSURF results on diffuse light

compact sources and sub-regions as well as the large scale properties of Sgr D

both regions than previously believed, and consequently both sources are not
powerful enough to be considered giant HII regions any longer. Motivated by
this, we revisit the census of giant HII regions, performing a search through
the last two decades of literature to update each source with the most recent
and/or most accurate distance measurements. Based on these new distance
estimates, we determine that 14 sources in total (25%) are at sufficiently
reliable and closer distances that they are not powerful enough to be

characteristics specific to Sgr D and W42 and show that they have properties

system, has long been a matter of some uncertainty. There is good reason to
suspect that it should be a metallic-line A-type star, and one study in
particular showed that this was so, but further studies have cast doubt on that
assessment. We utilized a simple spectral subtraction method between spectra
taken in and out of primary eclipse to reveal the light of Algol C in the
absence of the light from the brightest star. Our resultant spectrum is
well-matched to an F1 V spectroscopic standard and shows no evidence of
metallic-line spectral anomalies. We note that this classification matches
recent abundance determinations for this source.

Title:Superradiant evolution of the shadow and photon ring of Sgr A$^\star$,"
Abstract:  Ultralight bosons can affect the dynamics of spinning black holes (BHs) via
superradiant instability, which can lead to a time evolution of the
supermassive BH shadow. We study prospects for witnessing the
superradiance-induced BH shadow evolution, considering ultralight vector and
tensor fields. We introduce two observables sensitive to the shadow
time-evolution: the shadow drift, and the variation in the azimuthal angle
lapse associated to the photon ring autocorrelation. The two observables are
shown to be highly complementary, depending on the observer's inclination
angle. Focusing on the supermassive object Sgr A$^\star$ we show that both
observables can vary appreciably over human timescales of a few years in the
presence of superradiant instability, leading to signatures which are well
within the reach of the Event Horizon Telescope for realistic observation times
(but benefiting significantly from extended observation periods), and paving
the way towards probing ultralight bosons in the $\sim 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ mass
range.

Title:An Integrative Analysis of the Rich Planetary System of the Nearby Star e Eridani: Ideal Targets For Exoplanet Imaging and Biosignature Searches,"
Abstract:  e Eridani, the fifth-closest Sun-like star, hosts at least three planets and
could possibly harbor more. However, the veracity of the planet candidates in
the system and its full planetary architecture remain unknown. Here we analyze
the planetary architecture of e Eridani via DYNAMITE, a method providing an
integrative assessment of the system architecture (and possibly yet-undetected
planets) by combining statistical, exoplanet-population level knowledge with
incomplete but specific information available on the system. DYNAMITE predicts
the most likely location of an additional planet in the system based on the
Kepler population demographic information from more than 2000 planets.
Additionally, we analyze the dynamical stability of e Eridani system via N-body
simulations. Our DYNAMITE and dynamical stability analyses provide support for
planet candidates g, c, and f, and also predict one additional planet candidate
with an orbital period between 549 -- 733 days, in the habitable zone of the
system. We find that planet candidate f, if it exists, would also lie in the
habitable zone. Our dynamical stability analysis also shows that the e Eridani
planetary eccentricities, as reported, do not allow for a stable system,
suggesting that they are lower. We introduce a new statistical approach for
estimating the equilibrium and surface temperatures of exoplanets, based on a
prior on the planetary albedo distribution. e Eridani is a rich planetary
system with a possibility of containing two potentially habitable planets, and
its vicinity to our Solar System makes it an important target for future
imaging studies and biosignature searches.

Title:Solving the $H_{0}$ tension in $f(T)$ Gravity through Bayesian Machine Learning,"
Abstract:  Bayesian Machine Learning(BML) and strong lensing time delay(SLTD) techniques
are used in order to tackle the $H_{0}$ tension in $f(T)$ gravity. The power of
BML relies on employing a model-based generative process which already plays an
important role in different domains of cosmology and astrophysics, being the
present work a further proof of this. Three viable $f(T)$ models are
considered: a power law, an exponential, and a squared exponential model. The
learned constraints and respective results indicate that the exponential model,
$f(T)=\alpha T_{0}\left(1-e^{-pT/T_{0}}\right)$, has the capability to solve
the $H_{0}$ tension quite efficiently. The forecasting power and robustness of
the method are shown by considering different redshift ranges and parameters
for the lenses and sources involved. The lesson learned is that these values
can strongly affect our understanding of the $H_{0}$ tension, as it does happen
in the case of the model considered. The resulting constraints of the learning
method are eventually validated by using the observational Hubble data(OHD).

Title:Measurements of cosmic expansion and growth rate of structure from voids in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey between redshift 0.07 and 1.0,"
Abstract:  We present measurements of the anisotropic cross-correlation of galaxies and
cosmic voids in data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample
(MGS), Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and extended BOSS (eBOSS)
luminous red galaxy catalogues from SDSS Data Releases 7, 12 and 16, covering
the redshift range $0.07<z<1.0$. As in our previous work analysing voids in
subsets of these data, we use a reconstruction method applied to the galaxy
data before void-finding in order to remove selection biases when constructing
the void samples. We report results of a joint fit to the multipole moments of
the measured cross-correlation for the growth rate of structure,
$f\sigma_8(z)$, and the ratio $D_\mathrm{M}(z)/D_\mathrm{H}(z)$ of the comoving
angular diameter distance to the Hubble distance, in six redshift bins. For
$D_\mathrm{M}/D_\mathrm{H}$, we are able to achieve a significantly higher
precision than that obtained from analyses of the baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO) and galaxy clustering in the same datasets. Our growth rate measurements
are of lower precision but still comparable with galaxy clustering results. For
both quantities, the results agree well with the expectations for a
$\Lambda$CDM model. Assuming a flat Universe, our results correspond to a
measurement of the matter density parameter
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.337^{+0.026}_{-0.029}$. For more general models the
degeneracy directions obtained are consistent with and complementary to those
from other cosmological probes. These results consolidate void-galaxy
cross-correlation measurements as a pillar of modern observational cosmology.

Title:Doubly peaked induced stochastic gravitational wave background : Testing baryogenesis from primordial black holes,"
Abstract:  Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) can facilitate the
generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry. We focus on ultra-low mass PBHs that
briefly dominate the universe and evaporate before the big bang
nucleosynthesis. We propose a novel test of this scenario by detecting its
characteristic doubly peaked gravitational wave (GW) spectrum in future GW
observatories. Here the first order adiabatic perturbation from inflation and
from the isocurvature perturbations due to PBH distribution, source tensor
perturbations in second-order and lead to two peaks in the induced GW
background. These resonant peaks are generated at the beginning of standard
radiation domination in the presence of a prior PBH-dominated era. This unique
GW spectral shape would provide a smoking gun signal of non-thermal
baryogenesis from evaporating PBHs, which is otherwise impossible to test in
laboratory experiments due to the very high energy scales involved or the
feeble interaction of the dark sector with the visible sector.

Title:An Effective Bias Expansion for 21 cm Cosmology in Redshift Space,"
Abstract:  A near-future detection of the 21cm signal from the epoch of reionization
will provide unique opportunities to probe the underlying cosmology, provided
that such cosmological information can be extracted with precision. To this
end, we further develop effective field theory (EFT) inspired techniques for
the 21cm brightness temperature field during the epoch of reionization,
incorporating renormalized bias and a treatment of redshift space distortions.
Notably, we confirm that in redshift space, measures of the 21cm brightness,
e.g the power spectrum, should have irreducible contributions that lack a bias
coefficient and therefore contain direct, astrophysics-free information about
the cosmological density field; in this work, we study this effect beyond
linear order. To validate our theoretical treatment, we fit the predicted EFT
Fourier-space shapes to the THESAN suite of hydrodynamical simulations of
reionization at the field level, where the considerable number of modes
prevents overfitting. We find agreement at the level of a few percent between
the 21cm power spectrum from the EFT fits and simulations over the wavenumber
range $k \lesssim 0.8$ h/Mpc and neutral fraction $x_\mathrm{HI} \gtrsim 0.4$,
which is imminently measurable by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array
(HERA) and future experiments. The ability of the EFT to describe the 21cm
signal extends to simulations that have different astrophysical prescriptions
for reionization as well as simulations with interacting dark matter.

Title:The Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS): Tracing the circumnuclear star formation in the super-Eddington NLS1 Mrk 1044,"
Abstract:  The host galaxy conditions for rapid supermassive black hole growth are
poorly understood. Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies often exhibit high
accretion rates and are hypothesized to be prototypes of active galactic nuclei
(AGN) at an early stage of their evolution. We present VLT MUSE NFM-AO
observations of Mrk 1044, the nearest super-Eddington accreting NLS1. Together
with archival MUSE WFM data we aim to understand the host galaxy processes that
drive Mrk 1044's black hole accretion. We extract the faint stellar continuum
emission from the AGN-deblended host and perform spatially resolved emission
line diagnostics with an unprecedented resolution. Combining both MUSE WFM and
NFM-AO observations, we use a kinematic model of a thin rotating disk to trace
the stellar and ionized gas motion from 10$\,$kpc down to 30$\,$pc around the
nucleus. Mrk 1044's stellar kinematics follow circular rotation, whereas the
ionized gas shows tenuous spiral features in the center. We resolve a compact
star forming circumnuclear ellipse (CNE) that has a semi-minor axis of
306$\,$pc. Within this CNE, the gas is metal rich and its line ratios are
entirely consistent with excitation by star formation. With an integrated SFR
of $0.19 \pm 0.05 \,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ the CNE contributes 27% of
the galaxy-wide star formation. We conclude that Mrk 1044's nuclear activity
has not yet affected the circumnuclear star formation. Thus, Mrk 1044 is
consistent with the idea that NLS1s are young AGN. A simple mass budget
consideration suggests that the circumnuclear star formation and AGN phase are
connected and the patterns in the ionized gas velocity field are a signature of
the ongoing AGN feeding.

Title:Optical follow-up of the tick-tock massive black hole binary candidate,"
Abstract:  The observation of a population of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is key
for our complete understanding of galaxy mergers and for the characterization
of the expected gravitational waves (GWs) signal. However, MBHBs still remain
elusive with only a few candidates proposed to date. Among these,
SDSSJ143016.05+230344.4 ('tick-tock' hereafter) is the only candidate with a
remarkably well sampled light curve showing a clear reduction of the modulation
period and amplitude over three years of observations. This particular feature
has been claimed to be the signature of a MBHB that is about to merge (Jiang et
al. 2022). In this paper, we provide an optical follow-up of the tick-tock
source using the Rapid Eye Mount (REM) telescope. The decreasing luminosity
observed in our follow up is hardly explained within the binary scenario. We
speculate about an alternative scenario that might explain the observed light
curve through relativistic Lense-Thirring precession of an accretion disc
around a single massive black hole.

Title:Extreme mass ratio inspirals and tidal disruption events in nuclear clusters. I. Time dependent rates,"
Abstract:  In this paper we develop a computationally efficient, two-population,
time-dependent Fokker-Plank approach in the two dimensions of energy and
angular momentum to study the rates of tidal disruption events (TDEs), extreme
mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and direct plunges occurring around massive black
holes (MBHs) in galactic nuclei. We test our code by exploring a wide range of
the astrophysically relevant parameter space, including MBH masses, galaxy
central densities and inner density slopes. We find that mass segregation and,
more in general, the time dependency of the distribution function regulate the
event rate: TDEs always decline with time, whereas EMRIs and plunges reach a
maximum and undergo a subsequent nearly exponential decay. Once suitably
normalized, the rates associated to different choices of MBH mass and galaxy
density overlap nearly perfectly. Based on this, we provide a simple scaling
that allows to reproduce the time-dependent event rates for any MBH mass and
underlying galactic nucleus. Although our peak rates are in general agreement
with the literature relying on the steady-state (non-time dependent)
assumption, those can be sustained on a timescale that strongly depends on the
properties of the system. In particular this can be much shorter than a Gyr for
relatively light MBHs residing in dense systems. This warns against using
steady state models to compute global TDE, EMRI and plunge rates and calls for
a more sophisticated, time dependent treatment of the problem.

Title:An Improved Calibration of the Wavelength Dependence of Metallicity on the Cepheid Leavitt law,"
Abstract:  The Cepheid period-luminosity (PL) relation (or Leavitt law) has served as
the first rung of the most widely used extragalactic distance ladders and is
central to the determination of the local value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$).
We investigate the influence of metallicity on Cepheid brightness, a term that
significantly improves the overall fit of the distance ladder, to better define
its wavelength dependence. To this aim, we compare the PL relations obtained
for three Cepheid samples having distinct chemical composition (in the Milky
Way and Magellanic Clouds) and focusing on the use of improved and recent data
while covering a metallicity range of about 1 dex. We estimate the metallicity
effect (hereafter $\gamma$) in 15 filters from mid-infrared to optical
wavelengths, including 5 Wesenheit indices, and we derive a significant
metallicity term in all filters, in accord with recent empirical studies and
models, in the sense of metal-rich Cepheids being brighter than metal-poor
ones. We describe the contribution of various systematic effects in the
determination of the $\gamma$ term. We find no evidence of $\gamma$ changing
over the wavelength range 0.5 - 4.5 $\mu$m indicating the main influence of
metallicity on Cepheids is in their luminosity rather than color. We identify
factors which sharpen the empirical constraints on the metallicity term over
past studies including corrections for the depth of the Magellanic Clouds,
better calibrated Cepheid photometry, improved Milky Way extinction estimates
and revised and expanded metallicity measurements in the LMC.

Title:Brought to Light III: Colors of Disk and Clump Substructures in Dwarf Early-Type Galaxies of the Fornax Cluster,"
Abstract:  It has been well established that dwarf early-type galaxies (ETGs) can often
exhibit a complex morphology, whereby faint spiral arms, bars, edge-on disks or
clumps are embedded in their main, brighter diffuse body. In our first paper
(Brought to Light I: Michea et al. 2021), we developed a new method for
robustly identifying and extracting substructures in deep imaging data of dwarf
ETGs in the Virgo galaxy cluster. Here we apply our method to a sample of 23
dwarf ETGs in the Fornax galaxy cluster, out of which 9 have disk-like and 14
have clump-like substructures. According to Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) data, our
sample constitutes $12\%$ of all dwarf ETGs in Fornax brighter than
$\text{M}_{r}=-13$ mag, and contains all cases that unequivocally exhibit
substructure features. We use $g$ and $r$-band FDS images to measure the
relative contribution of the substructures to the total galaxy light and to
estimate their $g-r$ colors. We find that substructures typically contribute
$8.7\%$ and $5.3\%$ of the total galaxy light in the $g$ and $r$ bands,
respectively, within two effective radii. Disk substructures are usually found
in dwarf ETGs with redder global colors, and they can be either as red as or
bluer than their galaxy's diffuse component. In contrast, clump substructures
are found in comparatively bluer dwarf ETGs, and they are always bluer than
their galaxy's diffuse component. These results provide further evidence that
dwarf ETGs can hide diverse complex substructures, with stellar populations
that can greatly differ from those of the dominant diffuse light in which they
are embedded.

Title:Code Comparison for Fast Flavor Instability Simulation,"
Abstract:  The fast flavor instability (FFI) is expected to be ubiquitous in
core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. It rapidly shuffles neutrino
flavor in a way that could impact the explosion mechanism, neutrino signals,
mass outflows, and nucleosynthesis. The variety of initial conditions and
simulation methods employed in simulations of the FFI prevent an
apples-to-apples comparison of the results. We simulate a standardized test
problem using five independent codes and verify that they are all faithfully
simulating the underlying quantum kinetic equations under the assumptions of
axial symmetry and homogeneity in two directions. We quantify the amount of
numerical error in each method and demonstrate that each method is superior in
at least one metric of this error. We make the results publicly available to
serve as a benchmark.

Title:Binary Interaction Dominates Mass Ejection in Classical Novae,"
Abstract:  Recent observations suggest our understanding of mass loss in classical novae
is incomplete, motivating a new theoretical examination of the physical
processes responsible for nova mass ejection. In this paper, we perform
hydrodynamical simulations of classical nova outflows using the stellar
evolution code MESA. We find that, when the binary companion is neglected,
white dwarfs with masses >= 0.8 Msol successfully launch
radiation-pressure-driven optically thick winds that carry away most of the
envelope. However, for most of the mass loss phase, these winds are accelerated
at radii beyond the white dwarf's Roche radius assuming a typical cataclysmic
variable donor. This means that, before a standard optically thick wind can be
formed, mass loss will instead be initiated and shaped by the binary
interaction. An isotropic optically thick wind is only successfully launched
when the acceleration region recedes within the white dwarf's Roche radius,
which occurs after most of the envelope has already been ejected. The
interaction between these two modes of outflow -- a first phase of slow,
binary-driven, equatorially focused mass loss encompassing most of the mass
ejection and a second phase consisting of a fast, isotropic, optically thick
wind -- is consistent with observations of aspherical ejecta and signatures of
multiple outflow components. We also find that isolated lower-mass white dwarfs
<= 0.8 Msol do not develop unbound optically thick winds at any stage, making
it even more crucial to consider the effects of the binary companion on the
resulting outburst.

Title:Can Carbon Fractionation Provide Evidence for Aerial Biospheres in the Atmospheres of Temperate Sub-Neptunes?,"
Abstract:  The search for signs of life on other worlds has largely focused on
terrestrial planets. Recent work, however, argues that life could exist in the
atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptunes. Here, we evaluate the usefulness of
carbon dioxide isotopologues as evidence of aerial life. Carbon isotopes are of
particular interest as metabolic processes preferentially use the lighter
$^{12}$C over $^{13}$C. In principle, the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) will be able to spectrally resolve the $^{12}$C and $^{13}$C
isotopologues of CO$_{2}$, but not CO and CH$_{4}$. We simulated observations
of CO$_{2}$ isotopologues in the H$_{2}$-dominated atmospheres of our nearest
($< 40$ pc), temperate (equilibrium temperature of 250-350 K) sub-Neptunes with
M dwarf host stars. We find $^{13}$CO$_{2}$ and $^{12}$CO$_{2}$ distinguishable
if the atmosphere is H$_{2}$-dominated with a few percentage points of CO$_{2}$
for the most idealized target with an Earth-like composition of the two most
abundant isotopologues, $^{12}$CO$_{2}$ and $^{13}$CO$_{2}$. With a
Neptune-like metallicity of 100$\times$ solar and a C/O of 0.55, we are unable
to distinguish between $^{13}$CO$_{2}$ and $^{12}$CO$_{2}$ in the atmospheres
of temperate sub-Neptunes. If atmospheric composition largely follows
metallicity scaling, the concentration of CO$_{2}$ in a H$_{2}$-dominated
atmosphere will be too low to distinguish CO$_{2}$ isotopologues with JWST. In
contrast, at higher metallicities, there will be more CO$_{2}$, but the smaller
atmospheric scale height makes the measurement impossible. Carbon dioxide
isotopologues are unlikely to be useful biosignature gases for the JWST era.
Instead, isotopologue measurements should be used to evaluate formation
mechanisms of planets and exoplanetary systems.

Title:Gamma-Ray Bursts at TeV Energies: Theoretical Considerations,"
Abstract:  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous explosions in the Universe and
are powered by ultra-relativistic jets. Their prompt $\gamma$-ray emission
briefly outshines the rest of the $\gamma$-ray sky making them detectable from
cosmological distances. It is followed by, and sometimes partially overlaps
with, a similarly energetic but very broadband and longer-lasting afterglow
emission. While most GRBs are detected below a few MeV, over a hundred were
detected at high ($\gtrsim0.1\;$GeV) energies and several have now been
observed up to tens of GeV with the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT).
A new electromagnetic window in the very high energy (VHE) domain
($\gtrsim0.1\;$TeV) was recently opened with the detection of afterglow
emission in the $(0.1$\textendash$1)\,$TeV energy band by ground-based imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The emission mechanism for the VHE spectral
component is not fully understood, and its detection offers important
constraints for GRB physics. This review provides a brief overview of the
different leptonic and hadronic mechanisms capable of producing VHE emission in
GRBs. The same mechanisms possibly give rise to the high-energy spectral
component seen during the prompt emission of many \textit{Fermi}-LAT GRBs.
Possible origins of its delayed onset and long duration, well into the
afterglow phase, with implications for the emission region and relativistic
collisionless shock physics are discussed. Key results for using GRBs as ideal
probes for constraining models of extra-galactic background light and
intergalactic magnetic fields, as well as for testing Lorentz invariance
violation, are presented.

calculated a new ephemeris for each of the systems using our minimum times and
additional literature. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach was used to
determine the eclipse timing variation trends of the systems. We found a likely
orbital growth for V336 TrA and PS Boo; four other systems show a linear trend
in orbital period changes, which is most likely due to the accumulation of
measurement errors in their linear ephemeris parameters. The light curve
analysis was performed using the Physics of Eclipsing Binaries (PHOEBE) 2.3.59
version code with the MCMC approach. The absolute parameters of the systems
were calculated by using the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) parallax. The
positions of the systems were also depicted on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R)

relations for the mass-radius (M-R) relationships of contact binary systems.
There is also a strong relationship between the mass ratio and the radius ratio
in the W UMa systems for which we also provided a new relation. We compared the
M-R updated relationships in this study with seven systems in other studies
obtained using the spectroscopic method. In addition, we estimated some of the
absolute parameters for 1734 EW systems, based on the new relationships.

Abstract:  We present the first results from the HST Archival Legacy project ""SKYSURF.""
As described in Windhorst et al. 2022, SKYSURF utilizes the large HST archive
to study the diffuse UV, optical, and near-IR backgrounds and foregrounds in
detail. Here we utilize SKYSURF's first sky-surface brightness measurements to
constrain the level of near-IR diffuse Extragalactic Background Light (EBL).
Our sky-surface brightness measurements have been verified to an accuracy of
better than 1%, which when combined with systematic errors associated with HST,
results in sky brightness uncertainties of $\sim$2-4% $\simeq$ 0.005 MJy/sr in
each image. We put limits on the amount of diffuse EBL in three near-IR filters
(F125W, F140W, and F160W) by comparing our preliminary sky measurements of $>
30,000$ images to Zodiacal light models, carefully selecting the darkest images
to avoid contamination from stray light. In addition, we investigate the impact
that instrumental thermal emission has on our measurements, finding that it has
a limited impact on F125W and F140W measurements, whereas uncertainties in the
exact thermal state of HST results in significant uncertainties in the level of
astrophysical diffuse light in F160W images. When compared to the Kelsall et
al. (1998) Zodiacal model, an isotropic diffuse background of $30$ nW m$^{-2}$
sr$^{-1}$ remains, whereas using the Wright (1998) Zodiacal model results in no
discernible diffuse background. Based primarily on uncertainties in the
foreground model subtraction, we present limits on the amount of diffuse EBL of
29 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$, 40 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$, and 29 nW m$^{-2}$
sr$^{-1}$ for F125W, F140W, and F160W respectively. While this light is
generally isotropic, our modeling at this point does not distinguish between a
cosmological origin or a Solar System origin (such as a dim, diffuse, spherical
cloud of cometary dust).

kinetic energy, and $^{56}$Ni distribution in velocity, from gamma-ray line
observations. We simulate data from a small number of published SN Ia models
for a simple gamma-ray instrument, and measure their underlying properties from
straightforward analyses. Assuming spherical symmetry and homologous expansion,
we calculate exact line profiles for all $^{56}$Co and $^{56}$Ni lines at all
times, requiring only the variation of mass density and $^{56}$Ni mass fraction
with expansion velocity as input. By parameterizing these quantities, we
iterate the parameters to fit the simulated data. We fit the full profiles of
multiple lines, or we integrate over the lines and fit line fluxes only versus
time. Line profile fits are more robust, but in either case, we can recover
accurately the values of the aforementioned properties of the models simulated,
given sufficient signal-to-noise in the lines. A future gamma-ray mission with
line sensitivity approaching 10$^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ would measure
these properties for many SN Ia, and with unprecedented precision and accuracy
for a few per year. Our analyses applied to the reported $^{56}$Co lines from

revise former LDB ages in stellar associations in a consistent way, taking
advantage of the homogeneous \textit{Gaia} parallaxes as well as bolometric
luminosity estimations that do not rely on monochromatic bolometric
corrections. We studied nine open clusters and three moving groups
characterised by a previous determination of the LDB age. We gathered all the
available information from our data and the literature: membership, distances,
photometric data, reddening, metallicity, and surface gravity. We re-assigned
membership and calculated bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures
using distances derived from Gaia DR2 and multi-wavelength photometry for
individual objects around the former LDB. We located the LDB using a
homogeneous method for all the stellar associations. Finally, we estimated the
age by comparing it with different evolutionary models. We located the LDB for
the twelve stellar associations and derived their ages using several
theoretical evolutionary models. We compared the LDB ages among them, along
with data obtained with other techniques, such as isochrone fitting, ultimately
finding some discrepancies among the various approaches. Finally, we remark
that the 32 Ori MG is likely to be composed of at least two populations of
different ages.

Title:SN 1961V: A Pulsational Pair-Instability Supernova,"
Abstract:  We explore a variety of models in which SN~1961V, one of the most enigmatic
supernovae (SNe) ever observed, was a pulsational pair-instability supernova
(PPISN). Successful models reproduce the bolometric light curve of the
principal outburst and, in some cases, the emission one year before and several
years afterward. All models have helium-rich ejecta, bulk hydrogenic velocities
near 2000 km s$^{-1}$, and total kinetic energies from 4 to 8 $\times 10^{50}$
erg. Each eventually leaves behind a black hole remnant. Three subclasses of
PPISN models are explored, each with two different choices of carbon abundance
following helium burning. Carbon is an important parameter because shell carbon
burning can weaken the explosion. The three subclasses correspond to situations
where SN~1961V and its immediate afterglow were: a) a single event; b) the
first of two or more pulsational events separated by decades or centuries; or
c) the latter stages of a complex explosion that had already been going on for
a year or more. For the low carbon case, the main sequence mass for SN~1961V's
progenitor would have been 100 to 115 \Msun; its pre-SN helium core mass was 45
to 52 \Msun; and the final black hole mass, 40 to 45 \Msun. For the high-carbon
case, these values are increased by roughly 20 to 25\%. In some PPISN models, a
$\sim10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ star-like object could still be shining at the site
of SN~1961V, but it has more likely been replaced by a massive accreting black
hole.

Title:Gamma-ray observation towards the young massive star cluster NGC 6618 in the M17 region,"
Abstract:  Young massive clusters have been established as a new population of gamma-ray
sources and potential cosmic ray (CR) accelerators. In this paper, we report
the detection of gamma-ray emissions near the young star cluster NGC 6618,
which is one of the youngest star clusters in our Galaxy. The detected
gamma-ray emissions can be divided into two components. One component is
point-like and reveals harder spectrum, while the other is extended and with
softer spectrum. Such spectral features are significantly different from other
young massive clusters and may be due to the propagation effects of CRs
accelerated in NGC 6618.

Title:The Factory and the Beehive. IV. A Comprehensive Study of the Rotation X-ray Activity Relation in Praesepe and the Hyades,"
Abstract:  X-ray observations of low-mass stars in open clusters are critical to
understanding the dependence of magnetic activity on stellar properties and
their evolution. Praesepe and the Hyades, two of the nearest, most-studied open
clusters, are among the best available laboratories for examining the
dependence of magnetic activity on rotation for stars with masses lower than
$\approx 1\ M_{\odot}$. We present an updated study of the rotation X-ray
activity relation in the two clusters. We updated membership catalogs that
combine pre-Gaia catalogs with new catalogs based on Gaia Data Release 2. The
resulting catalogs are the most inclusive ones for both clusters: 1739 Praesepe
and 1315 Hyades stars. We collected X-ray detections for cluster members, for
which we analyzed, re-analyzed, or collated data from ROSAT, the Chandra X-ray
Observatory, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and XMM-Newton. We have
detections for 326 Praesepe and 462 Hyades members, of which 273 and 164,
respectively, have rotation periods, an increase of 6$\times$ relative to what
was previously available. We find that at $\approx$700 Myr, only M dwarfs
remain saturated in X-rays, with only tentative evidence for supersaturation.
We also find a tight relation between the Rossby number and fractional X-ray
luminosity $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ in unsaturated single members,
suggesting a power-law index between $-3.2$ and $-3.9$. Lastly, we find no
difference in the coronal parameters between binary and single members. These
results provide essential insight into the relative efficiency of magnetic
heating of the stars' atmospheres, thereby informing the development of robust
age-rotation-activity relations.

Title:The State of the White-Light Corona over the Minimum and Ascending Phases of Solar Cycle 25 -- Comparison with Past Cycles,"
Abstract:  We report on the state of the corona over the minimum and ascending phases of
Solar Cycle (SC) 25 on the basis of the temporal evolutions of its radiance and
of the properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as determined from
white-light observations performed by the SOHO/LASCO-C2 coronagraph. These
evolutions are further compared with those determined during the past two SC.
The integrated radiance of the K-corona and the occurrence rate of CMEs closely
track the indices/proxies of solar activity, prominently the total magnetic
field for the radiance and the radio flux for the CMEs, all undergoing a steep
increase during the ascending phase of SC 25. This increase is much steeper
than anticipated on the basis of the predicted quasi similarity between SC 25
and 24, and is confirmed by the recent evolution of the sunspot number. The
radiance reached the same base level during the minima of SC 24 and 25, but the
latitudinal extent of the streamer belt differed, being flatter during the
latter minimum and in fact more similar to that of the minimum of SC 23.
Phasing the descending branches of SC 23 and 24 led to a duration of SC 24 of
11.0 years, similar to that given by the sunspot number. In contrast, the base
level of the occurrence rate of CMEs during the minimum of SC 25 was
significantly larger than during the two previous minima. The southern
hemisphere is conspicuously more active than the northern one in agreement with
several predictions and the current evolution of the hemispheric sunspot
numbers. The mean apparent width of CMEs and the number of halo CMEs remains at
relatively large, constant levels throughout the early phase of SC 25 implying
the persistence of weak total pressure in the heliosphere. These results and
the perspective of a corona more active than anticipated are extremely
promising for the forthcoming observations by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar
Probe.

"Title:Shocking interactions of supernova remnants with atomic and molecular clouds -- the interplay between shocks, thermal instability and gravity in the large cloud regime","
Abstract:  Using the adaptive mesh refinement code MG, we perform 3D hydrodynamic
simulations of a supernova-cloud interaction in the ""large cloud regime"". The
cloud is initially atomic and evolving due to the thermal instability (TI) and
gravity. We study interactions in a ""pre-TI"" and ""post-TI"" stage when cold and
dense clumps are present, and compare these results to idealised shock-cloud
scenarios in the ""small cloud regime"", and a scenario without shocks. On
aggregate, the supernova disruption is significantly weaker than that from an
idealised shock due to the supernova impact being instantaneous, and not
continuous. In both supernova-cloud interactions, we observe two shocks impact
the cloud, followed by the development of a weak 10 km s$^{-1}$ upstream flow
on the cloud interface, and a global ambient pressure drop. When the cloud is
still atomic, it expands due to this drop. Additionally, the TI is triggered at
the front of the cloud, causing the formation of a cap-like structure with
clumps embedded inside. The upstream flow converges in this region, resulting
in a lobe-like cloud morphology. When the cloud is molecular, the transmitted
shock disrupts the inter-clump material and causes the clumps' outer envelopes
to expand slightly and form tail-like morphologies. These effects are less
pronounced than those in our shock-cloud scenarios, and more pronounced that
those in our un-shocked scenario. After 3.5 Myrs, the effects from the
supernova decay and the cloud returns to an almost indistinguishable state from
an un-shocked cloud, in spite of the global ambient pressure drop. In neither
supernova-cloud scenario do we see any local gravitational collapse.

Title:Simulations of astrometric planet detection in Alpha Centauri by intensity interferometry,"
Abstract:  Recent dynamical studies indicate that the possibility of an Earth-like
planet around $\alpha\;$Cen A or B should be taken seriously. Such a planet, if
it exists, would perturb the orbital astrometry by $<10 \ {\mu}\rm as$, which
is $10^{-6}$ of the separation between the two stars. We assess the feasibility
of detecting such perturbations using ground-based intensity interferometry. We
simulate a dedicated setup consisting of four 40-cm telescopes equipped with
photon counters and correlators with time resolution $0.1\,\rm ns$, and a sort
of matched filter implemented through an aperture mask. The astrometric error
from one night of observing $\alpha\;$Cen AB is $\approx0.5\,\rm mas$. The
error decreases if longer observing times and multiple spectral channels are
used, as $(\hbox{channels}\times\hbox{nights})^{-1/2}$.

Title:The cooling of the Central Compact Object in Cas A from 2006 to 2020,"
Abstract:  We report on the study of six Chandra observations (four epochs) of the
Central Compact Object (CCO) in the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant with the
ACIS instrument in the subarray mode. This mode minimizes spectrum-distorting
instrumental effects such as pileup. The data were taken over a time span ~ 14
years. If a non-magnetic carbon atmosphere is assumed for this youngest known
CCO, then the temperature change is constrained to be $\dot{T}=-2900\pm 600$ K
yr$^{-1}$ or $\dot{T}=-4500\pm 800 $ K yr$^{-1}$ ($1\sigma$ uncertainties) for
constant or varying absorbing hydrogen column density. These values correspond
to cooling rates of $-1.5 \pm 0.3$% per 10yr and $-2.3 \pm 0.4$% per 10yr,
respectively. We discuss an apparent increase in the cooling rate in the last
five years and the variations of the inferred absorbing hydrogen column
densities between epochs. Considered together, these changes could indicate
systematic effects such as caused by, e.g., an imperfect calibration of the
increasing contamination of the ACIS filter.

Title:The Morphology of the HD 163296 jet as a window on its planetary system,"
Abstract:  HD163296 is a Herbig Ae star which drives a bipolar knotty jet with a total
length of ~6000au. Strong evidence exists that the disk of HD163296 harbors
planets. Studies have shown that the presence of companions around jet-driving
stars could affect the morphology of the jets. This includes a `wiggling' of
the jet axis and a periodicity in the positions of the jet knots. In this study
we investigate the morphology (including the jet width and axis position) and
proper motions of the HD163296 jets, and use our results to better understand
the whole system.This study is based on optical integral-field spectroscopy
observations obtained with VLT/MUSE in 2017. Using spectro-images and position
velocity diagrams extracted from the MUSE data cube, we investigated the number
and positions of the jet knots. A comparison was made to X-Shooter data
collected in 2012 and the knot proper motions were estimated. The jet width and
jet axis position with distance from the star were studied from the extracted
spectro-images. We observe the merging of knots and identify two previously
undetected knots. Measurements of the jet axis position reveal a similar
pattern of deviation in all forbidden emission lines along the first 20 arc
seconds of the jets. This result is interpreted as being due to asymmetric
shocks and not due to a wiggling of the jet axis. The number of new knots
detected and their positions challenge the 16-year knot ejection periodicity
proposed in prior studies, arguing for a more complicated jet system than was
previously assumed. We use the non-detection of a jet axis wiggling to rule out
companions with a mass $>$0.1~\Msun\ and orbits between 1~au and 35~au. Any
object inferred at these distances using other methods must be a brown dwarf or
planet, otherwise it would have impacted the jet axis position. Both the
precession and orbital motion scenarios are considered.

Title:Eigenmode analysis of perurbations in the primordial medium at and before recombination,"
Abstract:  Anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background are thought to be due to
perturbations of the primordial medium, which, post recombination, lead to the
formation of galaxy clusters and galaxies. Aims: We analyse the perturbation
wave modes of the primordial medium at and before recombination, consisting of
a fully ionized baryonic plasma, a strong black body radiation field, and cold
dark matter. Methods: We use the linear perturbation theory of the relativistic
equations of motion, utilising a strict thermodynamic equilibrium model that
relates the radiation energy density to the plasma temperature. Results: It is
shown that a wave mode corresponding to the postulated baryon acoustic waves
exists with a phase velocity close to the speed of light, but the participation
of the dark matter in this mode is very small. Instead, the dark matter has its
own dominant mode in the form of gravitational collapse, with very little
participation by the baryonic plasma. Conclusions: In view of this very weak
coupling between baryons and dark matter, the initial conditions postulated for
computer simulations of large-scale structure and galaxy formation, which
assume that after recombination, when galaxy formation is getting underway,
baryon and dark matter density perturbations are spatially coincident in terms
of fractional amplitude, may be unjustified. In addition the possible
non-coincidence of baryon and dark matter perturbations at the last scattering
surface has implications for the analysis of cosmic microwave background
anisotropies.

Abstract:  The curious Galactic features near G357.2$-$0.2 were observed with the
MeerKAT radio interferometer array in the UHF and L bands (0.56--1.68 GHz).
There are two possibly related features: a newly identified faint heart-shaped
partial shell (the ""Heart""), and a series of previously known but now much
better imaged narrow, curved features (the ""Worm"") interior to the heart.
Polarized emission suggests that much of the emission is nonthermal and is
embedded in a dense plasma. The filaments of the worm appear to be magnetic
structures powered by embedded knots that are sites of particle acceleration.
The morphology of the worm broadly resembles some known pulsar wind nebulae
(PWNe) but there is no known pulsar or PWN which could be powering this
structure. We also present eROSITA observations of the field; no part of the
nebula is detected in X-rays, but the current limits do not preclude the
existence of a pulsar/PWN of intermediate spin-down luminosity.

Title:Ejecta distribution from impact craters on Ryugu: possible origin of the bluer units,"
Abstract:  Asteroid (162173) Ryugu was the first spinning-top-shaped asteroid to be
closely approached by a probe, the Hayabusa2 spacecraft, which sent numerous
high-resolution images of Ryugu to the Earth and revealed the nature of this
type of asteroid. One of the notable features of Ryugu is the equatorial ridge,
which is considered the result of rapid spin in the past. Despite the advanced
age of the ridge, indicated by the presence of numerous craters, the ridge
exhibits a bluish color, indicating that it is covered with fresh material. In
addition to Ryugu, many other asteroids have similar blue areas, which are
considered the result of ejecta emplacement. We examined the distribution of
ejecta blankets from actual craters on Ryugu to assess ejecta emplacement as a
possible origin of Ryugu's bluer units. We determined that when Ryugu's
rotation was fast, ejecta from craters formed at lower latitudes accumulated
along the equator, which may explain the bluish color of the equatorial ridge.
On the other hand, ejecta emplacement does not fully explain the bluish color
of Tokoyo Fossa, although we attempted to find the corresponding ejecta
blankets.

Title:Modelling stellar activity with Gaussian process regression networks,"
Abstract:  Stellar photospheric activity is known to limit the detection and
characterisation of extra-solar planets. In particular, the study of Earth-like
planets around Sun-like stars requires data analysis methods that can
accurately model the stellar activity phenomena affecting radial velocity (RV)
measurements. Gaussian Process Regression Networks (GPRNs) offer a principled
approach to the analysis of simultaneous time-series, combining the structural
properties of Bayesian neural networks with the non-parametric flexibility of
Gaussian Processes. Using HARPS-N solar spectroscopic observations encompassing
three years, we demonstrate that this framework is capable of jointly modelling
RV data and traditional stellar activity indicators. Although we consider only
the simplest GPRN configuration, we are able to describe the behaviour of solar
RV data at least as accurately as previously published methods. We confirm the
correlation between the RV and stellar activity time series reaches a maximum
at separations of a few days, and find evidence of non-stationary behaviour in
the time series, associated with an approaching solar activity minimum.

Title:Asteroseismology of the multiple stellar populations in the Globular Cluster M4,"
Abstract:  We present a new asteroseismic analysis of the stars in the Globular Cluster
(GC) M4 based on the data collected by the K2 mission. We report the detection
of solar-like oscillation in 37 stars, 32 red giant branch (RGB) and 6 red
horizontal branch (rHB) stars, the largest sample for this kind of study in GC
up to date. Combining information from asteroseismology and multi-band
photometry we estimate both the masses and the radii of our targets. Our
estimates are in agreement with independent sources, serving as a crucial
verification of asteroseismology in the low metallicity regime.
As M4 is an old GC, it hosts multiple stellar populations differing in
light-element abundances and in helium mass fraction. This generates a mass
difference between the populations along the RGB, which in the case of M4 is
estimated to be $0.017 M_\odot$. With this wealth of information we can assign
population membership and estimate the average mass of the stellar populations,
but the current uncertainties do not allow us to resolve this mass difference.
The population membership and the seismic data of RGB and HB stars, allow us,
however, to assess the integrated mass loss along the RGB of the first
generation stars in the cluster. We obtain $\rm \Delta M=0.227 \pm0.028
M_\odot$, in good agreement with independent estimates. Finally, we observe the
presence of a statistically significant mass-temperature gradient in the rHB
stars. This represents the first direct, model-independent observation of the
colour-temperature-mass correlation predicted by the theory.

Title:Influence of magnetic cycles on stellar prominences and their mass loss rates,"
Abstract:  Observations of rapidly-rotating cool stars often show coronal slingshot
prominences that remove mass and angular momentum when they are ejected. The
derived masses of these prominences show a scatter of some two orders of
magnitude. In order to investigate if this scatter could be intrinsic, we use a
full magnetic cycle of solar magnetograms to model the coronal structure and
prominence distribution in a young Sun, where we scale the field strength in
the magnetograms with angular velocity according to $ B \propto \Omega^{-1.32}
$. We reproduce both the observed prominence masses and their scatter. We show
that both the field strength and the field geometry contribute to the
prominence masses that can be supported and to the rate at which they are
ejected. Predicted prominence masses follow the magnetic cycle, but with half
the period, peaking both at cycle maximum and at cycle minimum. We show that
mass loss rates in prominences are less than those predicted for the stellar
wind. We also investigate the role of small-scale field that may be unresolved
in typical stellar magnetograms. This provides only a small reduction in the
predicted total prominence mass, principally by reducing the number of large
magnetic loops that can support slingshot prominences. We conclude that the
observed scatter in prominence masses can be explained by underlying magnetic
cycles.

Abstract:  We present a re-analysis of the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observing campaign for
the well-studied, X-ray-bright AGN MCG-06-30-15. In particular, we consider a
disc model with finite thickness. By fitting the disc reflection spectra in the
data, we obtain a black hole spin of 0.87--0.99 (90\% confidence range) after
taking the thickness of the disc into consideration. Spectral models with a
grid of mass accretion rate from 0 to $30\%\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ are calculated
for MCG-06-30-15. This result is obtained by considering a free disc reflection
fraction parameter $f_{\rm refl}$ and is consistent with previous measurements
based on razor-thin disc models. Besides, an isotropic, point-like geometry,
i.e. the `lamppost' geometry, is assumed for the corona in our model. We find
that such a geometry overestimates $f_{\rm refl}$ in the data. Therefore, thin
disc models with consistent `lamppost' values of $f_{\rm refl}$ provide a worse
fit than ones with a free $f_{\rm refl}$ parameter. We discuss possible reasons
for the discrepancy between the observed and theoretical values of $f_{\rm
refl}$ at the end of the paper. Modifications for the over-simplified lamppost
model might be needed when the thickness of the thin disc is considered in
future work.

Abstract:  Massive galaxy clusters are interesting astrophysical and cosmological study
objects, but are relatively rare. In the redshift range z = 0.25 to 0.5 which
is, for example, a favourable region for gravitational lensing studies, about
100 such systems are known. Most of them have been studied in X-rays. In this
paper we study the six remaining massive clusters in this redshift interval in
the highly complete CLASSIX survey which have so far not been observed with
sufficiently deep exposures in X-rays. With data from our new XMM-Newton
observations we characterise their structures, derive X-ray properties such as
the X-ray luminosity and intra-cluster medium temperature and estimate their
gas and total masses. We find that one cluster, RXCJ1230.7+3439, is dynamically
young with three distinct substructures in the cluster outskirts and
RXCJ1310.9+2157/RXCJ1310.4+2151 is a double cluster system. Mass determination
is difficult in the systems with substructure. We therefore discuss several
methods of mass estimation including scaling relations. In summary we find that
five of the six study targets are indeed massive clusters as expected, while
the last cluster RXCJ2116.2-0309 is a close projection of a distant and a
nearby cluster which has led to a previous overestimation of its mass. In the
XMM-Newton observation fields we also find three low redshift clusters close to
the targets which are also analysed and described here. In the field of
RXCJ2116.2-0309 we discover serendipitously a highly variable X-ray source

reconstruct the potential of minimally-coupled single scalar fields from an

examples. The infinite class of homospectral potentials depends on two free
parameters, the initial energy scale and the initial value of the field,
showing that in general it is impossible to reconstruct a unique potential from

explored by radiative transfer calculations to quantify the observational

into spirals and ring structures. Their images in millimeter wavelengths are
very similar to those observed with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array in some protoplanetary disks. We assume that clumpy accretion may be the

Title:The spatial distribution of satellites in galaxy clusters,"
Abstract:  The planar distributions of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way and
Andromeda have been extensively studied as potential challenges to the standard
cosmological model. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Millennium
simulation we extend such studies to the satellite galaxies of massive galaxy
clusters. We find that both observations and simulations of galaxy clusters
show an excess of anisotropic satellite distributions. On average, satellites
in clusters have a higher degree of anisotropy than their counterparts in
Milky-Way-mass hosts once we account for the difference in their radial
distributions. The normal vector of the plane of satellites is strongly aligned
with the host halo's minor axis, while the alignment with the large-scale
structure is weak. At fixed cluster mass, the degree of anisotropy is higher at
higher redshift. This reflects the highly anisotropic nature of satellites
accretion points, a feature that is partly erased by the subsequent orbital
evolution of the satellites. We also find that satellite galaxies are mostly
accreted singly so group accretion is not the explanation for the high
flattening of the planes of satellites.

Title:The Effect of Ocean Salinity on Climate and Its Implications for Earth's Habitability,"
Abstract:  The influence of atmospheric composition on the climates of present-day and
early Earth has been studied extensively, but the role of ocean composition has
received less attention. We use the ROCKE-3D ocean-atmosphere general
circulation model to investigate the response of Earth's present-day and
Archean climate system to low vs. high ocean salinity. We find that saltier
oceans yield warmer climates in large part due to changes in ocean dynamics.
Increasing ocean salinity from 20 g/kg to 50 g/kg results in a 71% reduction in
sea ice cover in our present-day Earth scenario. This same salinity change also
halves the pCO$_2$ threshold at which Snowball glaciation occurs in our Archean
scenarios. In combination with higher levels of greenhouse gases such as CO$_2$
and CH$_4$, a saltier ocean may allow for a warm Archean Earth with only
seasonal ice at the poles despite receiving 20% less energy from the Sun.

These data contain the objects' galactic space velocities and also their Gaia

straight line, referred to as PC $1'$, about which both the bona fide members
used to obtain the straight line and the candidate members used to test the

account of distances to PC $1'$ is consistent with the nature of the candidate
members in use. The spatial and kinematic measurements that backed their
inclusion in the 2017 compilation were of course from before the availability
of data from the Gaia mission. Moreover, their radial velocities at the time
were either unknown or estimated somewhat unreliably. We propose that PC $1'$
be added to the tool set for BPMG analyses and potentially extended to other
young stellar moving groups.

Title:Maximally informed Bayesian modelling of disc galaxies,"
Abstract:  Dissecting the underlying structure of galaxies is of main importance in the
framework of galaxy formation and evolution theories. While a classical
bulge+disc decomposition of disc galaxies is usually taken as granted, this is
only rarely solidly founded upon the full exploitation of the richness of data
arising from spectroscopic studies with integral field units. In this work we
describe a fully Bayesian estimation method of the global structure of disc
galaxies which makes use of the wealth of photometric, kinematic, and
mass-to-light ratio data, and that can be seen as a first step towards a
machine-learning approach, certainly needed when dealing with larger samples of
galaxies. Ours is a novel, hybrid line of action in tackling the problem of
galactic parameter estimation, neither purely photometric nor orbit-based.
Being rooted on a nested sampler, our code, which is available publicly as an
online repository, allows for a statistical assessment of the need for multiple
components in the dissecting process. As a first case-study the GPU-optimized
code is applied to the S0 galaxy NGC-7683, finding that in this galaxy a
pseudo-bulge, possibly the remnant of a bar-like structure, does exist in the
center of the system. These results are then tested against the publicly
available, orbit-based code DYNAMITE, finding substantial agreement.

Title:Dancing with the stars: Stirring up extraordinary turbulence in Galactic center clouds,"
Abstract:  Molecular clouds in the central molecular zone (CMZ) have been observed to
feature turbulent line widths that are significantly higher, and scale with
cloud size more steeply, than in the rest of the Milky Way. In the same
Galactic region, the stellar density is also much higher than in the rest of
the Milky Way, and the vertical stellar velocity dispersion is large, meaning
that even young stars are likely to cross the entire vertical extent of the CMZ
within their lifetimes. Here, we investigate whether interactions of CMZ
molecular clouds with crossing stars can account for the extraordinary
properties of observed turbulence in this part of the Galaxy. We calculated the
rate of energy deposition by stars crossing CMZ clouds due to (a) stellar winds
and (b) dynamical friction, and compared it to the rate of turbulence decay. We
calculated the predicted scaling of turbulence line width with cloud size in
each case. We find that energy deposition by stellar winds of crossing massive
stars can account for both the level and the scaling of CMZ cloud turbulence
with cloud size. We also find that the mechanism stops being effective at a
Galactocentric distance comparable to the CMZ extent. On the other hand, we
find that dynamical friction by crossing stars does not constitute a
significant driver of turbulence for CMZ clouds.

Title:Initial periods and magnetic fields of neutron stars,"
Abstract:  Initial distributions of pulsar periods and magnetic fields are essential
components of multiple modern astrophysical models. Not enough work has been
done to properly constrain these distributions using direct measurements. Here
we aim to fill this gap by rigorously analysing properties of young neutron
stars associated to supernova remnants. In order to perform this task, we
compile a catalogue of 56 neutron stars uniquely paired to supernova remnants
with known age estimate. Further, we analyse this catalogue using multiple
statistical techniques. We found that distribution of magnetic fields and
periods for radio pulsars are both well described using the log-normal
distribution. The mean magnetic field is $\log_{10} [B/\mathrm{G}] = 12.44$ and
standard deviation is $\sigma_B = 0.44$. Magnetars and central compact objects
do not follow the same distribution. The mean initial period is $\log_{10} P_0
[P / \mathrm{s}] = -1.04_{-0.2}^{+0.15}$ and standard deviation is $\sigma_p =
0.53_{-0.08}^{+0.12}$. We show that the normal distribution does not describe
the initial periods of neutron stars sufficiently well. Parameters of the
initial period distribution are not sensitive to the exact value of the braking
index.

Title:Observational constraints on stellar feedback in dwarf galaxies,"
Abstract:  Feedback to the interstellar medium (ISM) from ionising radiation, stellar
winds and supernovae is central to regulating star formation in galaxies. Due
to their low mass ($M_{*} < 10^{9}$\,M$_\odot$), dwarf galaxies are
particularly susceptible to such processes, making them ideal sites to study
the detailed physics of feedback. In this perspective, we summarise the latest
observational evidences for feedback from star forming regions and how this
drives the formation of 'superbubbles' and galaxy-wide winds. We discuss the
important role of external ionising radiation -- 'reionisation' -- for the
smallest galaxies. And, we discuss the observational evidences that this
feedback directly impacts galaxy properties such as their star formation
histories, metal content, colours, sizes, morphologies and even their inner
dark matter densities. We conclude with a look to the future, summarising the
key questions that remain unanswered and listing some of the outstanding
challenges for galaxy formation theories.

Title:New catalogue of dark-matter halo properties identified in MICE-GC -- I. Analysis of density profile distributions,"
Abstract:  Constraints on dark matter halo masses from weak gravitational lensing can be
improved significantly by using additional information about the morphology of
their density distribution, leading to tighter cosmological constraints derived
from the halo mass function. This work is the first of two in which we
investigate the accuracy of halo morphology and mass measurements in 2D and 3D.
To this end, we determine several halo physical properties in the MICE-Grand
Challenge dark matter only simulation. We present a public catalogue of these
properties that includes density profiles and shape parameters measured in 2D
and 3D, the halo centre at the peak of the 3D density distribution as well as
the gravitational and kinetic energies and angular momentum vectors. The
density profiles are computed using spherical and ellipsoidal radial bins,
taking into account the halo shapes. We also provide halo concentrations and
masses derived from fits to 2D and 3D density profiles using NFW and Einasto
models for halos with more than $1000$ particles ($\gtrsim 3 \times 10^{13}
h^{-1} M_{\odot}$). We find that the Einasto model provides better fits
compared to NFW, regardless of the halo relaxation state and shape. The mass
and concentration parameters of the 3D density profiles derived from fits to
the 2D profiles are in general biased. Similar biases are obtained when
constraining mass and concentrations using a weak-lensing stacking analysis. We
show that these biases depend on the radial range and density profile model
adopted in the fitting procedure, but not on the halo shape.

Title:The WISSH quasars project X. Discovery of a multi-component and highly-variable UV ultra-fast outflow in a z=3.6 quasar,"
Abstract:  We report on the variability of a multi-component broad absorption line (BAL)
system observed in the hyper-luminous quasar J1538+0855 at z=3.6. Observations
from SDSS, VLT, LBT and Subaru telescopes taken at five different epochs,
spanning 17 yr in the observed frame, are presented. We detect three (A, B, C)
CIV variable troughs exhibiting extreme velocities ($\sim$40,000-54,000 km
s$^{-1}$) similar to the ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) typically observed in the
X-ray spectra. The A component of the BAL UFO ($\rm v_{ufo}$ $\sim$0.17 c)
shows strength variations, while B ($\rm v_{ufo}$ $\sim$0.15 c) and C ($\rm
v_{ufo}$ $\sim$0.13 c) components show changes both in shape and strength,
appearing and disappearing at different epochs. In addition, during the last
observation on June 2021 the entire BAL system disappears. The variability
trends observed during the first two epochs (1.30 yr rest-frame) in the CIV,
SiIV, OVI and NV absorption spectral regions are the same for B and C troughs,
while the A component of the BAL varies independently. This suggests a change
in the ionization state of the absorbing gas for B and C components and
tangential motion for the A component, as causes of this temporal behavior.
Accordingly, it is possible to provide an upper limit for distance of the gas
responsible for the A component of $R\rm_{out}^{A}$$\le$58 pc, and in turn, a
kinetic power of $\dot{E}\rm_{K,ufo}$ $\le$5.2 $\times$ 10$^{44}$ erg
s$\rm^{-1}$. We also obtain $R\rm_{out}^{B,C}$ $\le$2.7 kpc for B and C
components, which implies an upper limit estimation of $\dot{E}\rm_{K,ufo}$
$\le$2.1$\times$10$^{46}$ erg s$\rm^{-1}$ and $\dot{E}\rm_{K,ufo}$
$\le$1.4$\times$10$^{46}$ erg s$\rm^{-1}$, respectively. Future spectral
monitoring with high-resolution instruments is mandatory to accurately
constrain physical properties of the BAL UFO discovered in the UV spectrum of

Title:The Universe is Brighter in the Direction of Our Motion: Galaxy Counts and Fluxes are Consistent with the CMB Dipole,"
Abstract:  An observer moving with respect to the cosmic rest frame should observe a
concentration and brightening of galaxies in the direction of motion and a
spreading and dimming in the opposite direction. The velocity inferred from
this dipole should match that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
temperature dipole if galaxies are on average at rest with respect to the CMB
rest frame. However, recent studies have claimed a many-fold enhancement of
galaxy counts and flux in the direction of the solar motion compared to the CMB
expectation, calling into question the standard cosmology. Here we show that
the sky distribution and brightness of extragalactic radio sources are
consistent with the CMB dipole in direction and velocity. We use the first
epoch of the Very Large Array Sky Survey combined with the Rapid Australian
Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder Continuum Survey to estimate the dipole via
several different methods, and all show similar results. Typical fits find a
$331^{+161}_{-107}$ km s$^{-1}$ velocity dipole with apex $(\ell,b) =
(271^{+55}_{-58}, 56^{+13}_{-35})$ in Galactic coordinates from source counts
and $399^{+264}_{-199}$ km s$^{-1}$ toward $(\ell,b) = (301^{+30}_{-30},
43^{+19}_{-17})$ from radio fluxes. These are consistent with the CMB-solar
velocity, 370 km s$^{-1}$ toward $(\ell,b) = (264, 48)$, and show that galaxies
are on average at rest with respect to the rest frame of the early universe, as
predicted by the canonical cosmology.

Title:Solar Energetic Particles: Spatial Extent and Implications of the H and He Abundances,"
Abstract:  One of the earliest indicators of the importance of shock acceleration of
solar energetic particles (SEPs) was the broad spatial extent of the ""gradual""
SEP events produced as the shock waves, driven by wide, fast coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), expand across the Sun with cross-field transport mediated by
the shocks. Contrasting ""impulsive"" SEP events, with characteristic
enhancements of 3He and of heavy elements, are now associated with magnetic
reconnection on open field lines in solar jets. However, large shock waves can
also traverse pools of residual impulsive suprathermal ions and jets can
produce fast CMEs that drive shock waves; in both cases shocks reaccelerate
ions with the ""impulsive"" abundance signatures as well as coronal plasma. These
more-complex events produce ""excess protons"" that identify this process, and
recently, differences in the distribution of 4He abundances have also been
found to depend upon the combination of seed population and acceleration mode.
Extreme differences in the 4He abundances may reflect underlying differences in
the abundances of the coronal regions being sampled by solar jets and,
surprisingly, SEP events where shock waves sample two seed-particle populations
seem to have about twice the 4He/O ratio of those with a single source.

Title:Satellite galaxies in groups in the CIELO Project I. Gas removal from galaxies and its re-distribution in the intragroup medium,"
Abstract:  We study the impact of the environment on galaxies as they fall in and orbit
in the potential well of a Local Group (LG) analogue, following them with high
cadence. The analysis is performed on eight disc satellite galaxies from the
CIELO suite of hydrodynamical simulations. All galaxies have stellar masses
within the range $[10^{8.1} - 10^{9.56}] M_{\sun} $h$^{-1}$. We measure tidal
torques, ram pressure and specific star formation rates (sSFR) as a function of
time, and correlate them with the amount of gas lost by satellites along their
orbits. Stronger removal episodes occur when the disc plane is oriented
perpendicular to the direction of motion. More than one peripassage is required
to significantly modify the orientations of the discs with respect to the
orbital plane. The gas removed during the interaction with the central galaxies
may be also found opposite to the direction of motion, depending on the orbital
configuration. Satellites are not totally quenched when the galaxies reach
their first peripassage, and continue forming about $10\%$ of the final stellar
mass after this event. The fraction of removed gas is found to be the product
of the joint action of tidal torque and ram pressure, which can also trigger
new star formation activity and subsequent supernova feedback.

Title:Resolving the Multiplicity of Exoplanet Host Stars in Gemini/NIRI Data,"
Abstract:  The majority of stars have one or more stellar companions. As exoplanets
continue to be discovered, it is crucial to examine planetary systems to
identify their stellar companions. By observing a change in proper motion,
companions can be detected by the acceleration they induce on their host stars.
We selected 701 stars from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA)
that have existing adaptive optics imaging data gathered with Gemini/NIRI. Of
these, we examined 21 stars known to host planet candidates and reduced their
archival NIRI data with Gemini's DRAGONS software. We assessed these systems
for companions using the NIRI images as well as Renormalized Unit Weight Error
values in Gaia and accelerations in the HGCA. We detected three known visible
companions and found two more systems with no visible companions but
astrometric measurements indicating likely unresolved companions.

Title:Calibration of Transition-edge Sensor (TES) Bolometer Arrays with Application to CLASS,"
Abstract:  The current and future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments fielding
kilo-pixel arrays of transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers require accurate
and robust gain calibration methods. We simplify and refactor the standard TES
model to directly relate the detector responsivity calibration and optical time
constant to the measured TES current $I$ and the applied bias current
$I_{\mathrm{b}}$. The calibration method developed for the Cosmology Large
Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) TES bolometer arrays relies on current versus
voltage ($I$-$V$) measurements acquired daily prior to CMB observations. By
binning Q-band (40GHz) $I$-$V$ measurements by optical loading, we find that
the gain calibration median standard error within a bin is 0.3%. We test the
accuracy of this ""$I$-$V$ bin"" detector calibration method by using the Moon as
a photometric standard. The ratio of measured Moon amplitudes between detector
pairs sharing the same feedhorn indicates a TES calibration error of 0.5%. We
also find that for the CLASS Q-band TES array, calibrating the response of
individual detectors based solely on the applied TES bias current accurately
corrects TES gain variations across time but introduces a bias in the TES
calibration from data counts to power units. Since the TES current bias value
is set and recorded before every observation, this calibration method can
always be applied to raw TES data and is not subject to $I$-$V$ data quality or
processing errors.

Title:On the Accuracy of Three-dimensional Kinematic Distances,"
Abstract:  Over the past decade, the BeSSeL Survey and the VERA project have measured
trigonometric parallaxes to approximately 250 massive, young stars using VLBI
techniques. These sources trace spiral arms over nearly half of the Milky Way.
What is now needed are accurate distances to such stars which are well past the
Galactic center. Here we analyze the potential for addressing this need by
combining line-of-sight velocities and proper motions to yield 3D kinematic
distance estimates. For sources within about 10 kpc of the Sun, significant
systematic uncertainties can occur, and trigonometric parallaxes are generally
superior. However, for sources well past the Galactic center, 3D kinematic
distances are robust and more accurate than can usually be achieved by
trigonometic parallaxes.

Title:The Origin and Evolution of Saturn: A Post-Cassini Perspective,"
Abstract:  The Saturn System has been studied in detail by the Cassini-Huygens Mission.
A major thrust of those investigations has been to understand how Saturn formed
and evolved and to place Saturn in the context of other gas giants and
planetary systems in general. Two models have been proposed for the formation
of the giant planets,the core accretion model and the disk instability model.
The heavy element enrichment, core size, and internal structure of Saturn,
compared to Jupiter strongly favor the core accretion model as for Jupiter. Two
features of the core accretion model that are distinct from the disk
instability model are the growth of a core with a mass several times that of
the Earth, followed by runaway collapse of gas onto the core once a mass
threshold is reached. The heavy element core grows slowly over millions of
years through accretion of cm-m sized pebbles, even larger bodies, and moon
sized embryos in the gaseous disk. The abundance pattern of heavy elements is
thus a key constraint on formation models. C, N, S, and P at Saturn are
presently known to varying degree of uncertainty. The He to H ratio in the
atmosphere is crucial for understanding heat balance, interior processes, and
planetary evolution, but present values at Saturn range from low to high,
allowing for a wide range of possibilities. While the very low values are
favored to explain excess luminosity, high values might indicate presence of
layered convection in the interior, resulting in slow cooling. Additional
insight into Saturn's formation comes from the unique data on the rings from
Cassini's Grand Finale orbits. While the solar system is the only analog for
the extra solar systems, detection of the alkali metals and water in giant
exoplanets is useful for understanding the formation and evolution of Saturn,
where such data are presently lacking.

Title:The secular growth of bars revealed by flat (peak + shoulders) density profiles,"
Abstract:  The major-axis density profiles of bars are known to be either exponential or
'flat'. We develop an automated non-parametric algorithm to detect flat
profiles and apply it to a suite of simulations (with and without gas). We
demonstrate that flat profiles are a manifestation of a bar's secular growth,
producing a 'shoulder' region (an overdensity above an exponential) in its
outskirts. Shoulders are not present when bars form, but develop as the bar
grows. If the bar does not grow, shoulders do not form. Shoulders are often
accompanied by box/peanut bulges, but develop separately from them and are
independent tracers of a bar's growth. They can be observed at a wide range of
viewing orientations with only their slope varying significantly with
inclination. We present evidence that shoulders are produced by looped x1
orbits. Since the growth rate of the bar moderately correlates with the growth
rate of the shoulder strength, these orbits are probably recently trapped.
Shoulders therefore are evidence of bar growth. The properties of the shoulders
do not, however, establish the age of a bar, because secondary buckling or
strong spirals may destroy shoulders, and also because shoulders do not form if
the bar does not grow much. In particular, our results show that an exponential
profile is not necessarily an indication of a young bar.

Title:Tidal dynamo in solar-like close binary stars,"
Abstract:  Thermal convection is commonly believed to be the energy source of stellar or
planetary dynamo. In this short paper we provide another possibility, namely
large-scale tidal flow. In close binary stars, say, solar-like stars with
orbital period at 2 or 3 days, large-scale tidal flow is comparable to or even
stronger than convective flow, and it can induce magnetic dynamo action. Based
on dynamo equation and tidal theory we estimate the magnetic energy induced by
large-scale tidal flow, which is proportional to the cube of orbital frequency.
Our estimation can be tested by the future spectropolarimetric observations and
numerical simulations for close binary stars.

Title:On LGRB progenitors: an approach from thermally-produced neutrinos,"
Abstract:  Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are the most intense electromagnetic (EM) sources in
the Universe. Long GRB (LGRB) correspond to those events with a typical prompt
emission of more than a few seconds. It is generally assumed that they are
originated after an implosion of a very massive star within a central compact
object engine that can be either a black hole (BH) or a rapidly-spinning
highly-magnetized neutron star (NS). Nevertheless, one of the most challenging
aspects of defining a unique model is that the progenitor remains initially
hidden for direct EM observation. In this work, we investigate the evolution of
thermally-produced neutrino properties in both GRB progenitors to provide an
alternative solution. We consider the characteristics of both progenitors and
the fireball scenario to calculate the oscillation probabilities within a
three-flavor admixture regime. Then we obtain the expected neutrino ratio and
we also estimate the number of events from these sources that could be detected
in the future Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) detector, considering a sample of
previously observed GRB with remarkably signs of being magnetar-produced. Our
findings indicate that examining the predicted neutrino rates result in an
additional mechanism to determine the type of progenitor associated with these
events. This is especially useful when, for instance, we cannot directly
observe an electromagnetic counterpart, such as so-called ""failed"" GRB with
hidden jets, or when light curve analysis is inconclusive.

Abstract:  We report on high resolution observations of recurrent fan-like jets by the
Goode Solar telescope (GST) in multi-wavelengths inside a sunspot group. The
dynamics behaviour of the jets is derived from the Ha line profiles.
Quantitative values for one well-identified event have been obtained showing a
maximum projected velocity of 42 km s^-1 and a Doppler shift of the order of 20
km s^-1. The footpoints/roots of the jets have a lifted center on the Ha line
profile compared to the quiet sun suggesting a long lasting heating at these
locations. The magnetic field between the small sunspots in the group shows a
very high resolution pattern with parasitic polarities along the inter-granular
lanes accompanied by high velocity converging flows (4 km s^-1) in the
photosphere. Magnetic cancellations between the opposite polarities are
observed in the vicinity of the footpoints of the jets. Along the
inter-granular lanes horizontal magnetic field around 1000 Gauss is generated
impulsively. Overall, all the kinetic features at the different layers through
photosphere and chromosphere favor a convection-driven reconnection scenario
for the recurrent fan-like jets, and evidence a site of reconnection between
the photosphere and chromosphere corresponding to the inter-granular lanes.

Title:Dark-siren Cosmology with Decihertz Gravitational-wave Detectors,"
Abstract:  Gravitational waves (GWs) originated from mergers of stellar-mass binary
black holes (SBBHs) are considered as dark sirens in cosmology since they
usually do not have electromagnetic counterparts. In order to study cosmos with
these events, we not only need the luminosity distances extracted from GW
signals, but also require the redshift information of sources via, say,
matching GW sky localization with galaxy catalogs. Based on such a methodology,
we explore how well decihertz GW detectors, DO-Optimal and DECIGO, can
constrain cosmological parameters. Using Monte-Carlo simulated dark sirens, we
find that DO-Optimal can constrain the Hubble parameter to ${\sigma_{H_0}} /
{H_0}\, \lesssim 0.2\%$ when estimating $H_0$ alone, while DECIGO performs
better by a factor of 6 with ${\sigma_{H_0}} / {H_0}\lesssim 0.03\%$. Such a
good precision of $H_0$ will shed light on the $H_0$ tension. For
multiple-parameter estimation, DECIGO can still reach a level of
${\sigma_{H_0}} / {H_0} \lesssim 5\%$. The reason why decihertz detectors
perform well is explained by their large numbers of SBBH GW events with good
distance and angular resolution.

Title:Dust release from cold ring particles as a mechanism of spoke formation in Saturn's rings,"
Abstract:  Spokes in Saturn's rings are radially-extended structures consisting of dust
grains. Although spacecraft and space telescope observations have revealed
various detailed features of the spokes and their time variation, their
formation mechanism is still under debate. Previous models examined charging
mechanisms to attempt at explaining dust release from cm-sized ring particles;
however, the attempt has been unsuccessful, because the electrostatic force
caused by such charging mechanisms is much weaker than the cohesive force
acting on dust grains at ordinary conditions in the ring environment. Here we
propose a novel model for the formation of the spokes, where the temperature
dependence of cohesion plays an essential role. Ring particles with a
temperature below 60K adsorb an O2 ring atmosphere, which facilitates release
of dust grains from them by a reduction in the cohesive force between the
grains and the particles on the morning ansa. Then, intense electrostatic
forces sufficient to overcome the cohesive force are generated on the surface
of ring particles and the released dust grains form the structure of spokes.
Our model explains observational features of the spokes including their
longitudinal location, lifetime, radial expansion velocity, and seasonality.

Title:Running Hubble constant from the SNe Ia Pantheon sample?,"
Abstract:  The mismatch between different independent measurements of the expansion rate

serious and pressing problem in cosmology. We investigate this tension
considering the dataset from the Pantheon sample, a collection of 1048 Type Ia
Supernovae (SNe Ia) with a redshift range $0<z<2.26$. We perform a binned
analysis in redshift to study if the $H_0$ tension also occurs in SNe Ia data.
Hence, we build equally populated subsamples in three and four bins, and we
estimate $H_{0}$ in each bin considering the $\Lambda$CDM and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM
cosmological models. We perform a statistical analysis via a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method for each bin. We observe that $H_0$ evolves with the
redshift, using a fit function $H_{0}(z)=\tilde{H}_{0} (1+z)^{-\alpha}$ with
two fitting parameters $\alpha$ and $\tilde{H}_{0}$. Our results show a
decreasing behavior of $H_0$ with $\alpha\sim 10^{-2}$ and a consistency with
no evolution between 1.2 $\sigma$ and 2.0 $\sigma$. Considering the $H_0$
tension, we extrapolate $H_{0}(z)$ until the redshift of the last scattering
surface, $z=1100$, obtaining values of $H_0$ consistent in 1 $\sigma$ with the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements by Planck. Finally, we discuss
possible $f(R)$ modified gravity models to explain a running Hubble constant
with the redshift, and we infer the form of the scalar field potential in the

Title:The intermediate-ionization lines as virial broadening estimators for Population A quasars,"
Abstract:  The identification of a virial broadening estimator in the quasar UV rest
frame suitable for black hole mass computation at high redshift has become an
important issue. We compare the HI Balmer H-beta line width to the ones of two
intermediate ionization lines: the Aliii 1860 doublet and the Ciii] 1909 line,
over a wide interval of redshift and luminosity (0 < z < 3.5; 43 < logL < 48.5
[erg a/]), for 48 sources belonging to the quasar population characterized by
mid-to-high values of the Eddington ratio (Population A). The present analysis
indicates that the line width of Aliii 1860 and H-beta are highly correlated,
and can be considered equivalent for most Population A quasars over five orders
of magnitude in luminosity; forCiii] 1909, multiplication by a constant
correction factor xi ~ 1.25 is sufficient to bring the FWHM of Ciii] in
agreement with the one of H-betaa. The statistical concordance between
low-ionization and intermediate-ionization lines suggests that they
predominantly arise from the same virialized part of the broad line region.
However, blueshifts of modest amplitude (few hundred km /s) with respect to the
quasar rest frame and an excess (~ 1.1) Aliii broadening with respect to H-beta
are found in a fraction of our sample. Scaling laws to estimate M_BH of high
redshift quasar using the Aliii and the Ciii] line widths have rms scatter ~

Abstract:  From recently-acquired, high-resolution images obtained by the Cassini
spacecraft, we examine the patterns and spatial distributions of rayed craters
on Dione. We identify 29 rayed craters with diameters larger than 2km on
Dione's surface. The density of rayed craters and theoretical cratering rates
indicate that the retention time for rays on Dione can be approximately 1-50
My. Such a short retention time is interpreted to be due to bombardment of
plasma and E-ring particles, as well as implantation of dark particles
(presumably the same dark material found on Hyperion, Iapetus, and other
saturnian satellites). We also find that when the ray system of Creusa crater
was formed, it extended over most of the surface of Dione. Later, the ray
system deposited on the trailing hemisphere might have been partially erased,
mostly due to implantation of dark particles, which may have also removed other
bright ray systems in that region. The pattern of Creusa's ray system implies
that the implantation of the dark material occurred more recent than both the
age of Creusa crater and the typical retention time for rays on Dione.

Title:To Sample or Not To Sample: Retrieving Exoplanetary Spectra with Variational Inference and Normalising Flows,"
Abstract:  Current endeavours in exoplanet characterisation rely on atmospheric
retrieval to quantify crucial physical properties of remote exoplanets from
observations. However, the scalability and efficiency of the technique are
under strain with increasing spectroscopic resolution and forward model
complexity. The situation becomes more acute with the recent launch of the
James Webb Space Telescope and other upcoming missions. Recent advances in
Machine Learning provide optimisation-based Variational Inference as an
alternative approach to perform approximate Bayesian Posterior Inference. In
this investigation we combined Normalising Flow-based neural network with our
newly developed differentiable forward model, Diff-Tau, to perform Bayesian
Inference in the context of atmospheric retrieval. Using examples from real and
simulated spectroscopic data, we demonstrated the superiority of our proposed
framework: 1) Training Our neural network only requires a single observation;
2) It produces high-fidelity posterior distributions similar to sampling-based
retrieval and; 3) It requires 75% less forward model computation to converge.
4.) We performed, for the first time, Bayesian model selection on our trained
neural network. Our proposed framework contribute towards the latest
development of a neural-powered atmospheric retrieval. Its flexibility and
speed hold the potential to complement sampling-based approaches in large and
complex data sets in the future.

Title:Geminga contribution to the cosmic-ray positron excess according to the gamma-ray observations,"
Abstract:  We attempt to interpret the cosmic-ray positron excess by injection from the
nearby pulsar Geminga, assuming a two-zone diffusion scenario and an injection
spectrum with a low energy cutoff. Since the high energy positrons and
electrons from Geminga can induce $\gamma$ rays via inverse Compton scattering,
we take into account the extended $\gamma$-ray observations around Geminga from
HAWC for $\sim 10$ TeV and from Fermi-LAT for $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV. According
to the extended $\gamma$-ray observation claimed by an analysis of Fermi-LAT
data, we find that Geminga could explain the positron excess for a $30\%$
energy conversion efficiency into positrons and electrons. However, based on
the constraint on the extended $\gamma$ rays given by another Fermi-LAT
analysis, positrons from Geminga would be insufficient to account for the
positron excess. A further robust analysis of Fermi-LAT data for the extended
$\gamma$ rays would be crucial to determine whether Geminga can explain the
positron excess or not.

Title:Timing of the faulting on the Wispy Terrain of Dione based on stratigraphic relationships with impact craters,"
Abstract:  The trailing hemisphere of Dione is characterized by the Wispy Terrain, where
it exhibits a hemispheric-scale network of extensional tectonic faults
superposed on the moon's cratered surface. The faults likely reflect past
endogenic activity and Dione's interior thermal history. Although fresh
exposures of pristine scarps indicate that the timing of the faulting is
relatively recent, the absolute age of the faulting remains uncertain. To
estimate the timing of the faulting, we investigated stratigraphic
relationships between impact craters and faults. Using high-resolution images
obtained by ISS cameras onboard the Cassini spacecraft, we investigated craters
with diameters exceeding or equal to 10 km that coincide spatially with the
faults, and classified the craters as crosscut craters or superposed craters.
As a result, at least 82% of the craters were interpreted as clear examples of
crosscut craters and 12% of the craters were interpreted to be candidates of
superposed craters, although stratigraphic relationships are often ambiguous.
The paucity of superposed craters and a predicted cratering rate indicate that
the faulting of the Wispy Terrain is 0.30-0.79 Ga. If 12-18% of the craters are
assumed to be superposed, the timing of the faulting could be in the range
0.30-0.79 Ga. However, it is possible that the faulting of the Wispy Terrain is
still ongoing.

Title:Measuring precise radial velocities on individual spectral lines. III. Dependence of stellar activity signal on line formation temperature,"
Abstract:  Context. To enable radial velocity (RV) precision on the order of ~0.1 m/s
required for the detection of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting solar-type stars,
the main obstacle lies in mitigating the impact of stellar activity. Aims. This
study investigates the dependence of derived RVs with respect to the formation
temperature of spectral line segments. Methods. Using spectral synthesis, we
compute for each observed wavelength point of unblended spectral lines the
stellar temperature below which 50% of the emergent flux originates. We can
then construct RV time series for different temperature ranges, using template
matching. Results. With HARPS-N solar data and HARPS $\alpha$ Cen B
measurements, we demonstrate on time intervals of prominent stellar activity
that the activity-induced RV signal has different amplitude and periodicity
depending on the temperature range considered. We compare the solar
measurements with simulated contributions from active surface regions seen in
simultaneous images, and find that the suppression of convective motion is the
dominant effect. Conclusions. From a carefully selected set of spectral lines,
we are able to measure the RV impact of stellar activity at various stellar
temperatures ranges. We are able to strongly correlate the effect of convective
suppression with spectral line segments formed in hotter temperature ranges. At
cooler temperatures, the derived RVs exhibit oppositely directed variations
compared to the average RV time series and stronger anti-correlations with
chromospheric emission.

Title:Constraining branon dark matter from observations of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the MAGIC telescopes,"
Abstract:  We present the first branon dark matter (DM) search in the very high-energy
gamma-ray band with observations of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Segue~1 carried
out by the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope system.
Branons are new degrees of freedom that appear in flexible brane-world models
corresponding to brane fluctuations. They behave as weakly interacting massive
particles, which are natural DM candidates. In the absence of a gamma-ray
signal in the Segue~1 data, we place constraints on the branon DM parameter
space by using a binned likelihood analysis. Our most constraining limit to the
thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section (at $95\%$ confidence level)
corresponds to $ \langle \sigma v \rangle \simeq 1.4 \times
10^{-23}~\text{cm}^{3}\text{s}^{-1} $ at a branon DM mass of $ \sim
0.7~\text{TeV}$.

Title:Massive core/star formation triggered by cloud-cloud collision: II High-speed collisions of magnetized clouds,"
Abstract:  We study the effects of the magnetic fields on the formation of massive,
self-gravitationally bound cores (MBCs) in high-speed cloud-cloud collisions
(CCCs). Extending our previous work (Sakre et al. 2021), we perform
magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the high-speed (20 - 40 km s$^{-1}$)
collisions between two magnetized (4 $\mu$G initially), turbulent clouds of
different sizes in the range of 7 - 20 pc. We show that a magnetic field effect
hinders the core growth, particularly after a short-duration collision during
which cores cannot get highly bound. In such a case, a shocked region created
by the collision rapidly expands to the ambient medium owing to the enhanced
magnetic pressure, resulting in the destruction of the highly unbound cores and
suppression of gas accretion to massive cores. This negative effect on the MBC
formation is a phenomenon not seen in the past hydrodynamic simulations of
similar CCC models. Together with our previous work, we conclude that the
magnetic fields provide the two competing effects on the MBC formation in CCC;
while they promote the mass accumulation into cores during a collision, they
operate to destroy cores or hinder the core growth after the collision. The
duration of collision determines which effect prevails, providing the maximum
collision speed for the MBC formation with given colliding clouds. Our results
agree with the observed trend among CCC samples in the corresponding column
density range; clouds with higher relative velocity require higher column
density for the formation of massive stars (Enokiya et al. 2021).

Title:Search for the Gravitational-wave Background from Cosmic Strings with the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array Second Data Release,"
Abstract:  We perform a direct search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave
background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings in the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array
second data release. We find no evidence for such an SGWB, and therefore place
$95\%$ confidence level upper limits on the cosmic string tension, $G\mu$, as a
function of the reconnection probability, $p$, which can be less than 1 in the
string-theory-inspired models. The upper bound on the cosmic string tension is
$G\mu \lesssim 5.1 \times 10^{-10}$ for $p = 1$, which is about five orders of
magnitude tighter than the bound derived from the null search of individual
gravitational wave burst from cosmic string cusps in the PPTA DR2.

addition, a change in the nature of SW interaction with the magnetosphere could
occur due to a decrease in the density, temperature, and IMF of the solar wind.

Title:Rapid localization of gravitational wave hosts with FIGARO,"
Abstract:  The copious scientific literature produced after the detection of GW170817
electromagnetic counterpart demonstrated the importance of a prompt and
accurate localization of the gravitational wave within the co-moving volume. In
this letter, we present FIGARO, a ready to use and publicly available software
that relies on Bayesian non-parametrics. FIGARO is designed to run in parallel
with parameter estimation algorithms to provide updated three-dimensional
volume localization information. Differently from any existing algorithms, the
analytical nature of the FIGARO reconstruction allows a ranking of the entries
of galaxy catalogues by their probability of being the host of a gravitational
wave event, hence providing an additional tool for a prompt electromagnetic
follow up of gravitational waves. We illustrate the features of FIGARO on
binary black holes as well as on GW170817. Finally, we demonstrate the
robustness of FIGARO by producing so-called pp-plots and we present a method
based on information entropy to assess when, during the parameter estimation
run, it is reasonable to begin releasing skymaps.

Abstract:  The Probabilistic Solar Particle Event foRecasting (PROSPER) model predicts
the probability of occurrence and the expected peak flux of Solar Energetic
Particle (SEP) events. Predictions are derived for a set of integral proton
energies (i.e. E$>$10, $>$30 and $>$100 MeV) from characteristics of solar
flares (longitude, magnitude), coronal mass ejections (width, speed) and
combinations of both. Herein the PROSPER model methodology for deriving the SEP
event forecasts is described and the validation of the model, based on archived
data, is presented for a set of case studies. The PROSPER model has been
incorporated into the new operational Advanced Solar Particle Event Casting
System (ASPECS) tool to provide nowcasting (short term forecasting) of SEP
events as part of ESA's future SEP Advanced Warning System (SAWS). ASPECS also

Title:Depletion of Moderately Volatile Elements by Open-System loss in the Early Solar Nebula,"
Abstract:  Rocky bodies of the inner solar system display a systematic depletion of the
""Moderately Volatile Elements"" (MVEs) that correlates with the expected
condensation temperature of their likely host materials under protoplanetary
nebula conditions. In this paper, we present and test a new hypothesis in which
open system loss processes irreversibly remove vaporized MVEs from high nebula
altitudes, leaving behind the more refractory solids residing much closer to
the midplane. The MVEs irreversibly lost from the nebula through these open
system loss processes are then simply unavailable for condensation onto
planetesimals forming even much later, after the nebula cooled, overcoming a
critical difficulty encountered by previous models of this type. We model open
system loss processes operating at high nebula altitudes, such as resulting
from disk winds flowing out of the system entirely, or layered accretion
directly onto the young sun. We find that mass loss rates higher than found in
typical T-Tauri disk winds, lasting short periods of time, are most
satisfactory, pointing to multiple intense early outburst stages. Using our
global nebula model, incorporating realistic particle growth and inward drift
for solids, we constrain how much the MVE depletion signature in the inner
region is diluted by the drift of undepleted material from the outer nebula. We
also find that a significant irreversible loss of the common rock-forming
elements (Fe, Mg, Si) can occur, leading to a new explanation of another
longstanding puzzle of the apparent ""enhancement"" in the relative abundance of
highly refractory elements in chondrites.

Title:The influence of Hickson-like compact group environment on galaxy luminosities,"
Abstract:  Compact groups of galaxies are devised as extreme environments where
interactions may drive galaxy evolution. In this work, we analysed whether the
luminosities of galaxies inhabiting compact groups differ from those of
galaxies in loose galaxy groups. We computed the luminosity functions of galaxy
populations inhabiting a new sample of 1412 Hickson-like compact groups of
galaxies identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16. We
observed a characteristic absolute magnitude for galaxies in compact groups
brighter than that observed in the field or loose galaxy systems. We also
observed a deficiency of faint galaxies in compact groups in comparison with
loose systems. Our analysis showed that the brightening is mainly due to
galaxies inhabiting the more massive compact groups. In contrast to what is
observed in loose systems where only the luminosities of Red (and Early)
galaxies show a dependency with group mass, luminosities of Red and Blue (also
Early and Late) galaxies in compact groups are affected similarly as a function
of group virial mass. When using Hubble types, we observed that Elliptical
galaxies in compact groups are the brightest galaxy population, and groups
dominated by an Elliptical galaxy also display the brightest luminosities in
comparison with those dominated by Spiral galaxies. Moreover, we show that the
general luminosity trends can be reproduced using a mock catalogue obtained
from a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. These results suggest that
the inner extreme environment in compact groups prompts a different
evolutionary history for their galaxies.

"Title:Predicting HCN, HCO + , multi-transition CO, and dust emission of star-forming galaxies: Constraining the properties of resolved gas and dust disks of local spiral galaxies","
Abstract:  The ISM is a turbulent, multi-phase, and multi-scale medium following scaling
relations. Analytical models of galactic gaseous disks need to take into
account the multi-scale and multi-phase nature of the interstellar medium. They
can be described as clumpy star-forming accretion disks in vertical hydrostatic
equilibrium, with the mid-plane pressure balancing the gravity of the gaseous
and stellar disk. ISM turbulence is taken into account by applying Galactic
scaling relations to the cold atomic and molecular gas phases. Turbulence is
maintained through energy injection by supernovae. With the determination of
the gas mass fraction at a given spatial scale, the equilibrium gas temperature
between turbulent heating and line cooling, the molecular abundances, and the
molecular line emission can be calculated. The resulting model radial profiles
of IR, H{\sc i}, CO, HCN, and HCO$^+$ emission are compared to THINGS,
HERACLES, EMPIRE, SINGS, and GALEX observations of 17 local spiral galaxies.
The Toomre parameter, which measures the stability against star formation
(cloud collapse), exceeds unity in the inner disk of a significant number of
galaxies. In two galaxies it also exceeds unity in the outer disk. Therefore,
in spiral galaxies $Q_{\rm tot}=1$ is not ubiquitous. The model gas velocity
dispersion is consistent with the observed H{\sc i} velocity dispersion where
available. Within our model HCN and HCO$^+$ is already detectable in relatively
low-density gas ($\sim 1000$~cm$^{-3}$). CO and HCN conversion factors and
molecular gas depletion time were derived. Both conversion factors are
consistent with values found in the literature. Whereas in the massive galaxies
the viscous timescale greatly exceeds the star formation timescale, the viscous
timescale is smaller than the star formation timescale within
$\rm{R}~\sim~2~\rm{R}_{\rm d}$, the disk scale length, in the low-mass
galaxies.

Title:Finite inflation in curved space,"
Abstract:  We investigate the effects of non-zero spatial curvature on cosmic inflation
in the light of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements from
the Planck 2018 legacy release and from the 2015 observing season of BICEP2 and
the Keck Array. Even a small percentage of non-zero curvature today would
significantly limit the total number of e-folds of the scale factor during
inflation, rendering just-enough inflation scenarios with a kinetically
dominated or fast-roll stage prior to slow-roll inflation more likely. Finite
inflation leads to oscillations and a cutoff towards large scales in the
primordial power spectrum and curvature pushes them into the CMB observable
window. Using nested sampling, we carry out Bayesian parameter estimations and
model comparisons taking into account constraints from reheating and horizon
considerations. We confirm the preference of CMB data for closed universes with
Bayesian odds of over $100:1$ and with a posterior on the curvature density
parameter of $\Omega_{K,0}=-0.051\pm0.017$ for a curvature extension of LCDM
and $\Omega_{K,0}=-0.031\pm0.014$ for Starobinsky inflation. Model comparisons
of various inflation models give similar results as for flat universes with the
Starobinsky model outperforming most other models.

Gamma-ray continuum, hard X-ray (HXR) and radio emissions during almost the

with energetic ions and nonthermal electrons that quasi-periodically
accelerated by the repetitive magnetic reconnection. The different
quasi-periods between Gamma-ray line and continuum/HXR/radio emissions indicate
an apparent difference in acceleration or propagation between energetic ions

Swift operation in 2004, significant X-ray variability in the 14-195 KeV band
is detected, with mild changes in the source spectrum. Spectral variations
became more eminent after 2013, following a softer-when-brighter trend. Using
the power spectral density method, we found that the observed hard X-ray photon
flux variations are consistent with a red-noise process of slope, $-1.3$ with
no evidence for a break in the PSD. We found a significant correlation between
hard X-ray and 230 GHz radio flux variations, with no time delay longer than 30
days. The temporal and spectral analysis rules out the ADAF
(advection-dominated accretion flow) model, and confirms that the hard X-ray
emission is produced in the inner regions of the radio jet.

Title:Selecting a complete sample of blazars in sub-millimetre catalogues,"
Abstract:  The \textit{Herschel} Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS),
that has covered about 642 sq. deg. in 5 bands from 100 to 500 $\mu\rm m$,
allows a blind flux-limited selection of blazars at sub-mm wavelengths.
However, blazars constitute a tiny fraction of H-ATLAS sources and therefore
identifying them is not a trivial task. Using the data on known blazars
detected by the H-ATLAS we have defined a locus for 500\,$\mu$m selected
blazars and exploited it to select blazar candidates in the H-ATLAS fields.
Candidates and known blazars in the H-ATLAS equatorial and South Galactic Pole
fields were followed up with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) or
with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and matched with existing
radio- and mm-catalogues to reconstruct the spectral behaviour over at least 6
orders of magnitude in frequency. We identified a selection approach that,
combining the information in the sub-mm and radio domains, efficiently singles
out genuine blazars. In this way, we identified a sample of 39 blazars brighter
than $S_{500\mu\rm m} = 35\,$mJy in the H-ATLAS fields. Tests made
cross-matching the H-ATLAS catalogues with large catalogues of blazar
candidates indicate that the sample is complete. The derived counts are
compared with model predictions finding good consistency with the C2Ex model
and with estimates based on ALMA data.

Abstract:  We carried out a cyanopolyyne line survey towards a large sample of HMSFRs
using the Shanghai Tian Ma 65m Radio Telescope (TMRT). Our sample consisted of
123 targets taken from the TMRT C band line survey. It included three kinds of
sources, namely those with detection of the 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser alone, with
detection of the radio recombination line (RRL) alone, and with detection of
both (hereafter referred to as Maser-only, RRL-only, and Maser-RRL sources,
respectively). We detected HC3N in 38 sources, HC5N in 11 sources, and HC7N in
G24.790+0.084, with the highest detection rate being found for Maser-RRL
sources and a very low detection rate found for RRL-only sources. Their column
densities were derived using the rotational temperature measured from the NH3
lines. And we constructed and fitted the far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy
distributions. Based on these, we derive their dust temperatures, H2 column
densities, and abundances of cyanopolyynes relative to H2. The detection rate,
the column density, and the relative abundance of HC3N increase from Maser-only
to Maser-RRL sources and decrease from Maser-RRL to RRL-only sources. This
trend is consistent with the proposed evolutionary trend of HC3N under the
assumption that our Maser-only, Maser-RRL, and RRL-only sources correspond to
massive young stellar objects, ultra-compact HII regions, and normal classical
HII regions, respectively. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of the
integrated line intensity and column density of HC3N and shock-tracing
molecules (SiO, H2CO) enabled us to find positive correlations between them.
This suggests that HC3N may be another tracer of shocks, and should therefore
be the subject of further observations and corresponding chemical simulations.
Our results indirectly support the idea that the neutral--neutral reaction
between C2H2 and CN is the dominant formation pathway of HC3N.

Abstract:  This is the second paper in a series of studies of the Coma cluster using the
\textit{SRG}/eROSITA X-ray data obtained in the course of the calibration and

the radio source 1253+275 (Radio Relic, RR hereafter). We show that the X-ray
surface brightness steepest gradient at $\sim 79'$ ($\sim 2.2\,{\rm Mpc}\approx
R_{200c}$) is almost co-spatial with the outer edge of RR, with an offset of
about $\sim 100-150~\rm{kpc}$ between the derived position of the shock front
and the brightest part of RR. As in several other relics, the Mach number of
the shock derived from the X-ray surface brightness profile ($M_X\approx 1.9$)
appears to be lower than needed to explain the slope of the integrated radio
spectrum in the DSA model ($M_R\approx 3.5$) if the magnetic field is uniform
and the radiative losses are fast. However, the shock geometry is plausibly
much more complicated than a spherical wedge centered on the cluster, given a
non-trivial correlation between radio, X-ray, and SZ images. While the
complicated shock geometry alone might bias $M_X$ low, we speculate on a few
other processes that can affect the $M_X$-$M_R$ relation, including a fine
structure of the shock that might be modified by the presence of non-thermal
filaments stretching across the shock. We also discuss the ""history"" of the
radio galaxy NGC4789 located ahead of the relic in the context of the
Coma-NGC4839 merger scenario.

compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM model has arisen. Here, by analysing the high
quality velocity dispersion profiles of 13 E0-type elliptical galaxies in the
SDSS-IV MaNGA sample and assuming a power-law function of radius $r$ for the
3-dimensional velocity dispersion in each galaxy, we report the RAR for E0-type
elliptical galaxies and we show that the resultant RAR has more than $5\sigma$
deviations from the RAR in late-type galaxies. This new RAR provides an
independent probe to falsify the existence of any universal acceleration scale
in galaxies. Our result significantly challenges those modified gravity
theories which suggest the existence of any universal acceleration scale.

Title:MOA-2019-BLG-008Lb: a new microlensing detection of an object at the planet/brown dwarf boundary,"
Abstract:  We report on the observations, analysis and interpretation of the
microlensing event MOA-2019- BLG-008. The observed anomaly in the photometric
light curve is best described through a binary lens model. In this model, the
source did not cross caustics and no finite source effects were observed.
Therefore the angular Einstein ring radius cannot be measured from the light
curve alone. However, the large event duration, t E about 80 days, allows a
precise measurement of the microlensing parallax. In addition to the
constraints on the angular radius and the apparent brightness I s of the
source, we employ the Besancon and GalMod galactic models to estimate the
physical properties of the lens. We find excellent agreement between the
predictions of the two Galactic models: the companion is likely a resident of
the brown dwarf desert with a mass Mp about 30 MJup and the host is a main
sequence dwarf star. The lens lies along the line of sight to the Galactic
Bulge, at a distance of less then4 kpc. We estimate that in about 10 years, the
lens and source will be separated by 55 mas, and it will be possible to confirm
the exact nature of the lensing system by using high-resolution imaging from
ground or space-based observatories.

Title:Web of resonances and possible path of evolution of the small Uranian satellites,"
Abstract:  Satellite systems around giant planets are immersed in a region of complex
resonant configurations. Understanding the role of satellite resonances
contributes to comprehending the dynamical processes in planetary formation and
posterior evolution. Our main goal is to analyse the resonant structure of
small moons around Uranus and propose different scenarios able to describe the
current configuration of these satellites. We focus our study on the external
members of the regular satellites interior to Miranda, namely Rosalind, Cupid,
Belinda, Perdita, Puck, and Mab, respectively. We use N-body integrations to
perform dynamical maps to analyse their dynamics and proximity to two-body and
three-body mean-motion resonances (MMR). We found a complicated web of
low-order resonances amongst them. Employing analytical prescriptions, we
analysed the evolution by gas drag and type-I migration in a circumplanetary
disc (CPD) to explain different possible histories for these moons. We also
model the tidal evolution of these satellites using some crude approximations
and found possible paths that could lead to MMRs crossing between pairs of
moons. Finally, our simulations show that each mechanism can generate
significant satellite radial drift leading to possible resonant capture,
depending on the distances and sizes.

Title:Towards on-sky adaptive optics control using reinforcement learning,"
Abstract:  The direct imaging of potentially habitable Exoplanets is one prime science
case for the next generation of high contrast imaging instruments on
ground-based extremely large telescopes. To reach this demanding science goal,
the instruments are equipped with eXtreme Adaptive Optics (XAO) systems which
will control thousands of actuators at a framerate of kilohertz to several
kilohertz. Most of the habitable exoplanets are located at small angular
separations from their host stars, where the current XAO systems' control laws
leave strong residuals.Current AO control strategies like static matrix-based
wavefront reconstruction and integrator control suffer from temporal delay
error and are sensitive to mis-registration, i.e., to dynamic variations of the
control system geometry. We aim to produce control methods that cope with these
limitations, provide a significantly improved AO correction and, therefore,
reduce the residual flux in the coronagraphic point spread function.
We extend previous work in Reinforcement Learning for AO. The improved
method, called PO4AO, learns a dynamics model and optimizes a control neural
network, called a policy. We introduce the method and study it through
numerical simulations of XAO with Pyramid wavefront sensing for the 8-m and
40-m telescope aperture cases. We further implemented PO4AO and carried out
experiments in a laboratory environment using MagAO-X at the Steward
laboratory. PO4AO provides the desired performance by improving the
coronagraphic contrast in numerical simulations by factors 3-5 within the
control region of DM and Pyramid WFS, in simulation and in the laboratory. The
presented method is also quick to train, i.e., on timescales of typically 5-10
seconds, and the inference time is sufficiently small (< ms) to be used in
real-time control for XAO with currently available hardware even for extremely
large telescopes.

Title:A new galaxy spectral energy distribution model consistent with the evolution of dust,"
Abstract:  The spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies provides fundamental
information on the related physical processes. However, the SED is
significantly affected by dust in its interstellar medium. Dust is mainly
produced by asymptotic giant branch stars and Type II supernovae. In addition,
the dust mass increases through the metal accretion, and the grain size changes
by the collisions between the grains. The contribution of each process and the
extinction depend on the size distribution. Therefore, the SED model should
treat the evolution of the dust mass and size distribution. In spite of the
importance of dust evolution, many previous SED models have not considered the
evolution of the total mass and size distribution in a physically consistent
manner. In this work, we constructed a new radiative transfer SED model, based
on our dust evolution model consistent with the chemical evolution. To reduce
the computational cost, we adopted the mega-grain and the one-dimensional plane
parallel galaxy approximation. As a fiducial case, we calculated Milky Way-like
galaxy SEDs at various ages under the closed-box model. We found that a galaxy
at the age of 100~Myr does not produce small grains such as polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. After 1~Gyr, we observed a drastic increase of infrared emission
and attenuation caused by a rapid increase of dust mass. This phenomenon can be
treated appropriately for the first time by our new model. This model can be
used for the SED fitting to a galaxy at any stage of evolution.

Title:The young stars in the Galactic Center,"
Abstract:  We present a large ${\sim 30"" \times 30""}$ spectroscopic survey of the
Galactic Center using the SINFONI IFU at the VLT. Combining observations of the
last two decades we compile spectra of over $2800$ stars. Using the
Bracket-$\gamma$ absorption lines we identify $195$ young stars, extending the
list of known young stars by $79$. In order to explore the angular momentum
distribution of the young stars, we introduce an isotropic cluster prior. This
prior reproduces an isotropic cluster in a mathematically exact way, which we
test through numerical simulations. We calculate the posterior angular momentum
space as function of projected separation from Sgr~A*. We find that the
observed young star distribution is substantially different from an isotropic
cluster. We identify the previously reported feature of the clockwise disk and
find that its angular momentum changes as function of separation from the black
hole, and thus confirm a warp of the clockwise disk ($p \sim 99.2\%$). At large
separations, we discover three prominent overdensities of angular momentum. One
overdensity has been reported previously, the counter-clockwise disk. The other
two are new. Determining the likely members of these structures, we find that
as many as $75\%$ of stars can be associated with one of these features. Stars
belonging to the warped clockwise-disk show a top heavy K-band luminosity
function, while stars belonging to the larger separation features do not. Our
observations are in good agreement with the predictions of simulations of
in-situ star formation, and argue for common formation of these structures.

Title:Modeling the Optical to Ultraviolet Polarimetric Variability from Thomson Scattering in Colliding Wind Binaries,"
Abstract:  Massive star binaries are critical laboratories for measuring masses and
stellar wind mass-loss rates. A major challenge is inferring viewing
inclination and extracting information about the colliding wind interaction
(CWI) region. Polarimetric variability from electron scattering in the highly
ionized winds provides important diagnostic information about system geometry.
We combine for the first time the well-known generalized treatment of
\citet{brown_polarisation_1978} for variable polarization from binaries with
the semi-analytic solution for the geometry and surface density CWI shock
interface between the winds based on Canto et al 1996. Our calculations include
some simplifications in the form of inverse square-law wind densities and the
assumption of axisymmetry, but in so doing arrive at several robust
conclusions. One is that when the winds are nearly equal (e.g., O\,+\,O
binaries), the polarization has a relatively mild decline with binary
separation. Another is that despite Thomson scattering being a gray opacity,
the continuum polarization can show chromatic effects at ultraviolet
wavelengths but will be mostly constant at longer wavelengths. Finally, when
one wind dominates the other, as for example in WR+OB binaries, the
polarization is expected to be larger at wavelengths where the OB component is
more luminous, and generally smaller at wavelengths where the WR component is
more luminous. This behavior arises because from the perspective of the WR
star, the distortion of the scattering envelope from spherical is a minor
perturbation situated far from the WR star. By contrast, the polarization
contribution from the OB star is dominated by the geometry of the CWI shock.

Title:Designing an Optimal LSST Deep Drilling Program for Cosmology with Type Ia Supernovae,"
Abstract:  The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time is forecast
to collect a large sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) that could be
instrumental in unveiling the nature of Dark Energy. The feat, however,
requires measuring the two components of the Hubble diagram - distance modulus
and redshift - with a high degree of accuracy. Distance is estimated from SNe
Ia parameters extracted from light curve fits, where the average quality of
light curves is primarily driven by survey parameters such as the cadence and
the number of visits per band. An optimal observing strategy is thus critical
for measuring cosmological parameters with high accuracy. We present in this
paper a three-stage analysis aiming at quantifying the impact of the Deep
Drilling (DD) strategy parameters on three critical aspects of the survey: the
redshift completeness (originating from the Malmquist cosmological bias), the
number of well-measured SNe Ia, and the cosmological measurements. Analyzing
the current LSST survey simulations, we demonstrate that the current DD survey
plans are characterized by a low completeness ($z~\sim$ 0.55-0.65), and
irregular and low cadences (few days) that dramatically decrease the size of
the well-measured SNe Ia sample. We then propose a modus operandi that provides
the number of visits (per band) required to reach higher redshifts. The results
of this approach are used to design a set of optimized DD surveys for SNe Ia
cosmology. We show that most accurate cosmological measurements are achieved
with Deep Rolling surveys characterized by a high cadence (one day), a rolling
strategy (each field observed at least two seasons), and two sets of fields:
ultra-deep ($z \gtrsim 0.8$) and deep ($z \gtrsim 0.6$) fields. We also
demonstrate that a deterministic scheduler including a gap recovery mechanism
is critical to achieve a high quality DD survey required for SNe Ia cosmology.

Title:Photosphere Recession and Luminosity of Homologous Explosions Revisited,"
Abstract:  By assuming the photosphere located at the outmost edge of the ejecta, Arnett
et al. (1980, 1982, 1989) presented the light curves of homologous explosions
in supernovae analytically and numerically to include recombination effects.
Actually as homologous expansion proceeds, the photosphere recedes deeper into
the ejecta. In this situation, the photosphere radius increases at early times
and decreases later on which can be described by a simple method proposed by
Liu et al. (2018). To study how the photosphere recession effect the luminosity
evolution, we impose a boundary condition on the photosphere to determine the
spatial and time distribution of the temperature of the ejecta which is
clarified to be reasonable. We find that the photosphere recession reduce the
luminosity compared with the previous result without the recession, which can
be tested with observations of Type-IIP supernovae.

Title:Characterisation of the stellar content of SDSS EELGs through self-consistent spectral modelling,"
Abstract:  Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) are a notable galaxy genus, ultimately
being regarded as local prototypes of early galaxies at the cosmic noon. Robust
characterisation of their stellar content, however, is hindered by the
exceptionally high nebular emission present in their optical spectroscopic
data. This study is dedicated into recovering the stellar properties of a
sample of 414 EELGs as observed by the SDSS Survey. Such is achieved by means
of the spectral synthesis code FADO, which self-consistently considers the
stellar and nebular emission in an optical spectrum. Additionally, a
comparative analysis was carried on, by further processing the EELGs sample
with the purely stellar spectral synthesis code Starlight, and by extending the
analysis to a sample of 697 normal star-forming galaxies, expected to be less
affected by nebular contribution. We find that, for both galaxy samples,
stellar mass and mean age estimates by Starlight are systematically biased
towards higher values, and that an adequate determination of the physical and
evolutionary properties of EELGs via spectral synthesis is only possible when
nebular continuum emission is taken into account. Moreover, the differences
between the two population synthesis codes can be ascribed to the degree of
star-formation activity through the specific star-formation rate and the sum of
the flux of the most prominent emission lines. As expected, on the basis of the
theoretical framework, our results emphasise the importance of considering the
nebular emission while performing spectral synthesis, even for galaxies hosting
typical levels of star-formation activity.

Title:A hyper flare of a weeks-old magnetar born from a binary-neutron-star merger,"
Abstract:  Magnetars, a population of isolated neutron stars with ultra-strong magnetic
fields of $\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$ G, have been increasingly accepted to explain
a variety of astrophysical transients. A nascent millisecond-period magnetar
can release its spin-down energy and power bright sources such as Gamma-ray
Bursts (GRBs) and their subsequent X-ray plateaus, Super Luminous Supernovae
(SLSNe), and the fast X-ray transients such as CDF-S XT-2. Magnetars with ages
of $10^3-10^4$ years have been observed within the Milky Way Galaxy, which are
found to power diverse transients with the expense of their magnetic energy, in
the form of giant flares and repeated soft-$\gamma$-ray or hard X-ray bursts
and occasionally fast radio bursts (FRBs). Magnetar giant flares were also
detected as disguised short GRBs from nearby galaxies . Here we report the
identification of a GRB as a hyper flare of magnetar in a nearby galaxy. The
magnitude of the hyper flare is about one thousand times brighter than that of
a typical magnetar giant flare. A significant $\sim 80$ millisecond period is
detected in the decaying light curve. Interpreting this period as the rotation
period and given a magnetic field strength typical for a young magnetar, the
age of the magnetar is constrained to be only a few weeks. The non-detection of
a (superluminous) supernova nor a GRB weeks before the event further constrains
that the magnetar is likely born from an off-axis merger event of two neutron
stars. Our finding bridges the gap between the hypothetical millisecond
magnetars and the observed Galactic magnetars, and points toward a broader
channel of magnetar-powered gamma-ray transients.

Title:Further support and a candidate location for Planet 9,"
Abstract:  The existence of a hypothetical Planet 9 lurking in the outer solar system
has been invoked as a plausible explanation for the the anomalous clustering in
the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects. Here we propose to use meteors arriving
at Earth as messengers with the potential of revealing the presence of a
hitherto undiscovered massive object. The peculiar meteor CNEOS 2014-01-08,
recently put forward as the first interstellar meteor, might be one such
messenger. Its origin in the sky overlaps with the predicted band of possible
Planet 9 orbits and it is actually compatible with the highest probability
region. The odds of this coincidence being due to chance are of ~1%.
Furthermore, some statistical anomalies about CNEOS 2014-01-08 are resolved
under the hypothesis that it was flung at Earth by a gravitational encounter
with Planet 9. Based on the available data, we propose the region at
coordinates R.A.: 48.2 +/- 4, declination: 10.3 +/- 1.8, in the constellation
Aries, as the first candidate location for Planet 9.

Title:Dust coagulation during the early stages of star formation: molecular cloud collapse and first hydrostatic core evolution,"
Abstract:  Planet formation in protoplanetary discs requires dust grains to coagulate
from the sub-micron sizes that are found in the interstellar medium into much
larger objects. For the first time, we study the growth of dust grains during
the earliest phases of star formation using three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations. We begin with a typical interstellar dust grain size distribution
and study dust growth during the collapse of a molecular cloud core and the
evolution of the first hydrostatic core, prior to the formation of the stellar
core. We examine how the dust size distribution evolves both spatially and
temporarily. We find that the envelope maintains its initial population of
small dust grains with little growth during these phases, except that in the
inner few hundreds of au the smallest grains are depleted. However, once the
first hydrostatic core forms rapid dust growth to sizes in excess of $100~\mu$m
occurs within the core (before stellar core formation). Progressively larger
grains are produced at smaller distances from the centre of the core. In
rapidly-rotating molecular cloud cores, the `first hydrostatic core' that forms
is better described as a pre-stellar disc that may be gravitationally unstable.
In such cases, grain growth is more rapid in the spiral density waves leading
to the larger grains being preferentially found in the spiral waves even though
there is no migration of grains relative to the gas. Thus, the grain size
distribution can vary substantially in the first core/pre-stellar disc even at
these very early times.

Title:Top-down formation of ethylene from fragmentation of superhydrogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,"
Abstract:  Fragmentation is an important decay mechanism for polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) under harsh interstellar conditions and represents a
possible formation pathway for small molecules such as H2, C2H2, C2H4. Our aim
is to investigate the dissociation mechanism of superhydrogenated PAHs that
undergo energetic processing and the formation pathway of small hydrocarbons.
We obtain, experimentally, the mass distribution of protonated tetrahydropyrene
(C16H15 , py+5H+) and protonated hexahydropyrene (C16H17+, py+7H+) upon
collision induced dissociation (CID). The IR spectra of their main fragments
are recorded by infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD). Extended
tight-binding (GFN2-xTB) based molecular dynamics simulations are performed in
order to provide the missing structure information in experiment and identify
fragmentation pathways. The pathways for fragmentation are further investigated
at a hybrid-density functional theory (DFT) and dispersion corrected level. A
strong signal for loss of 28 mass units of py+7H+ is observed both in the CID
experiment and the MD simulation, while py+5H+ shows negligible signal for the
product corresponding to a mass loss of 28. The 28 mass loss from py+7H+ is
assigned to the loss of ethylene (C2H4) and a good fit between the calculated
and experimental IR spectrum of the resulting fragment species is obtained.
Further DFT calculations show favorable kinetic pathways for loss of C2H4 from
hydrogenated PAH configurations involving three consecutive CH2 molecular
entities. This joint experimental and theoretical investigation proposes a
chemical pathway of ethylene formation from fragmentation of superhydrogenated
PAHs. This pathway is sensitive to hydrogenated edges (e.g. the degree of
hydrogenation and the hydrogenated positions). The inclusion of this pathway in
astrochemical models may improve the estimated abundance of ethylene.

Title:Eruption and Interplanetary Evolution of a Stealthy Streamer-Blowout CME Observed by PSP at ${\sim}$0.5~AU,"
Abstract:  Streamer-blowout coronal mass ejections (SBO-CMEs) are the dominant CME
population during solar minimum. Although they are typically slow and lack
clear low-coronal signatures, they can cause geomagnetic storms. With the aid
of extrapolated coronal fields and remote observations of the off-limb low
corona, we study the initiation of an SBO-CME preceded by consecutive CME
eruptions consistent with a multi-stage sympathetic breakout scenario. From
inner-heliospheric Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations, it is evident that
the SBO-CME is interacting with the heliospheric magnetic field and plasma
sheet structures draped about the CME flux rope. We estimate that $18 \, \pm \,
11\%$ of the CME's azimuthal magnetic flux has been eroded through magnetic
reconnection and that this erosion began after a heliospheric distance of
${\sim}0.35$ AU from the Sun was reached. This observational study has
important implications for understanding the initiation of SBO-CMEs and their
interaction with the heliospheric surroundings.

Title:On the origin of core radio emissions from black hole sources in the realm of relativistic shocked accretion flow,"
Abstract:  We study the relativistic, inviscid, advective accretion flow around the
black holes and investigate a key feature of the accretion flow, namely the
shock waves. We observe that the shock-induced accretion solutions are
prevalent and such solutions are commonly obtained for a wide range of the flow
parameters, such as energy (${\cal E}$) and angular momentum ($\lambda$),
around the black holes of spin value $0\le a_{\rm k} < 1$. When the shock is
dissipative in nature, a part of the accretion energy is released through the
upper and lower surfaces of the disc at the location of the shock transition.
We find that the maximum accretion energies that can be extracted at the
dissipative shock ($\Delta{\cal E}^{\rm max}$) are $\sim 1\%$ and $\sim 4.4\%$
for Schwarzschild black holes ($a_{\rm k}\rightarrow 0$) and Kerr black holes
($a_{\rm k}\rightarrow 1$), respectively. Using $\Delta{\cal E}^{\rm max}$, we
compute the loss of kinetic power (equivalently shock luminosity, $L_{\rm
shock}$) that is enabled to comply with the energy budget for generating
jets/outflows from the jet base ($i.e.$, post-shock flow). We compare $L_{\rm
shock}$ with the observed core radio luminosity ($L_R$) of black hole sources
for a wide mass range spanning $10$ orders of magnitude with sub-Eddington
accretion rate and perceive that the present formalism seems to be potentially
viable to account $L_R$ of $16$ Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BH-XRBs)
and $2176$ active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We further aim to address the core
radio luminosity of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) sources and indicate
that the present model formalism perhaps adequate to explain core radio
emission of IMBH sources in the sub-Eddington accretion limit.

Abstract:  We address a phenomenon of a confined circumstellar (CS) dense shell and
powerful presupernova emission of SN 2020tlf (type IIP). Modeling the \ha\ line
and the circumstellar interaction implies the CS shell radius of
$\sim$10$^{15}$ cm and the mass of $\sim0.2M_{\odot}$ lost during $\sim$6 yr
prior to the explosion. Spectra and photometry of the supernova after the
explosion do not show apparent signature of the material lost by the
presupernova during its powerful luminosity. This material presumably resided
in the inner zone of the CS shell. We present a hydrodynamic model of the
outcome of a flash with the energy of $5\times10^{48}$ erg in the convective
nuclear burning zone. The model predicts the ejection of outer layers of the
presupernova ($\sim0.1M_{\odot}$) and the luminosity of $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$
during several hundreds days in accord with observations. We propose the
Lighthill mechanism of acoustic waves generation by the turbulence of the
convective nuclear burning zone to account for the phenomenon of a compact CS
shell of supernovae related to the core collapse.

Title:Towards Optimal Foreground Mitigation Strategies for Interferometric HI Intensity Mapping in the Low-Redshift Universe,"
Abstract:  We conduct the first case study towards developing optimal foreground
mitigation strategies for neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping using radio
interferometers at low redshifts. A pipeline for simulation, foreground
mitigation and power spectrum estimation is built, which can be used for
ongoing and future surveys using MeerKAT and SKAO. It simulates realistic sky
signals to generate visibility data given instrument and observation
specifications, which is subsequently used to perform foreground mitigation and
power spectrum estimation. A quadratic estimator formalism is developed to
estimate the temperature power spectrum in visibility space. Using MeerKAT
telescope specifications for observations in the redshift range z~0.25-0.30
corresponding to the MIGHTEE survey, we present a case study where we compare
different approaches of foreground mitigation. We find that component
separation in visibility space provides a more accurate estimation of HI
clustering comparing to foreground avoidance, with the uncertainties being 30%
smaller. Power spectrum estimation from image is found to be less robust with
larger bias and more information loss when compared to estimation in
visibility. We conclude that for z~0.25-0.30, the MIGHTEE survey will be
capable of measuring the HI power spectrum from k~0.5 Mpc$^{-1}$ to k~10
Mpc$^{-1}$ with high accuracy. We are the first to show that, at low redshift,
component separation in visibility space suppresses foreground contamination at
large line-of-sight scales, allowing measurement of HI power spectrum closer to
the foreground wedge, crucial for data analysis towards future detections.

emission light curve of GRB 210619B exhibits an extremely bright hard emission
pulse followed by softer/longer emission pulses. The low-energy photon indices
($\alpha_{\rm pt}$) values obtained using the time-resolved spectral analysis
of the burst reveal a transition between the thermal (during harder pulse) to
non-thermal (during softer pulse) outflow. We examine the correlation between
spectral parameters and find that both peak energy and $\alpha_{\rm pt}$
exhibit the flux tracking pattern. The late time broadband photometric dataset
can be explained within the framework of the external forward shock model with
$\nu_m$ $< \nu_c$ $< \nu_{x}$ (where $\nu_m$, $\nu_c$, and $\nu_{x}$ are the

Title:Transfer of Rocks between Planetary Systems: Panspermia Revisited,"
Abstract:  Motivated by the recent discovery of interstellar objects passing through the
solar system, and by recent developments in dynamical simulations, this paper
reconsiders the likelihood for life bearing rocks to be transferred from one
planetary system to another. The astronomical aspects of this lithopanspermia
process can now be estimated, including the cross sections for rock capture,
the velocity distributions of rocky ejecta, the survival times for captured
objects, and the dynamics of the solar system in both its birth cluster and in
the field. The remaining uncertainties are primarily biological, i.e., the
probability of life developing on a planet, the time required for such an
event, and the efficiency with which life becomes seeded in a new environment.
Using current estimates for the input quantities, we find that the transfer
rates are enhanced in the birth cluster, but the resulting odds for success are
too low for panspermia to be a likely occurrence. In contrast, the expected
inventory of alien rocks in the solar system is predicted to be substantial
(where the vast majority of such bodies are not biologically active and do not
interact with Earth).

Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC
progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial
conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high-resolution
(0.13$^{\prime\prime}$, $\sim$1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish
data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge `Cloud d' (G0.412$+$0.052,
mass$\sim 7.6 \times 10^4$ M$_{\odot}$, radius$\sim 3.2$ pc) has the potential
to become an Arches-like YMC (10$^4$ M$_{\odot}$, r$\sim$1 pc), but is not yet
forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star forming
massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the
initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum,
with masses $\lesssim$3 M$_{\odot}$ and radii of $\sim$10${}^3$ au. The source
masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent
fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical
state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates
is large. We find evidence for large-scale ($\sim$1 pc) converging gas flows,
which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10$^4$ M$_{\odot}$ within
10$^5$ yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the
large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find
no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions
for star formation, the resulting IMF will be bottom-heavy.

Title:Induced gravitational waves from statistically anisotropic scalar perturbations,"
Abstract:  Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are attracting growing attention
for probing extremely short-scale scalar perturbations via gravitational wave
measurements. In this paper, we investigate the SIGWs from statistically
anisotropic scalar perturbations, which are motivated in inflationary scenarios
in the presence of, e.g., a vector field. While the ensemble average of the
SIGW energy spectrum is isotropic for the standard statistically isotropic
scalar perturbations, the statistical anisotropy in the source introduces the
multipole moments of the differential SIGW energy spectrum. We consider
quadrupole anisotropy in the scalar power spectrum and show that the SIGW
spectrum has anisotropies up to $\ell=4$. We present generic formulas of the
multipole moments and then apply them to the delta-function-like and log-normal
source spectra. We find analytic expressions for the former case and show that
the infrared scalings of the multipole moments are the same as the isotropic
SIGWs. Interestingly, the monopole has an additional local minimum in the
high-$k$ tail, a key feature to distinguish from the isotropic SIGWs. The
latter log-normal case is analytic for the narrow-peak source, and we perform
the numerical calculation for the broad peak. As one expects, the multipole
moments become broader with increasing source width. Our results are helpful to
test the isotropy of primordial density perturbations at extremely small scales
through SIGWs.

Title:The angular scale of homogeneity with SDSS-IV DR16 Luminous Red Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We report measurements of the angular scale of cosmic homogeneity
($\theta_{H}$) using the recently released luminous red galaxy sample of the
sixteenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV LRG DR16). It
consists of a model-independent method, as we only use the celestial
coordinates of these objects to carry out such an analysis. The observational
data is divided into thin redshift bins, namely $0.67<z<0.68$, $0.70<z<0.71$,
and $0.73<z<0.74$, in order to avoid projection biases, and we estimate our
uncertainties through a bootstrap method and a suite of mock catalogues. We
find that the LRGs exhibit an angular scale of homogeneity consistent with the
predictions of the standard cosmology within the redshift interval studied.
Considering the bootstrap method, in which the measurements are obtained in a
model-independent way, we found at 1$\sigma$ level that $\theta_H^{boot}(0.675)
= 7.57 \pm 2.91$ deg, $\theta_H^{boot} (0.705) = 7.49 \pm 2.63$ deg and
$\theta_H^{boot} (0.735) = 8.88 \pm 2.81$ deg. Such results are in good
agreement with the ones obtained using mock catalogues built under the
assumption of the standard cosmological model.

Title:Stellar dynamics and dark matter in Local Group dwarf galaxies,"
Abstract:  When interpreted within the standard framework of Newtonian gravity and
dynamics, the kinematics of stars and gas in dwarf galaxies reveals that most
of these systems are completely dominated by their dark matter halos. These
dwarf galaxies are thus among the best astrophysical laboratories to study the
structure of dark halos and the nature of dark matter. We review the properties
of the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group from the point of view of stellar
dynamics. After describing the observed kinematics of their stellar components
and providing an overview of the dynamical modelling techniques, we look into
the dark matter content and distribution of these galaxies, as inferred from
the combination of observed data and dynamical models. We also briefly touch
upon the prospects of using nearby dwarf galaxies as targets for indirect
detection of dark matter via annihilation or decay emission.

Title:The Visual Survey Group: A Decade of Hunting Exoplanets and Unusual Stellar Events with Space-Based Telescopes,"
Abstract:  This article presents the history of the Visual Survey Group (VSG) - a
Professional-Amateur (Pro-Am) collaboration within the field of astronomy
working on data from several space missions (Kepler, K2 and TESS). This paper
covers the formation of the VSG, its survey-methods including the most common
tools used and its discoveries made over the past decade. So far, the group has
visually surveyed nearly 10 million light curves and authored 69 peer-reviewed
papers which mainly focus on exoplanets and discoveries involving multistellar
systems found using the transit method. The preferred manual search-method
carried out by the VSG has revealed its strength by detecting numerous
sub-stellar objects which were overlooked or discarded by automated search
programs, uncovering some of the most rare stars in our galaxy, and leading to
several serendipitous discoveries of unprecedented astrophysical phenomena. The
main purpose of the VSG is to assist in the exploration of our local Universe,
and we therefore advocate continued crowd-sourced examination of time-domain
data sets, and invite other research teams to reach out in order to establish
collaborating projects.

Title:Patchy nightside clouds on ultra-hot Jupiters: General Circulation Model simulations with radiatively active cloud tracers,"
Abstract:  The atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters have been characterized in detail
through recent phase curve and low- and high-resolution emission and
transmission spectroscopic observations. Previous numerical studies have
analyzed the effect of the localized recombination of hydrogen on the
atmospheric dynamics and heat transport of ultra-hot Jupiters, finding that
hydrogen dissociation and recombination lead to a reduction in the day-to-night
contrasts of ultra-hot Jupiters relative to previous expectations. In this
work, we add to previous efforts by also considering the localized condensation
of clouds in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters, their resulting transport
by the atmospheric circulation, and the radiative feedback of clouds on the
atmospheric dynamics. To do so, we include radiatively active cloud tracers
into the existing MITgcm framework for simulating the atmospheric dynamics of
ultra-hot Jupiters. We take cloud condensate properties appropriate for the
high-temperature condensate corundum from CARMA cloud microphysics models. We
conduct a suite of GCM simulations with varying cloud microphysical and
radiative properties, and we find that partial cloud coverage is a ubiquitous
outcome of our simulations. This patchy cloud distribution is inherently set by
atmospheric dynamics in addition to equilibrium cloud condensation, and causes
a cloud greenhouse effect that warms the atmosphere below the cloud deck.
Nightside clouds are further sequestered at depth due to a dynamically induced
high-altitude thermal inversion. We post-process our GCMs with the Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code gCMCRT and find that the patchy clouds on ultra-hot
Jupiters do not significantly impact transmission spectra but can affect their
phase-dependent emission spectra.

Title:Non-Universal Stellar Initial Mass Functions: Large Uncertainties in Star Formation Rates at $z\approx 2-4$ and Other Astrophysical Probes,"
Abstract:  We explore the assumption, widely used in many astrophysical calculations,
that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is universal across all galaxies.
By considering both a canonical Salpeter-like IMF and a non-universal IMF, we
are able to compare the effect of different IMFs on multiple observables and
derived quantities in astrophysics. Specifically, we consider a non-universal
IMF which varies as a function of the local star formation rate, and explore
the effects on the star formation rate density (SFRD), the extragalactic
background light, the supernova (both core-collapse and thermonuclear) rates,
and the diffuse supernova neutrino background. Our most interesting result is
that our adopted varying IMF leads to much greater uncertainty on the SFRD at
$z \approx 2-4$ than is usually assumed. Indeed, we find a SFRD (inferred using
observed galaxy luminosity distributions) that is a factor of $\gtrsim 3$ lower
than canonical results obtained using a universal Salpeter-like IMF. Secondly,
the non-universal IMF we explore implies a reduction in the supernova
core-collapse rate of a factor of $\sim2$, compared against a universal IMF.
The other potential tracers are only slightly affected by changes to the
properties of the IMF. We find that currently available data do not provide a
clear preference for universal or non-universal IMF. However, improvements to
measurements of the star formation rate and core-collapse supernova rate at
redshifts $z \gtrsim 2$ may offer the best prospects for discernment.

"Title:Cosmological Bound on the QCD Axion Mass, Redux","
Abstract:  We revisit the joint constraints in the mixed hot dark matter scenario in
which both thermally produced QCD axions and relic neutrinos are present. Upon
recomputing the cosmological axion abundance via recent advances in the
literature, we improve the state-of-the-art analyses and provide updated bounds
on axion and neutrino masses. By avoiding approximate methods, such as the
instantaneous decoupling approximation, and limitations due to the limited
validity of the perturbative approach in QCD that forced to artificially divide
the constraints from the axion-pion and the axion-gluon production channels, we
find robust and self-consistent limits. We investigate the two most popular
axion frameworks: KSVZ and DFSZ. From Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) light
element abundances data we find for the KSVZ axion $\Delta N_{\rm eff}<0.31$
and an axion mass bound $m_a < 0.53 $ eV (i.e., a bound on the axion decay
constant $f_a > 1.07 \times 10^7$ GeV) both at $95\%$ CL. These BBN bounds are
improved to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}<0.14$ and $m_a< 0.16$ eV ($f_a > 3.56 \times
10^7$ GeV) if a prior on the baryon energy density from Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) data is assumed. When instead considering cosmological
observations from the CMB temperature, polarization and lensing from the Planck
satellite combined with large scale structure data we find $\Delta N_{\rm
eff}<0.23$, $m_a< 0.28$ eV ($f_a > 2.02 \times 10^7$ GeV) and $\sum m_\nu <
0.16$ eV at $95\%$ CL. This corresponds approximately to a factor of $5$
improvement in the axion mass bound with respect to the existing limits. Very
similar results are obtained for the DFSZ axion. We also forecast upcoming
observations from future CMB and galaxy surveys, showing that they could reach
percent level errors for $m_a\sim 1$ eV.

Title:Impact of Point Spread Function Higher Moments Error on Weak Gravitational Lensing II: A Comprehensive Study,"
Abstract:  Weak gravitational lensing, or weak lensing, is one of the most powerful
probes for dark matter and dark energy science, although it faces increasing
challenges in controlling systematic uncertainties as \edit{the statistical
errors become smaller}. The Point Spread Function (PSF) needs to be precisely
modeled to avoid systematic error on the weak lensing measurements. The weak
lensing biases induced by errors in the PSF model second moments, i.e., its
size and shape, are well-studied. However, Zhang et al. (2021) showed that
errors in the higher moments of the PSF may also be a significant source of
systematics for upcoming weak lensing surveys. Therefore, the goal of this work
is to comprehensively investigate the modeling quality of PSF moments from the
$3^{\text{rd}}$ to $6^{\text{th}}$ order, and estimate their impact on
cosmological parameter inference. We propagate the \textsc{PSFEx} higher
moments modeling error in the HSC survey dataset to the weak lensing
\edit{shear-shear correlation functions} and their cosmological analyses. We
find that the overall multiplicative shear bias associated with errors in PSF
higher moments can cause a $\sim 0.1 \sigma$ shift on the cosmological
parameters for LSST Y10. PSF higher moment errors also cause additive biases in
the weak lensing shear, which, if not accounted for in the cosmological
parameter analysis, can induce cosmological parameter biases comparable to
their $1\sigma$ uncertainties for LSST Y10. We compare the \textsc{PSFEx} model
with PSF in Full FOV (\textsc{Piff}), and find similar performance in modeling
the PSF higher moments. We conclude that PSF higher moment errors of the future
PSF models should be reduced from those in current methods to avoid a need to
explicitly model these effects in the weak lensing analysis.

Title:The Diverse Properties of Type Icn Supernovae Point to Multiple Progenitor Channels,"
Abstract:  We present a sample of Type Icn supernovae (SNe Icn), a newly-discovered
class of transients characterized by their interaction with H- and He-poor
circumstellar material (CSM). This sample is the largest collection of SNe Icn
to date and includes observations of two published objects (SN 2019hgp and SN
2021csp) as well as two objects (SN 2019jc and SN 2021ckj) not yet published in
the literature. The SNe Icn display a range of peak luminosities, rise times,
and decline rates, as well as diverse late-time spectral features. To
investigate their explosion and progenitor properties we fit their bolometric
light curves to a semi-analytical model consisting of luminosity inputs from
circumstellar interaction and radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni. We infer low
ejecta masses ($\lesssim$ 2 M$_\odot$) and $^{56}$Ni masses ($\lesssim$ 0.04
M$_\odot$) from the light curves, suggesting that normal stripped-envelope
supernova (SESN) explosions within a dense CSM cannot be the underlying
mechanism powering SNe Icn. Additionally, we find that an upper limit on the
star formation rate density at the location of SN 2019jc lies at the lower end
of a distribution of SESNe, in conflict with a massive star progenitor of this
object. Based on the estimated ejecta masses, $^{56}$Ni masses, and explosion
site properties, we favor a low-mass, ultra-stripped star as the progenitor of
some SNe Icn. For others, we suggest that a Wolf-Rayet star progenitor may
better explain their observed properties. This study demonstrates that multiple
progenitor channels may produce SNe Icn and other interaction-powered
transients.

Title:The Great Planetary Heist: Theft and capture in star-forming regions,"
Abstract:  Gravitational interactions in star-forming regions are capable of disrupting
and destroying planetary systems, as well as creating new ones. In particular,
a planet can be stolen, where it is directly exchanged between passing stars
during an interaction; or captured, where a planet is first ejected from its
birth system and is free-floating for a period of time, before being captured
by a passing star. We perform sets of direct N-body simulations of young,
substructured star-forming regions, and follow their evolution for 10 Myr in
order to determine how many planets are stolen and captured, and their
respective orbital properties. We show that in high density star-forming
regions, stolen and captured planets have distinct properties. The semimajor
axis distribution of captured planets is significantly skewed to wider orbits
compared to the semimajor axis distribution of stolen planets and planets that
are still orbiting their parent star (preserved planets). However, the
eccentricity and inclination distributions of captured and stolen planets are
similar, but in turn very different to the inclination and eccentricity
distributions of preserved planets. In low-density star-forming regions these
differences are not as distinct but could still, in principle, be used to
determine whether observed exoplanets have likely formed in situ or have been
stolen or captured. We find that the initial degree of spatial and kinematic
substructure in a star-forming region is as important a factor as the stellar
density in determining whether a planetary system will be altered, disrupted,
captured or stolen.

Title:Fast and realistic large-scale structure from machine-learning-augmented random field simulations,"
Abstract:  Producing thousands of simulations of the dark matter distribution in the
Universe with increasing precision is a challenging but critical task to
facilitate the exploitation of current and forthcoming cosmological surveys.
Many inexpensive substitutes to full $N$-body simulations have been proposed,
even though they often fail to reproduce the statistics of the smaller,
non-linear scales. Among these alternatives, a common approximation is
represented by the lognormal distribution, which comes with its own limitations
as well, while being extremely fast to compute even for high-resolution density
fields. In this work, we train a machine learning model to transform projected
lognormal dark matter density fields to more realistic dark matter maps, as
obtained from full $N$-body simulations. We detail the procedure that we follow
to generate highly correlated pairs of lognormal and simulated maps, which we
use as our training data, exploiting the information of the Fourier phases. We
demonstrate the performance of our model comparing various statistical tests
with different field resolutions, redshifts and cosmological parameters,
proving its robustness and explaining its current limitations. The augmented
lognormal random fields reproduce the power spectrum up to wavenumbers of $1 \
h \ \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$, the bispectrum and the peak counts within 10%, and always
within the error bars, of the fiducial target simulations. Finally, we describe
how we plan to integrate our proposed model with existing tools to yield more
accurate spherical random fields for weak lensing analysis, going beyond the
lognormal approximation.

Title:A comprehensive X-ray view of the active nucleus in NGC 4258,"
Abstract:  (Abridged) We present a detailed broadband X-ray spectrum of NGC 4258, with
the goal of precisely measuring the coronal luminosity and accretion flow
properties of the AGN, and track any possible variation across two decades of
observations. We collect archival XMM-Newton, Chandra, Swift/BAT and NuSTAR
spectroscopic observations spanning 15 years, and fit them with a suite of
state of the art models, including a warped disk model which is suspected to
provide the well known obscuration observed in the X-rays. We complement this
information with archival results from the literature. Clear spectral
variability is observed among the different epochs. The obscuring column
density shows possibly periodic fluctuations on a timescale of 10 years, while
the intrinsic luminosity displays a long term decrease of a factor of three in
a time span of 15 years (from $L_{2-10~\text{keV}} \sim 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$
in the early 2000s, to $L_{2-10~\text{keV}} \sim 3 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$
in 2016). The average absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity
$L_{2-10~\text{keV}}$, combined with archival determinations of the bolometric
luminosity, implies a bolometric correction $k_{\rm bol} \sim 20$, intriguingly
typical for Seyferts powered by accretion through geometrically thin,
radiatively efficient disks. Moreover, the X-ray photon index $\Gamma$ is
consistent with the typical value of the broader AGN population. However, the
accretion rate in Eddington units is very low, well within the expected RIAF
regime. Our results suggest that NGC 4258 is a genuinely low-luminosity Seyfert
II, with no strong indications in its X-ray emission for a hot, RIAF-like
accretion flow.

Abstract:  We report on the short and long term X-ray properties of the bright nearby
Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 2992, which was extensively observed with Swift,
XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Swift targeted the source more than 100 times between
2019 and 2021 in the context of two monitoring campaigns. Both time-averaged
and time-resolved analyses are performed, and we find that the short-to-long
term spectral properties of NGC 2992 are dominated by a highly variable nuclear
continuum. The source varied in the 2-10 keV energy band from 0.6 to 12
$\times$ 10$^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ during the two year long Swift
monitoring. The fastest 2-10 keV flux change (by a factor of $\sim60\%$)
occurred on a timescale of a few hours. The overall emission spectrum of the
source is consistent with a power law-like continuum ($\Gamma=1.69\pm0.01$)
absorbed by a constant line-of-sight column density N$_{H}=(7.8\pm0.1)\times$
10$^{21}$ $\rm cm^{-2}$. The reflected emission is likely due to matter with an
average column density N$_{\rm H}=(9.6\pm2.7)\times$ 10$^{22}$ $\rm cm^{-2}$,
thus NGC 2992 appears to have a globally Compton-thin circumnuclear medium.
This scenario is fully supported by an independent analysis of the fractional
variability and by XMM-Newton multi-year spectra.

Title:A simulated annealing approach to parameter inference with expensive likelihoods,"
Abstract:  We present a new approach to parameter inference targeted on generic
situations where the evaluation of the likelihood $\mathcal{L}$ (i.e., the
probability to observe the data given a fixed model configuration) is
numerically expensive. Inspired by ideas underlying simulated annealing, the
method first evaluates $\chi^2=-2\ln\mathcal{L}$ on a sparse sequence of Latin
hypercubes of increasing density in parameter (eigen)space. The semi-stochastic
choice of sampling points accounts for anisotropic gradients of $\chi^2$ and
rapidly zooms in on the minimum of $\chi^2$. The sampled $\chi^2$ values are
then used to train an interpolator which is further used in a standard Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to inexpensively explore the parameter space
with high density, similarly to emulator-based approaches now popular in
cosmological studies. Comparisons with example linear and non-linear problems
show gains in the number of likelihood evaluations of factors of 10 to 100 or
more, as compared to standard MCMC algorithms. As a specific implementation, we
publicly release the code PICASA: Parameter Inference using Cobaya with
Anisotropic Simulated Annealing, which combines the minimizer (of a
user-defined $\chi^2$) with Gaussian Process Regression for training the
interpolator and a subsequent MCMC implementation using the COBAYA framework.
Being agnostic to the nature of the observable data and the theoretical model,
our implementation is potentially useful for a number of emerging problems in
cosmology, astrophysics and beyond.

Title:Starbursts with suppressed velocity dispersion revealed in a forming cluster at z=2.51,"
Abstract:  One of the most prominent features of galaxy clusters is the presence of a
dominant population of massive ellipticals in their cores. Stellar archaeology
suggests that these gigantic beasts assembled most of their stars in the early
Universe via starbursts. However, the role of dense environments and their
detailed physical mechanisms in triggering starburst activities remain unknown.
Here we report spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) observations of the CO $J= 3-2$ emission line, with a resolution of
about 2.5 kiloparsecs, toward a forming galaxy cluster core with starburst
galaxies at $z=2.51$. In contrast to starburst galaxies in the field often
associated with galaxy mergers or highly turbulent gaseous disks, our
observations show that the two starbursts in the cluster exhibit dynamically
cold (rotation-dominated) gas-rich disks. Their gas disks have extremely low
velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\mathrm{0}} \sim 20-30$ km s$^{-1}$), which is
three times lower than their field counterparts at similar redshifts. The high
gas fraction and suppressed velocity dispersion yield gravitationally unstable
gas disks, which enables highly efficient star formation. The suppressed
velocity dispersion, likely induced by the accretion of corotating and coplanar
cold gas, might serve as an essential avenue to trigger starbursts in massive
halos at high redshifts.

Title:Ghostly Stellar Haloes and their Relationship to Ultra-faint Dwarfs,"
Abstract:  Ghostly stellar haloes are extended haloes of stars composed solely of debris
of pre-reionization fossil galaxies and should exist in dwarf galaxies with
total masses $<10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. Fossil galaxies are even smaller mass dwarf
galaxies that stopped forming stars after the epoch of reionization and have
been identified in the Local Group as the ultra-faint dwarf satellites. Using
cosmological N-body simulations we present an empirical model for the shapes
and masses of ghostly stellar haloes. We compare the model to available
observations of stellar haloes in six isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local
Group (Leo T, Leo A, IC 10, WLM, IC 1613, NGC 6822) to infer the star formation
efficiency in dwarf galaxies at the epoch of reionization. We find an
efficiency of star formation in dark matter haloes with masses $10^6 - 10^8$
M$_\odot$ at $z\sim7$ in rough agreement with independent methods using data on
the luminosity function of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies but systematically higher
by a factor of 3-5. The systematic uncertainty of our results is still large,
mainly because available observations of stellar halo profiles do not extend
over a sufficiently large distance from the center of the host dwarf galaxy.
Additional observations, easily within reach of current telescopes, can
significantly improve the accuracy of this method and can also be used to
constrain the present day dark matter masses of dwarf galaxies in the Local
Group. Our method is based on a set of observations never used before, hence it
is a new independent test of models of hierarchical galaxy formation.

Title:Simulating cold shear flows on a moving mesh,"
Abstract:  Rotationally supported, cold, gaseous disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics
and appear in a diverse set of systems, such as protoplanetary disks, accretion
disks around black holes, or large spiral galaxies. Capturing the gas dynamics
accurately in these systems is challenging in numerical simulations due to the
low sound speed compared to the bulk velocity of the gas, the resolution
limitations of full disk models, and the fact that numerical noise can easily
source spurious growth of fluid instabilities if not suppressed sufficiently
well, negatively interfering with real physical instabilities present in such
disks (like the magneto-rotational instability). Here we implement the
so-called shearing-box approximation in the moving-mesh code ${\small AREPO}$
in order to facilitate achieving high resolution in local regions of
differentially rotating disks and to address these problems. While our new
approach offers manifest translational invariance across the shearing-box
boundaries and offers continuous local adaptivity, we demonstrate that the
unstructured mesh of ${\small AREPO}$ introduces unwanted levels of
""grid-noise"" in the default version of the code. We show that this can be
rectified by high-order integrations of the flux over mesh boundaries. With our
new techniques we obtain highly accurate results for shearing-box calculations
of the magneto-rotational instability that are superior to other Lagrangian
techniques. These improvements are also of value for other applications of the
code that feature strong shear flows.

Title:A Highly Variable Magnetized Environment in a Pulsar Binary resembling Fast Radio Bursts,"
Abstract:  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short, intense extragalactic radio bursts of
unknown origin. Recent polarimetric studies have shown that a noticeable
fraction of the repeating FRBs display irregular, short-time variations of the
Faraday rotation measure (RM). Moreover, evidence for rare propagation effects
such as Faraday conversion and polarized attenuation is seen in at least one
FRB repeater. Together, they suggest a highly variable magneto-active
circum-burst environment. In this paper, we report similar behavior in a
globular cluster pulsar binary system PSR B1744-24A. We observe irregular fast
changes of RM with both signs at random orbital phases as well as profile
changes of the circular polarization when the pulsar emission passes close to
the companion. The latter provides strong evidence for Faraday conversion and
circularly polarized attenuation. These similarities between PSR B1744-24A and
some FRB repeaters, as well as the possible binary-produced long-term
periodicity of two active repeaters, and the discovery of a nearby FRB in a
globular cluster, where pulsar binaries are common, all suggest that some
fraction of FRBs have binary companions.

out-of-equilibrium suite of gasses than a writhing octopus. Yet, anything short
of a writhing octopus will raise skepticism among astrobiologists about what
has been detected. Resolving that skepticism requires a theory to delineate
processes due to life and those due solely to abiotic mechanisms. This poses an
existential question for the endeavor of life detection: How do astrobiologists
plan to detect life via features shared between non-living and living systems?
We argue that you cannot without an underlying theory of life. We illustrate
this by analyzing the hypothetical detection of an ""Earth 2.0"" exoplanet. In
the absence of a theory of life, we argue the community should focus on
identifying unambiguous features of life via four areas of active research:
understanding the principles of life on Earth, building life in the lab,
detecting life in the solar system and searching for technosignatures.
Ultimately, we ask, what exactly do astrobiologists hope to learn by searching
for life?

Title:Dark lenses through the dust: parallax microlensing events in the VVV,"
Abstract:  We use near-infrared photometry and astrometry from the VISTA Variables in
the Via Lactea (VVV) survey to analyse microlensing events containing annual
microlensing parallax information. These events are located in highly extincted
and low-latitude regions of the Galactic bulge typically off-limits to optical
microlensing surveys. We fit a catalog of $1959$ events previously found in the
VVV and extract $21$ microlensing parallax candidates. The fitting is done
using nested sampling to automatically characterise the multi-modal and
degenerate posterior distributions of the annual microlensing parallax signal.
We compute the probability density in lens mass-distance using the source
proper motion and a Galactic model of disc and bulge deflectors. By comparing
the expected flux from a main sequence lens to the baseline magnitude and
blending parameter, we identify 4 candidates which have probability $> 50$%
that the lens is dark. The strongest candidate corresponds to a nearby
($\approx0.78$ kpc), medium-mass ($1.46^{+1.13}_{-0.71} \ M_{\odot}$) dark
remnant as lens. In the next strongest, the lens is located at heliocentric
distance $\approx5.3$ kpc. It is a dark remnant with a mass of
$1.63^{+1.15}_{-0.70} \ M_{\odot}$. Both of those candidates are most likely
neutron stars, though possibly high-mass white dwarfs. The last two events may
also be caused by dark remnants, though we are unable to rule out other
possibilities because of limitations in the data.

Title:Model-independent constraints on the baryon fraction in the IGM from fast radio bursts and supernovae data,"
Abstract:  Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients with an
observed dispersion measure ($DM$) greater than the expected Milky Way
contribution, which suggests that such events are of extragalactic origin.
Although some models have been proposed to explain the physics of the pulse,
the mechanism behind the FRBs emission still unknown. From FRBs data with known
host galaxies, the redshift is directly measured and can be combined with
estimates of the $DM$ to constrain the cosmological parameters, such as the
baryon number density and the Hubble constant. However, the poor knowledge of
the fraction of baryonic mass in the intergalactic medium ($f_{IGM}$) and its
degeneracy with the cosmological parameters impose limits on the cosmological
application of FRBs. In this work we present a model-independent method to
determine the evolution of $f_{IGM}$, combining the latest FRBs observations
with localized host galaxy and current supernovae data. In our analysis we
consider constant and time-dependent $f_{IGM}$ parameterizations and show,
through a Bayesian model selection analysis, that there is a strong evidence in
favor of a growing evolution of $f_{IGM}$ with redshift.

Title:Oscillating Magnetized Color Superconducting Quark Stars,"
Abstract:  The main objective of this work is to study the structure, composition, and
oscillation modes of color superconducting quark stars with intense magnetic
fields. We adopted the MIT bag model within the color superconductivity CFL
framework, and we included the effects of strong magnetic fields to construct
the equation of state of stable quark matter. We calculated observable
quantities, such as the mass, radius, frequency, and damping time of the
oscillation fundamental $f$ mode of quark stars, taking into account current
astrophysical constraints. The results obtained show that color superconducting
magnetized quark stars satisfy the constraints imposed by the observations of
massive pulsars and gravitational wave events. Furthermore, the quantities
associated with the oscillation $f$ mode of these objects fit the universal
relationships for compact objects. In the context of the new multi-messenger
gravitational wave astronomy era and the future asteroseismology of neutron
stars, we hope that our results contribute to the understanding of the behavior
of dense matter and compact objects.

"Title:Dusty, Self-Obscured Transients from Stellar Mergers and Common Envelope Phases","
Abstract:  We discuss the central role that dust condensation plays in shaping the
observational appearance of outflows from coalescing binary systems. As
binaries enter into a common envelope phase or merger, they shock-heat and
expel material into their surroundings. Depending on the properties of the
merging system, this material can expand to the point where molecules and dust
form, dramatically increasing the gas opacity. We use the existing population
of Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) to constrain the thermodynamics of these ejecta,
then apply our findings to the progressive obscuration of merging systems in
the lead in to their coalescence. Compact progenitor stars near the main
sequence or in the Hertzsprung gap along with massive progenitor stars have
sufficiently hot circumstellar material to remain unobscured by dust. By
contrast, more extended, low-mass giants should become completely optically
obscured by dust formation in the circumbinary environment. We predict that
approximately half of stellar merger and common envelope transients for
solar-mass stars will be dusty, infrared-luminous sources. The dusty, infrared
transients will selectively trace the population of systems that may
successfully eject their common envelopes, while the unobscured, optical
transients correspond to the LRNe population of stellar mergers.

Title:Exomoons as sources of white dwarf pollution,"
Abstract:  Polluted white dwarfs offer a unique way to study the bulk compositions of
exoplanetary material, but it is not always clear if this material originates
from comets, asteroids, moons, or planets. We combine N-body simulations with
an analytical model to assess the prevalence of extrasolar moons as white dwarf
(WD) polluters. Using a sample of observed polluted white dwarfs we find that
the extrapolated parent body masses of the polluters are often more consistent
with those of many solar system moons, rather than solar-like asteroids. We
provide a framework for estimating the fraction of white dwarfs currently
undergoing observable moon accretion based on results from simulated white
dwarf planetary and moon systems. Focusing on a three-planet white dwarf system
of Super-Earth to Neptune-mass bodies, we find that we could expect about one
percent of such systems to be currently undergoing moon accretions as opposed
to asteroid accretion.

Title:Pseudostreamer influence on flux rope evolution,"
Abstract:  A critical aspect of solar activity is the coupling between eruptions and the
surrounding coronal magnetic field, which determines the trajectory and
morphology of the eruptive event. Pseudostreamers (PSs) are coronal magnetic
structures formed by arcs of twin loops capped by magnetic field lines from
coronal holes of the same polarity that meet at a central spine. They contain a
single magnetic null point in the spine, potentially influencing the evolution
of nearby flux ropes (FRs). To understand the net effect of the PS on FR
eruptions is first necessary to study diverse and isolated FR-PS scenarios,
which are not influenced by other magnetic structures. We performed numerical
simulations in which a FR structure is in the vicinity of a PS magnetic
configuration. The combined magnetic field of the PS and the FR results in the
formation of two magnetic null points. We evolve this scenario by numerically
solving the magnetohydrodynamic equations in 2.5D. The simulations consider a
fully ionised compressible ideal plasma in the presence of a gravitational
field and a stratified atmosphere. We find that the dynamic behaviour of the FR
can be categorised into three different classes based on the FR trajectories
and whether it is eruptive or confined. Our analysis indicates that the
magnetic null points are decisive in the direction and intensity of the FR
deflection and their hierarchy depends on the topological arrangement of the
scenario. Moreover, the PS lobe acts as a magnetic cage enclosing the FR. We
report that the total unsigned magnetic flux of the cage is a key parameter
defining whether the FR is ejected or not.

Title:The Optical Depth of Foregrounds for the Highest Redshift 21 cm Signals,"
Abstract:  Foreground emission makes it difficult to detect the highly-redshifted
cosmological 21 cm signal at any frequency. However, at low frequencies
foregrounds are likely to become optically thick, which would make it
completely impossible to see a 21 cm signal behind them. To find out which
regions of the sky might be optically thick for the highest redshifts of the 21
cm signal, we fit the measurements from LWA1 and the Haslam 408 MHz map with a
two-component spectral model and calculate the frequency-dependent foreground
optical depth point-by-point across the sky. Limitations of the current data
prevent us from making any strong conclusions at high statistical significance,
but there is suggestive evidence ($\sim1\sigma$) that as much as 25% of the sky
could be obscured for the highest redshift 21 cm signals.

Title:The Proper Motion of the Pulsar J1124-5916 in the Galactic Supernova Remnant G292.0+1.8,"
Abstract:  We present the first direct measurement of the proper motion of pulsar
J1124-5916 in the young, oxygen-rich supernova remnant G292.0+1.8. Using deep
Chandra ACIS-I observations from 2006 and 2016, we measure a positional change
of $0.^{\prime\prime}21$ $\pm$ $0.^{\prime\prime}05$ over the $\sim$ 10 year
baseline, or $\sim$ $0.^{\prime\prime}02$ yr$^{-1}$. At a distance of 6.2 $\pm$
0.9 kpc, this corresponds to a kick velocity in the plane of the sky of
$\mathrm{612\pm 152\,km \, s^{-1}}$. We compare this direct measurement against
the velocity inferred from estimates based on the center of mass of the ejecta.
Additionally, we use this new proper motion measurement to compare the motion
of the neutron star to the center of expansion of the optically emitting
ejecta. We derive an age estimate for the supernova remnant of $\gtrsim$ 2000
years. The high measured kick velocity is in line with recent studies of high
proper motion neutron stars in other Galactic supernova remnants, and
consistent with a hydrodynamic origin to the neutron star kick.

Title:The Ages of Galactic Bulge Stars with Realistic Uncertainties,"
Abstract:  Using modern isochrones with customized physics and carefully considered
statistical techniques, we recompute the age distribution for a sample of 91
micro-lensed dwarfs in the Galactic bulge presented by Bensby et al. (2017) and
do not produce an age distribution consistent with their results. In
particular, our analysis finds that only 15 of 91 stars have ages younger than
7 Gyr, compared to their finding of 42 young stars in the same sample. While we
do not find a constituency of very young stars, our results do suggest the
presence of an $\sim8$ Gyr population at the highest metallicities, thus
contributing to long-standing debate about the age--metallicity distribution of
the Galactic bulge. We supplement this with attempts at independent age
determinations from two sources of photometry, BDBS and \textit{Gaia}, but find
that the imprecision of photometric measurements prevents reliable age and age
uncertainty determinations. Lastly, we present age uncertainties derived using
a first-order consideration of global modeling uncertainties in addition to
standard observational uncertainties. The theoretical uncertainties are based
on the known variance of free parameters in the 1D stellar evolution models
used to generate isochrones, and when included, result in age uncertainties of
$2$--$5$ Gyr for this spectroscopically well-constrained sample. These error
bars, which are roughly twice as large as typical literature values, constitute
realistic lower limits on the true age uncertainties.

Title:X-rays in Cepheids: Identifying Low-Mass Companions of Intermediate-Mass Stars,"
Abstract:  X-ray observations have been made of a sample of 20 classical Cepheids,
including two new observations (Polaris and {\it l} Car) reported here. The
occurrence of X-ray flux around the pulsation cycle is discussed. Three
Cepheids are detected ($\delta$ Cep, $\beta$ Dor, and Polaris). X-rays have
also been detected from the low--mass F, G, and K companions of 4 Cepheids
(V473 Lyr, R Cru, V659 Cen, and W Sgr), and one hot companion (S Mus). Upper
limits on the X-ray flux of the remaining Cepheids provide an estimate that
28\% have low mass companions. This fraction of low--mass companions in
intermediate mass Cepheids is significantly lower than expected from random
pairing with the field IMF. Combining the companion fraction from X-rays with
that from ultraviolet observations results in a binary/multiple fraction of
57\% $\pm$12\% for Cepheids with the ratios q $>$ 0.1 and separations a $>$ 1
au. This is a lower limit since M stars are not included. X-ray observations
detect less massive companions than other existing studies of intermediate mass
stars. Our measured occurrence rate of unresolved, low-mass companions to
Cepheids suggests that intermediate-period binaries derive from a combination
of disk and core fragmentation and accretion. This yields a hybrid mass-ratio
distribution that is skewed toward small values compared to a uniform
distribution but is still top-heavy compared to random pairings drawn from the
IMF.

Title:Can the Distance-Redshift Relation Be Determined from Correlations Between Luminosities?,"
Abstract:  We explore whether an independent determination of the distance-redshift
relation, and hence cosmological model parameters, can be obtained from the
apparent correlations between two different waveband luminosities or fluxes, as
has been claimed in recent works using the X-ray and ultraviolet luminosities
and fluxes of quasars. We show that such an independent determination is
possible only if the correlation between luminosities is obtained independent
of the cosmological model, and measured fluxes and redshifts; for example,
being based on sound theoretical models or unrelated observations. In
particular, we show that if the correlation is determined empirically from two
luminosities obtained from fluxes and redshifts, then the method suffers from
circularity. In case, as claimed in recent works, the observed correlation
between fluxes in very narrow redshift bins are used as proxy for the
luminosity correlation, then we show that one is dealing with a pure tautology
with no information on distances and cosmological model. We argue that the
problem arises because of the incomplete treatment of the correlation and we
use numerical methods with a joint X-ray and ultraviolet quasar data set to
demonstrate this shortcoming.

Title:The Cosmic Large-Scale Structure in X-rays (CLASSIX) cluster survey IV: Superclusters in the local Universe at z <= 0.03,"
Abstract:  It is important to map the large-scale matter distribution in the local
Universe for cosmological studies, such as the tracing of the large-scale
peculiar velocity flow, the characterisation of the environment for different
astronomical objects, and for precision measurements of cosmological
parameters. We used X-ray luminous clusters to map this matter distribution and
find that about 51% of the groups and clusters are members of superclusters
which occupy only a few percent of the volume. In this paper we provide a
detailed description of these large-scale structures. With a friends-to-friends
algorithm, we find eight superclusters with a cluster overdensity ratio of at
least two with five or more galaxy group and cluster members in the cosmic
volume out to z = 0.03. The four most prominent ones are the Perseus-Pisces,
the Centaurus, the Coma, and the Hercules supercluster, with lengths from about
40 to over 100 Mpc and estimated masses of 0.6 - 2.2 10^16 Msun. The largest of
these structures is the Perseus-Pisces supercluster. The four smaller
superclusters include the Local and the Abell 400 supercluster and two
superclusters in the constellations Sagittarius and Lacerta. We provide
detailed maps, member catalogues, and physical descriptions of the eight
superclusters. By constructing superclusters with a range of cluster
sub-samples with different lower X-ray luminosity limits, we show that the main
structures are always reliably recovered.

Title:Optimal method for reconstructing polychromatic maps from broadband observations with an aysmmetric antenna pattern,"
Abstract:  Broadband time-ordered data obtained from telescopes with a
wavelength-dependent, asymmetric beam pattern can be used to extract maps at
multiple wavelengths from a single scan. This technique is especially useful
when collecting data on cosmic phenomena such as the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) radiation, as it provides the ability to separate the CMB
signal from foreground contaminants. We develop a method to determine the
optimal linear combinations of wavelengths (""colors"") that can be reconstructed
for a given telescope design and the number of colors that are measurable with
high signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal colors are found as eigenvectors of a
matrix derived from the inverse noise covariance matrix. When the telescope is
able to scan the sky isotropically, it is useful to transform to a spherical
harmonic basis, in which this matrix has a particularly simple form. We propose
using the optimal colors determined from the isotropic case even when the
actual scanning pattern is not isotropic (e.g., covers only part of the sky).
We perform simulations showing that maps in multiple colors can be
reconstructed accurately from both full-sky and partial-sky scans. Although the
original motivation for this research comes from mapping the CMB, this method
of polychromatic map-making will have broader applications throughout
astrophysics.

Title:Revisit the periodicity of SGR J1935+2154 bursts with updated sample,"
Abstract:  Since FRB 200428 has been found to be associated with an X-ray burst from the
Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154, it is interesting to explore whether the
magnetar bursts also follow the similar active periodic behavior as some
repeating FRBs. Previous studies show that there is possible period about 230
day in SGR J1935+2154 bursts. Here, we collected an updated burst sample from
SGR J1935+2154, including all bursts reported by Fermi/GBM and GECAM till 2022
January. We also developed a targeted search pipeline to reveal more bursts
from SGR J1935+2154 in the Fermi/GBM data from 2008 August to 2014 December
(i.e. before the first burst detected by Swift/BAT). With this burst sample, we
re-analyzed the possible periodicity of SGR J1935+2154 bursts using the Period
Folding and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram methods. Our results show that the
periodicity $\sim$238 day reported in literature is probably fake and the
observation effects may introduce false periods (i.e. 55 day) according to
simulation tests. We find that, for the current burst sample, the most probable
period is 126.88$\pm$2.05 day, which could be interpreted as the precession of
the magnetar. However, we note that the whole burst history is very complicated
and difficult to be perfectly accommodated with any period reported thus far,
therefore more monitoring observations of SGR J1935+2154 are required to test
any periodicity hypothesis.

Title:GaiaHub: A method for combining data from the Gaia and Hubble space telescopes to derive improved proper motions for faint stars,"
Abstract:  We present GaiaHub, a publicly available tool that combines $Gaia$
measurements with $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ ($HST$) archival images to
derive proper motions (PMs). It increases the scientific impact of both
observatories beyond their individual capabilities. $Gaia$ provides PMs across
the whole sky, but the limited mirror size and time baseline restrict the best
PM performance to relatively bright stars. $HST$ can measure accurate PMs for
much fainter stars over a small field, but this requires two epochs of
observation which are not always available. GaiaHub yields considerably
improved PM accuracy compared to $Gaia$-only measurements, especially for faint
sources $(G \gtrsim 18)$, requiring only a single epoch of $HST$ data observed
more than $\sim 7$ years ago (before 2012). This provides considerable
scientific value especially for dynamical studies of stellar systems or
structures in and beyond the Milky Way (MW) halo, for which the member stars
are generally faint. To illustrate the capabilities and demonstrate the
accuracy of GaiaHub, we apply it to samples of MW globular clusters (GCs) and
classical dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellite galaxies. This allows us, e.g., to
measure the velocity dispersions in the plane of the sky for objects out to and
beyond $\sim 100$ kpc. We find, on average, mild radial velocity anisotropy in
GCs, consistent with existing results for more nearby samples. We observe a
correlation between the internal kinematics of the clusters and their
ellipticity, with more isotropic clusters being, on average, more round. Our
results also support previous findings that Draco and Sculptor dSph galaxies
appear to be radially anisotropic systems.

Title:Limit on the dark matter mass from its interaction with photons,"
Abstract:  In this work, we explore the phenomenology of generalized dark matter (GDM)
which interacts with photons ($\gamma$). We assume that DM establishes elastic
scattering with $\gamma$ when it has already become nonrelativistic, otherwise
the abundance of DM today is disfavored by current observations. Within this
scenario, the equation of state (EoS) of DM is determined by its mass
($m_\chi$) and the DM-$\gamma$ scattering cross-section. The distinctive
imprints of a nonzero EoS of DM on CMB angular power spectrum allow us to set a
lower limit on $m_\chi$ with Planck 2018 data alone, i.e., $m_{\chi} > 8.7$ keV
at $95\%$ C.L. In the study of cosmic concordance problems, we find that the
GDM scenario preserves the sound horizon ($r_s(z_*)$) predicted in the fiducial
$\Lambda$CDM model, and thus does not solve the $H_0$ tension. When performing
the joint analysis of Planck+LSS datasets, the best-fit $S_8= 0.785\pm 0.017$
closely matches the given $S_8$ prior. This suggests that the GDM scenario can
be counted as a viable candidate to restore the $S_8$ ($\sigma_{8}$) tension.

absolute astrometry monitoring data on the VLT. Relative astrometry with NACO
fully constrains the Keplerian orbit of the binary pair, while absolute
astrometry with FORS2 measures the system's parallax and mass ratio. We find a
parallax consistent with the Hipparcos and Gaia values for $\varepsilon$ Indi
A, and a mass ratio for $\varepsilon$ Indi Ba to Bb precise to better than
$0.2\%$. $\varepsilon$ Indi Ba and Bb have spectral types T1-1.5 and T6,
respectively. With an age of $3.5^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$ Gyr from $\varepsilon$ Indi
A's activity, these brown dwarfs provide some of the most precise benchmarks
for substellar cooling models. Assuming coevality, the very different
luminosities of the two brown dwarfs and our moderate mass ratio imply a steep
mass-luminosity relationship $L \propto M^{5.37 \pm 0.08}$ that can be
explained by a slowed cooling rate in the L/T transition, as previously
observed for other L/T binaries. Finally, we present a periodogram analysis of
the near-infrared photometric data, but find no definitive evidence of periodic
signals with a coherent phase.

Title:Event reconstruction of Compton telescopes using a multi-task neural network,"
Abstract:  We have developed a neural network model to perform event reconstruction of
Compton telescopes. This model reconstructs events that consist of three or
more interactions in a detector. It is essential for Compton telescopes to
determine the time order of the gamma-ray interactions and whether the incident
photon deposits all energy in a detector or it escapes from the detector. Our
model simultaneously predicts these two essential factors using a multi-task
neural network with three hidden layers of fully connected nodes. For
verification, we have conducted numerical experiments using Monte Carlo
simulation, assuming a large-area Compton telescope using liquid argon to
measure gamma rays with energies up to $3.0\,\mathrm{MeV}$. The reconstruction
model shows excellent performance of event reconstruction for multiple
scattering events that consist of up to eight hits. The accuracies of hit order
prediction are around $60\%$ while those of escape flags are higher than $70\%$
for up to eight-hit events of $4\pi$ isotropic photons. Compared with two other
algorithms, a classical model and a physics-based probabilistic one, the
present neural network method shows high performance in estimation accuracy
particularly when the number of scattering is small, 3 or 4. Since simulation
data easily optimize the network model, the model can be flexibly applied to a
wide variety of Compton telescopes.

Title:Dense Gas Formation via Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection in a Disk Galaxy with a BiSymmetric Spiral Magnetic Field,"
Abstract:  Recently, a collision-induced magnetic reconnection (CMR) mechanism was
proposed to explain a dense filament formation in the Orion A giant molecular
cloud. A natural question is that whether CMR works elsewhere in the Galaxy. As
an initial attempt to answer the question, this paper investigates the
triggering of CMR and the production of dense gas in a flat-rotating disk with
a modified BiSymmetric Spiral (BSS) magnetic field. Cloud-cloud collisions at
field reversals in the disk are modeled with the Athena++ code. Under the
condition that is representative of the warm neutral medium, the cloud-cloud
collision successfully triggers CMR at different disk radii. However, dense gas
formation is hindered by the dominating thermal pressure, unless a moderately
stronger initial field $\gtrsim5\mu$G is present. The strong-field model,
having a larger Lundquist number $S_L$ and lower plasma $\beta$, activates the
plasmoid instability in the collision midplane, which is otherwise suppressed
by the disk rotation. We speculate that CMR can be common if more clouds
collide along field reversals. However, to witness the CMR process in numerical
simulations, we need to significantly resolve the collision midplane with a
spatial dynamic range $\gtrsim10^6$. If Milky Way spiral arms indeed coincide
with field reversals in BSS, it is possible that CMR creates or maintains dense
gas in the arms. High-resolution, high-sensitivity Zeeman/Faraday-Rotation
observations are crucial for finding CMR candidates that have helical fields.

Title:Comparison of spatial distributions of Intracluster light and Dark Matter,"
Abstract:  In a galaxy cluster, the relative spatial distributions of dark matter,
member galaxies, gas, and intracluster light (ICL) may connote their mutual
interactions over the cluster evolution. However, it is a challenging problem
to provide a quantitative measure for the shape matching between two
multi-dimensional scalar distributions. We present a novel methodology, named
the {\em Weighted Overlap Coefficient (WOC)}, to quantify the similarity of
2-dimensional spatial distributions. We compare the WOC with a standard method
known as the Modified Hausdorff Distance (MHD). We find that our method is
robust, and performs well even with the existence of multiple sub-structures.
We apply our methodology to search for a visible component whose spatial
distribution resembled with that of dark matter. If such a component could be
found to trace the dark matter distribution with high fidelity for more relaxed
galaxy clusters, then the similarity of the distributions could also be used as
a dynamical stage estimator of the cluster. We apply the method to six galaxy
clusters at different dynamical stages simulated within the GRT simulation,

various components (stellar particles, galaxies, ICL), the ICL+ brightest

"Title:The specific heat of astro-materials: Review of theoretical concepts, materials and techniques","
Abstract:  We provide detailed background, theoretical and practical, on the specific
heat cp of minerals and mixtures thereof, 'astro-materials', as well as
background information on common minerals and other relevant solid substances
found on the surfaces of solar system bodies. Furthermore, we demonstrate how
to use specific heat and composition data for lunar samples and meteorites as
well as a new database of endmember mineral heat capacities (the result of an
extensive literature review) to construct reference models for the isobaric
specific heat cP as a function of temperature for common solar system
materials. Using a (generally linear) mixing model for the specific heat of
minerals allows extrapolation of the available data to very low and very high
temperatures, such that models cover the temperature range between 10 and 1000
K at least (and pressures from zero up to several kbars). We describe a
procedure to estimate cp(T) for virtually any solid solar system material with
a known mineral composition, e.g., model specific heat as a function of
temperature for a number of typical meteorite classes with known mineralogical
compositions. We present, as examples, the cp(T) curves of a number of
well-described laboratory regolith analogues, as well as for planetary ices and
'tholins' in the outer solar system. Part II will review and present the heat
capacity database for minerals and compounds and part III is going to cover
applications, standard reference compositions, cp(T) curves and a comparison
with new and literature experimental data.

Title:Light curve analysis of six totally eclipsing W UMa binaries,"
Abstract:  We analyze multicolor light curves of six totally eclipsing, short-period W
UMa binaries and derive, for the first time, their orbital and stellar
parameters. The mass ratios are established robustly through an automated
q-search procedure that performs a heuristic survey of the parameter space.
Five stars belong to the W and one to the A subtype. The mass ratios range from
0.23 to 0.51 and the fillouts from 10 to 15%. We estimate the ages and discuss
the evolutionary status of these objects in comparison with a sample of other
short-period W UMa binaries from the literature.

Title:A NuSTAR and Swift View of the Hard State of MAXI J1813-095,"
Abstract:  We present an analysis of the NuSTAR and Swift spectra of the black hole
candidate MAXI J1813-095 in a failed-transition outburst in 2018. The NuSTAR
observations show evidence of reflected emission from the inner region of the
accretion disc. By modelling the reflection component in the spectra, we find a
disc inner radius of $R_{\rm in}<7$ $r_{\rm g}$. This result suggests that
either a slightly truncated disc or a non-truncated disc forms at a few percent
of the Eddington limit in MAXI J1813-095. Our best-fit reflection models
indicate that the geometry of the innermost accretion remains consistent during
the period of NuSTAR observations. The spectral variability of MAXI J1813-095
from multi-epoch observations is dominated by the variable photon index of the
Comptonisation emission.

Title:A Disc Reflection Model for Ultra-Soft Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We present a detailed analysis of the XMM-Newton observations of five
narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). They all show very soft continuum
emission in the X-ray band with a photon index of $\Gamma\gtrsim 2.5$.
Therefore, they are referred to as `ultra-soft' NLS1s in this paper. By
modeling their optical/UV-X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) with a
reflection-based model, we find indications that the disc surface in these
ultra-soft NLS1s is in a higher ionisation state than other typical Seyfert 1
AGN. Our best-fit SED models suggest that these five ultra-soft NLS1s have an
Eddington ratio of $\lambda_{\rm Edd}=1-20$ assuming available black hole mass
measurements. In addition, our models infer that a significant fraction of the
disc energy in these ultra-soft NLS1s is radiated away in the form of
non-thermal emission instead of the thermal emission from the disc. Due to
their extreme properties, X-ray observations of these sources in the iron band
are particularly challenging. Future observations, e.g. from Athena, will
enable us to have a clearer view of the spectral shape in the iron band and
thus distinguish the reflection model from other interpretations of their
broadband spectra.

Title:How well do local relations predict gas-phase metallicity gradients? Results from SDSS-IV MaNGA,"
Abstract:  Gas-phase metallicity gradients in galaxies provide important clues to those
galaxies' formation histories. Using SDSS-IV MaNGA data, we previously
demonstrated that gas metallicity gradients vary systematically and
significantly across the galaxy mass--size plane: at stellar masses beyond
approximately $10^{10}$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$, more extended galaxies display
steeper gradients (in units of $\mathrm{dex/R_e}$) at a given stellar mass.
Here, we set out to develop a physical interpretation of these findings by
examining the ability of local $\sim$kpc-scale relations to predict the
gradient behaviour along the mass--size plane. We find that local stellar mass
surface density, when combined with total stellar mass, is sufficient to
reproduce the overall mass--size trend in a qualitative sense. We further find
that we can improve the predictions by correcting for residual trends relating
to the recent star formation histories of star-forming regions. However, we
find as well that the most extended galaxies display steeper average gradients
than predicted, even after correcting for residual metallicity trends with
other local parameters. From these results, we argue that gas-phase metallicity
gradients can largely be understood in terms of known local relations, but we
also discuss some possible physical causes of discrepant gradients.

Title:Triggered Population III star formation: the effect of H$_2$ self-shielding,"
Abstract:  The multiplicity of metal-free (Population III) stars may influence their
feedback efficiency within their host dark matter halos, affecting subsequent
metal enrichment and the transition to galaxy formation. Radiative feedback
from massive stars can trigger nearby star formation in dense self-shielded
clouds. In model radiation self-shielding, the H$_2$ column density must be
accurately computed. In this study, we compare two local approximations based
on the density gradient and Jeans length with a direct integration of column
density along rays. After the primary massive star forms, we find that no
secondary stars form for both the direct integration and density gradient
approaches. The approximate method reduces the computation time by a factor of
2. The Jeans length approximation overestimates the H$_2$ column density by a
factor of 10, leading to five numerically enhanced self-shielded, star-forming
clumps. We conclude that the density gradient approximation is sufficiently
accurate for larger volume galaxy simulations, although one must still caution
that the approximation cannot fully reproduce the result of direct integration.

Title:Revisiting The Mass-Size Relation Of Structures In Molecular Clouds,"
Abstract:  We revisit the mass-size relation of molecular cloud structures based on the
column density map of the Cygnus-X molecular cloud complex. We extract 135
column density peaks in Cygnus-X and analyze the column density distributions
around these peaks. The averaged column density profiles, $N(R)$, around all
the peaks can be well fitted with broken power-laws, which are described by an
inner power-law index $n$, outer power-law index $m$, and the radius $R_{\rm
TP}$ and column density $N_{\rm TP}$ at the transition point. We then explore
the $M-R$ relation with different samples of cloud structures by varying the
$N(R)$ parameters and the column density threshold, $N_0$, which determines the
boundary of a cloud structure. We find that only when $N_0$ has a wide range of
values, the $M - R$ relation may largely probe the density distribution, and
the fitted power-law index of the $M-R$ relation is related to the power-law
index of $N(R)$. On the contrary, with a constant $N_0$, the $M - R$ relation
has no direct connection with the density distribution; in this case, the
fitted power-law index of the $M - R$ relation is equal to 2 (when $N_0\ge
N_{\rm TP}$ and $n$ has a narrow range of values), larger than 2 (when $N_0\ge
N_{\rm TP}$ and $n$ has a wide range of values), or slightly less than 2 (when
$N_0< N_{\rm TP}$).

Title:New pulse profile variability associated with the glitch of PSR J0738-4042,"
Abstract:  The close correlation observed between emission state and spin-down rate
change of pulsars has many implications both for the magnetospheric physics and
the neutron star interior. The middle-aged pulsar PSR J0738--4042, which had
been observed to display variations in the pulse profile associated with its
spin-down rate change due to external effects, is a remarkable member of this
class. In this study, based on the 12.5-yr combined public timing data from
UTMOST and Parkes, we have detected a new emission-rotation correlation in PSR
J0738--4042 concurrent with a glitch. The first glitch occurred in this pulsar
at MJD 57359(5) (December 3, 2015) is considered to be underlying reason of the
variability. Unlike the usual glitch behaviours, the braking torque on the
pulsar has continued to increase over 1380 d since small spin-up event
($\Delta\nu/\nu \sim 0.36(4)\times 10^{-9}$), corresponding to a significant
decrease in $\ddot{\nu}$. As for changes in the pulse profile after the glitch,
the relative amplitude of the leading component weakens drastically, while the
middle component becomes stronger. A combined model of crustquake induced
platelet movement and vortex creep response is invoked to account for this rare
correlation. In this scenario, magnetospheric state-change is naturally linked
to the pulsar-intrinsic processes that give rise to a glitch.

Title:How do Spitzer IRAC Fluxes Compare to HST CALSPEC,"
Abstract:  An accurate tabulation of stellar brightness in physical units is essential
for a multitude of scientific endeavors. The HST/CALSPEC database of flux
standards contains many stars with spectral coverage in the 0.115--1 \micron\
range with some extensions to longer wavelengths of 1.7 or 2.5 \micron. Modeled
flux distributions to 32 \micron\ for calibration of JWST complement the
shorter wavelength HST measurements. Understanding the differences between IRAC
observations and CALSPEC models is important for science that uses IR fluxes
from multiple instruments, including JWST. The absolute flux of Spitzer IRAC
photometry at 3.6--8 \micron\ agrees with CALSPEC synthetic photometry to 1\%
for the three prime HST standards G191B2B, GD153, and GD71. For a set of 17--22
A-star standards, the average IRAC difference rises from agreement at 3.6
\micron\ to 3.4 $\pm$0.1\% brighter than CALSPEC at 8 \micron. For a smaller
set of G-stars, the average of the IRAC photometry falls below CALSPEC by as
much as 3.7 $\pm$0.3\% for IRAC1, while one G-star, P330E, is consistent with
the A-star ensemble of IRAC/CALSPEC ratios.

Title:The Role of Inner HI Mass in Regulating the Scatter of the Mass-Metallicity Relation,"
Abstract:  We use 789 disk-like, star-forming galaxies (with 596 HI detections) from HI
follow-up observations for the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey to study the possible role
of inner HI gas in causing secondary dependences in the mass-gas-phase
metallicity relation. We use the gas-phase metallicity derived at the effective
radii of the galaxies. We derive the inner HI mass witHIn the optical radius,
but also use the total HI mass and star formation rate (SFR) for a comparison.
We confirm the anticorrelation between the total HI mass and gas-phase
metallicity at fixed stellar mass, but the anticorrelation is significantly
strengthened when the total HI mass is replaced by the inner HI mass.
Introducing a secondary relation with the inner HI mass can produce a small but
noticeable decrease (16%) in the scatter of the mass-gas-phase metallicity
relation, in contrast to the negligible effect with the SFR. The correlation
with the inner HI mass is robust when using different diagnostics of
metallicity, but the correlation with SFR is not. The correlation with the
inner HI mass becomes much weaker when the gas-phase metallicity is derived in
the central region instead of at the effective radius. These results support
the idea that the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation is regulated by gas
accretion, and not directly by the SFR, and stress the importance of deriving
the gas mass and the metallicity from roughly the same region. The new relation
between inner HI mass and gas-phase metallicity will provide new constraints
for chemical and galaxy evolution models.

Title:Dust Production in a Thin Dense Shell in Supernovae with Early Circumstellar Interactions,"
Abstract:  In supernovae (SNe), where the light curves show evidence of strong and early
interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar matter (CSM), the
formation of new dust is estimated to take place in a dense shell of gas
between the forward (FS) and the reverse shock (RS). For the first time, in
this study, the mechanism of dust formation in this dense shell is modeled. A
set of 9 cases, considering variations of the ejecta mass, and the
pre-explosion mass-loss rates is considered, accounting for the diverse nature
of interactions reported in such SNe. For a single main sequence mass, the
variation of ejecta mass was manifested as a variation of the H-shell mass of
the star, lost due to pre-explosion mass-loss. We find that the dust masses in
the dense shell range between 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and 0.8 M$_{\odot}$,
composed of O-rich and C-rich grains, whose relative proportions are determined
by the nature of interaction. Dust formation in the post-shock gas is
characterized by a gradual production rate, mostly ranging from 10$^{-6}$ to
10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ day$^{-1}$, which may continue for a decade,
post-explosion. A higher mass-loss rate leads to a larger mass of dust, while a
smaller ejecta mass (smaller left-over H-shell) increases the efficiency of
dust production in such SNe. Dust formed behind the RS, as in our calculations,
is not subject to destruction by either the FS or RS and is thus likely to
survive in larger proportion than dust formed in the ejecta.

Abstract:  For decades, perhaps even centuries, the exchange of publications between

results, either in the form of observational data or new scientific theories.
In particular, small observatories or institutions used this method. The
exchange of physical material between observatories has now been replaced by

has never been digitized and can only be found in the few existing collections
of observatory publications. A recent donation of such a collection from the
University of Copenhagen to our own library at the University of Southern
Denmark has led us to investigate the uniqueness of such collections: Which
observatories and publications are represented in the collections that still
exist today? We also examine the availability of the material in the

"Title:An orbital perspective on the starvation, stripping, and quenching of satellite galaxies in the EAGLE simulations","
Abstract:  Using the EAGLE suite of simulations, we demonstrate that both cold gas
stripping {\it and} starvation of gas inflow play an important role in
quenching satellite galaxies across a range of stellar and halo masses,
$M_{\star}$ and $M_{200}$. By quantifying the balance between gas inflows,
outflows, and star formation rates, we show that even at $z=2$, only
$\approx30\%$ of satellite galaxies are able to maintain equilibrium or grow
their reservoir of cool gas - compared to $\approx50\%$ of central galaxies at
this redshift. We find that the number of orbits completed by a satellite is a
very good predictor of its quenching, even more so than the time since infall.
On average, we show that intermediate-mass satellites with $M_{\star}$ between
$10^{9}{\rm M}_{\odot}-10^{10}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ will be quenched at first
pericenter in massive group environments, $M_{200}>10^{13.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$;
and will be quenched at second pericenter in less massive group environments,
$M_{200}<10^{13.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. On average, more massive satellites
($M_{\star}>10^{10}{\rm M}_{\odot}$) experience longer depletion time-scales,
being quenched between first and second pericenters in massive groups; while in
smaller group environments, just $\approx30\%$ will be quenched even after two
orbits. Our results suggest that while starvation alone may be enough to slowly
quench satellite galaxies, direct gas stripping, particularly at pericenters,
is required to produce the short quenching time-scales exhibited in the
simulation.

Title:Galaxy cluster aperture masses are more robust to baryonic effects than 3D halo masses,"
Abstract:  Systematic uncertainties in the mass measurement of galaxy clusters limit the
cosmological constraining power of future surveys that will detect more than
$10^5$ clusters. Previously, we argued that aperture masses can be inferred
more accurately and precisely than 3D masses without loss of cosmological
constraining power. Here, we use the Baryons and Haloes of Massive Systems
(BAHAMAS) cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to show that aperture masses
are also less sensitive to changes in mass caused by galaxy formation
processes. For haloes with $m_\mathrm{200m,dmo} > 10^{14} \, h^{-1} \,
\mathrm{M}_\odot$, binned by their 3D halo mass, baryonic physics affects
aperture masses and 3D halo masses similarly when measured within apertures
similar to the halo virial radius, reaching a maximum reduction of $\approx 3
\, \%$. For lower-mass haloes, $10^{13.5} < m_\mathrm{200m,dmo} / (h^{-1} \,
\mathrm{M}_\odot) < 10^{14}$, and aperture sizes $\sim 1 \, h^{-1} \,
\mathrm{cMpc}$, representative of weak lensing observations, the aperture mass
is consistently reduced less ($\lesssim 5 \, \%$) than the 3D halo mass
($\lesssim 10 \, \%$ for $m_\mathrm{200m}$). The halo mass reduction evolves
only slightly, by up to $2$ percentage points, between redshift 0.25 and 1 for
both the aperture mass and $m_\mathrm{200m}$. Varying the strength of the
simulated feedback so the mean simulated hot gas fraction covers the observed
scatter inferred from X-ray observations, we find that the aperture mass is
consistently less biased than the 3D halo mass, by up to $2 \, $ percentage
points at $m_\mathrm{200m,dmo} = 10^{14} \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$.
Therefore, cluster aperture mass calibrations provide a fruitful path forward
for future cluster surveys to reduce their sensitivity to systematic
uncertainties.

Title:GRB 220426A: a thermal radiation dominated gamma-ray burst,"
Abstract:  The physical composition of the ejecta of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an
open question. The radiation mechanism of the prompt gamma-rays is also in
debate. This problem can be solved for the bursts hosting distinct thermal
radiation. However, the events with dominant thermal spectral components are
still rare. In this work, we focus on GRB 220426A, a recent event detected by
Fermi-GBM. The time-resolved and time-integrated data analyses yield very hard
low-energy spectrum but rather soft high-energy spectrum. This means that the
spectra of GRB 220426A are narrowly distributed, similar to GRB 090902B. And
the Bayesian inference results are in favor of the multicolor blackbody (mBB)
model. The physical properties of the relativistic outflow are calculated.
Assuming a redshift $z= 1.4$, the bulk Lorentz factors $\Gamma$ of the shells
are found to be between $274.15_{-18.22}^{+24.19}$ and
$827.03_{-71.48}^{+100.72}$, and the corresponding photosphere radii $R_{\rm

time-resolved properties of GRB 220426A satisfy the observed $\Gamma-L$ and
$E_p-L$ correlations, where $L$ is the luminosity of the prompt emission and
$E_{\rm p}$ is the spectral peak energy.

Title:Curved jet motion. I. Orbiting and precessing jets,"
Abstract:  Astrophysical jets are often observed as bent or curved structures. We also
know that the different jet sources may be binary in nature, which may lead to
a regular, periodic motion of the jet nozzle, an orbital motion or precession.
Here, we present the results of 2D (M)HD simulations in order to investigate
how a precessing or orbiting jet nozzle affects the propagation of a high-speed
jet. We have performed a parameter study of systems with different precession
angles, orbital periods or separations, and different magnetic field strengths.
We find that these kinds of nozzles lead to curved jet propagation which is
determined by the main parameters that define the jet nozzle. We find C-shaped
jets from orbiting nozzles and S-shaped jets from precessing nozzles. Over long
time and long distances, the initially curved jet motion bores a broad channel
into the ambient gas that is filled with high-speed jet material which lateral
motion is damped, however. A strong (longitudinal) magnetic field can damp the
jet curvature that is enforced by either precession of orbital motion of the
jet sources. We have investigated the force balance across the jet and ambient
medium and found that the lateral magnetic pressure and gas pressure gradients
are almost balanced, but that a lack of gas pressure on the concave side of the
curvature is leading to the lateral motion. Magnetic tension does not play a
significant role. Our results are obtained in code units, but we provide
scaling relations such that our results may be applied to young stars,
micro-quasars, symbiotic stars or AGN.

corresponding kilonova AT2017gfo and the short gamma-ray burst GRB170817A, as
well as the observed afterglow has delivered a scientific breakthrough. For an
accurate interpretation of all these different messengers, one requires robust
theoretical models that describe the emitted gravitational-wave, the
electromagnetic emission, and dense matter reliably. In addition, one needs
efficient and accurate computational tools to ensure a correct
cross-correlation between the models and the observational data. For this
purpose, we have developed the NMMA (Nuclear-physics and Multi-Messenger
Astrophysics) framework. The code allows incorporation of nuclear-physics
constraints at low densities as well as X-ray and radio observations of
isolated neutron stars. It also enables us to classify electromagnetic
observations, e.g., to distinguish between supernovae and kilonovae. In
previous works, the NMMA code has allowed us to constrain the equation of state
of supranuclear dense matter, to measure the Hubble constant, and to compare
dense-matter physics probed in neutron-star mergers and in heavy-ion
collisions. The extension of the NMMA code presented here is the first attempt
of analysing the gravitational-wave signal, the kilonovae, and the GRB
afterglow simultaneously, which reduces the uncertainty of our constraints.
Incorporating all available information, we estimate the radius of a 1.4 solar
mass neutron star to be $R=11.98^{+0.35}_{-0.40}$ km.

Abstract:  Radiative transfer modelling offers a powerful tool for understanding the
enigmatic hydrogen emission lines from T Tauri stars. This work compares
optical and near-IR spectroscopy of 29 T Tauri stars with our grid of synthetic
line profiles. The archival spectra, obtained with VLT's X-Shooter, provide
simultaneous coverage of many optical and infrared hydrogen lines. The
observations exhibit similar morphologies of line profiles seen in other
studies. We used the radiative transfer code TORUS to create synthetic
H$\alpha$, Pa$\beta$, Pa$\gamma$, and Br$\gamma$ emission lines for a fiducial
T Tauri model that included axisymmetric magnetospheric accretion and a polar
stellar wind. The distribution of Reipurth types and line widths for the
synthetic H$\alpha$ lines is similar to the observed results. However, the
modelled infrared lines are narrower than the observations by $\approx 80{~\rm
kms}^{-1}$, and our models predict a significantly higher proportion ($\approx
90$ per cent) of inverse P-Cygni profiles. Furthermore, our radiative transfer
models suggest that the frequency of P-Cygni profiles depends on the ratio of
the mass loss to mass accretion rates and blue-shifted sub-continuum absorption
was predicted for mass loss rates as low as $10^{-12}~M_{\odot}{\rm~ yr}^{-1}$.
We explore the effect of rotation, turbulence, and the contributions from
red-shifted absorption in an attempt to explain the discrepancy in widths. Our
findings show that, singularly, none of these effects is sufficient to explain
the observed disparity. However, a combination of rotation, turbulence, and
non-axisymmetric accretion may improve the fit of the models to the observed
data.

Title:Anisotropic diffusion cannot explain TeV halo observations,"
Abstract:  TeV halos are regions of enhanced photon emissivity surrounding pulsars.
While multiple sources have been discovered, a self-consistent explanation of
their radial profile and spherically-symmetric morphology remains elusive due
to the difficulty in confining high-energy electrons and positrons within ~20
pc regions of the interstellar medium. One proposed solution utilizes
anisotropic diffusion to confine the electron population within a ""tube"" that
is auspiciously oriented along the line of sight. In this work, we show that
while such models may explain a unique source such as Geminga, the phase space
of such solutions is very small and they are unable to simultaneously explain
the size and approximate radial symmetry of the TeV halo population.

Title:Avoiding a Cluster Catastrophe: Retention Efficiency and the Binary Black Hole Mass Spectrum,"
Abstract:  The population of binary black hole mergers identified through gravitational
waves has uncovered unexpected features in the intrinsic properties of black
holes in the universe. One particularly surprising and exciting result is the
possible existence of black holes in the pair-instability mass gap,
$\sim50-120~M_\odot$. Dense stellar environments can populate this region of
mass space through hierarchical mergers, with the retention efficiency of black
hole merger products strongly dependent on the escape velocity of the host
environment. We use simple toy models to represent hierarchical merger
scenarios in various dynamical environments. We find that hierarchical mergers
in environments with high escape velocities $(\gtrsim300~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1})$
are efficiently retained. If such environments dominate the binary black hole
merger rate, this would lead to an abundance of high-mass mergers that is
potentially incompatible with the empirical mass spectrum from the current
catalog of binary black hole mergers. Models that efficiently generate
hierarchical mergers, and contribute significantly to the observed population,
must therefore be tuned to avoid a ""cluster catastrophe"" of overproducing
binary black hole mergers within and above the pair-instability mass gap.

Title:A trail of dark matter-free galaxies from a bullet dwarf collision,"
Abstract:  The ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and DF4 in the NGC1052 group share several
unusual properties: they both have large sizes, rich populations of
overluminous and large globular clusters, and very low velocity dispersions
indicating little or no dark matter. It has been suggested that these galaxies
were formed in the aftermath of high velocity encounters of gas rich galaxies,
events that resemble the collision that created the bullet cluster but on much
smaller scales. The gas separates from the dark matter in the collision and
subsequent star formation leads to the formation of one or more dark
matter-free galaxies. Here we show that the present-day line-of-sight distances
and radial velocities of DF2 and DF4 are consistent with their joint formation
in the aftermath of a single bullet-dwarf collision, around eight billion years
ago. Moreover, we find that DF2 and DF4 are part of an apparent linear
substructure of 7-11 large, low-luminosity objects. We propose that these all
originated in the same event, forming a trail of dark matter-free galaxies that
is more than 2 Mpc long and angled 7 +- 2 degrees from the line of sight. We
also tentatively identify the highly dark matter-dominated remnants of the two
progenitor galaxies that are expected at the leading edges of the trail.

Title:Hot white dwarf candidates from the IGAPS-GALEX cross-match,"
Abstract:  White dwarf (WD) stars are often associated with the central stars of
planetary nebulae (CSPNe) on their way to the cooling track. A large number of
WD star candidates have been identified thanks to optical large-scale surveys
such as Gaia DR2 and EDR3. However, hot-WD/CSPNe stars are quite elusive in
optical bands due to their high temperatures and low optical luminosities. The
Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) matched with the INT Galactic Plane Survey
(IGAPS) allowed us to identify hot-WD candidates by combining the GALEX far-UV
(FUV) and near-UV (NUV) with optical photometric bands (g, r, i and H$\alpha$).
After accounting for source confusion and filtering bad photometric data, a
total of 236485 sources were found in the GALEX and IGAPS footprint (GaPHAS). A
preliminary selection of hot stellar sources was made using the GALEX colour
cut on FUV-NUV>-0.53, yielding 74 hot-WD candidates. We analysed their spectral
energy distribution (SED) by developing a fitting program for single- and
two-body SED using an MCMC algorithm; 41 are probably binary systems (a binary
fraction of ~55% was estimated). Additionally, we classified the WD star
candidates using different infrared (IR) colours available for our sample
obtaining similar results as in the SED analysis for the single and binary
systems. This supports the strength of the fitting method and the advantages of
the combination of GALEX UV with optical photometry. Ground-based time-series
photometry and spectra are required in order to confirm the nature of the WD
star candidates.

Title:Weak evidence for variable occultation depth of 55 Cnc e with TESS,"
Abstract:  55 Cnc e is in a 0.73 day orbit transiting a Sun-like star. It has been
observed that the occultation depth of this Super-Earth, with a mass of
8$M_{\bigoplus}$ and radius of 2$R_{\bigoplus}$, changes significantly over
time at mid-infrared wavelengths. Observations with Spitzer measured a change
in its day-side brightness temperature of 1200 K, possibly driven by volcanic
activity, magnetic star-planet interaction, or the presence of a circumstellar
torus of dust. Previous evidence for the variability in occultation was in the
infrared range. Here we aim to explore if the variability exists also in the
optical. TESS observed 55 Cnc during sectors 21, 44 and 46. We carefully
detrend the data and fit a transit and occultation model for each sector in a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine. In a later stage we use the Leave-One-Out
Cross-Validation statistic to compare with a model of constant occultation for
the complete set and a model with no occultation. We report an occultation
depth of 8$\pm$2.5 ppm for the complete set of TESS observations. In
particular, we measured a depth of 15$\pm$4 ppm for sector 21, while for sector
44 we detect no occultation. In sector 46 we measure a weak occultation of
8$\pm$5 ppm. The occultation depth varies from one sector to the next between
1.6 and 3.4 $\sigma$ significance. We derive the possible contribution on
reflected light and thermal emission, setting an upper limit on the geometric
albedo. Based on our model comparison the presence of an occultation is
favoured considerably over no occultation, where the model with varying
occultation across sectors takes most of the statistical weight. Our analysis
confirms a detection of the occultation in TESS. Moreover, our results weakly
lean towards a varying occultation depth between each sector, while the transit
depth is constant across visits.

Title:GeV emission from a compact binary merger,"
Abstract:  An energetic $\rm \gamma$-ray burst (GRB), GRB 211211A, was observed on 2021
December 11 by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Despite its long duration,
typically associated with bursts produced by the collapse of massive stars, the
discovery of an optical-infrared kilonova and a quasi-periodic oscillation
during a gamma-ray precursor points to a compact object binary merger origin.
The complete understanding of this nearby ($\sim$ 1 billion light-years) burst
will significantly impact our knowledge of GRB progenitors and the physical
processes that lead to electromagnetic emission in compact binary mergers.
Here, we report the discovery of a significant ($\rm >5 \sigma$) transient-like
emission in the high-energy $\rm \gamma$-rays (HE; E$>0.1$ GeV) observed by
Fermi/LAT starting at $10^3$ s after the burst. After an initial phase with a
roughly constant flux ($\rm \sim 5\times 10^{-10}\ erg\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-2}$)
lasting $\sim 2\times 10^4$ s, the flux started decreasing and soon went
undetected. The multi-wavelength afterglow emission observed at such late times
is usually in good agreement with synchrotron emission from a relativistic
shock wave that arises as the GRB jet decelerates in the interstellar medium.
However, our detailed modelling of a rich dataset comprising public and
dedicated multi-wavelength observations demonstrates that GeV emission from GRB
211211A is in excess with respect to the expectation of this scenario. We
explore the possibility that the GeV excess is inverse Compton emission due to
the interaction of a long-lived, low-power jet with an external source of
photons. We discover that the kilonova emission can provide the necessary seed
photons for GeV emission in binary neutron star mergers.

paid and made to the K-Pg extinction event, the Chelyabinsk event,
extra-terrestrialization, terraforming, planetary defense, including the
emerging near-Earth object (NEO) observation and NEO impact avoidance
technologies and strategies. Furthermore, a framework of the Solar
Communication and Defense Networks (SCADN) with advanced algorithms and high
efficacy is proposed to enable an internet of distributed deep-space sensing,
communications, and defense to cope with disastrous incidents such as
asteroid/comet impacts. Furthermore, the perspectives on the legislation,
management, and supervision of founding the proposed SCADN are also discussed

Title:No evidence that the majority of black holes in binaries have zero spin,"
Abstract:  The spin properties of merging black holes observed with gravitational waves
can offer novel information about the origin of these systems. The magnitude
and orientations of black hole spins offer a record of binaries' evolutionary
history, encoding information about massive stellar evolution and the
astrophysical environments in which binary black holes are assembled. Recent
analyses of the binary black hole population have yielded conflicting portraits
of the black hole spin distribution. Some work suggests that black hole spins
are small but non-zero and exhibit a wide range of misalignment angles relative
to binaries' orbital angular momenta. Other work concludes that the majority of
black holes are non-spinning while the remainder are rapidly rotating and
primarily aligned with their orbits. We revisit these conflicting conclusions,
employing a variety of complementary methods to measure the distribution of
spin magnitudes and orientations among binary black hole mergers. We find that
the existence of a sub-population of black hole with vanishing spins is not
required by current data. Should such a sub-population exist, we conclude that
it must contain $\lesssim 60\%$ of binaries. Additionally, we find evidence for
significant spin-orbit misalignment among the binary black hole population,
with some systems exhibiting misalignment angles greater than $90^{\circ}$, and
see no evidence for an approximately spin-aligned sub-population.

Title:Particle Acceleration in Magnetic Reconnection with Ad hoc Pitch-angle Scattering,"
Abstract:  Particle acceleration during magnetic reconnection is a long-standing topic
in space, solar and astrophysical plasmas. Recent 3D particle-in-cell
simulations of magnetic reconnection show that particles can leave flux ropes
due to 3D field-line chaos, allowing particles to access additional
acceleration sites, gain more energy through Fermi acceleration, and develop a
power-law energy distribution. This 3D effect does not exist in traditional 2D
simulations, where particles are artificially confined to magnetic islands due
to their restricted motions across field lines. Full 3D simulations, however,
are prohibitively expensive for most studies. Here, we attempt to reproduce 3D
results in 2D simulations by introducing ad hoc pitch-angle scattering to a
small fraction of the particles. We show that scattered particles are able to
transport out of 2D islands and achieve more efficient Fermi acceleration,
leading to a significant increase of energetic particle flux. We also study how
the scattering frequency influences the nonthermal particle spectra. This study
helps achieve a complete picture of particle acceleration in magnetic
reconnection.

Title:MRI-driven dynamo at very high magnetic Prandtl numbers,"
Abstract:  The dynamo driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is believed to
play an important role in the dynamics of accretion discs and may also explain
the origin of the extreme magnetic fields present in magnetars. Its saturation
level is an important open question known to be particularly sensitive to the
diffusive processes through the magnetic Prandtl number Pm (the ratio of
viscosity to resistivity). Despite its relevance to proto-neutron stars and
neutron star merger remnants, the numerically challenging regime of high Pm is
still largely unknown. Using zero-net flux shearing box simulations in the
incompressible approximation, we studied MRI-driven dynamos at unprecedentedly
high values of Pm reaching 256. The simulations show that the stress and
turbulent energies are proportional to Pm up to moderately high values
($\mathrm{Pm} \sim 50$). At higher Pm, they transition to a new regime
consistent with a plateau independent of Pm for $\rm Pm \gtrsim 100$. This
trend is independent of the Reynolds number, which may suggest an asymptotic
regime where the energy injection and dissipation are independent of the
diffusive processes. Interestingly, large values of Pm not only lead to intense
small-scale magnetic fields but also to a more efficient dynamo at the largest
scales of the box.

Title:Modeling Stellar Surface Features on Subgiant Star with an M-dwarf Companion,"
Abstract:  Understanding magnetic activity on the surface of stars other than the Sun is
important for exoplanet analyses to properly characterize an exoplanet's
atmosphere and to further characterize stellar activity on a wide range of
stars. Modeling stellar surface features of a variety of spectral types and
rotation rates are key to understanding of the magnetic activity of these
stars. Using data from Kepler, we use the starspot modeling program STarSPot
(STSP) to measure the position and size of spots for KOI-340 which is an
eclipsing binary consisting of a subgiant star ($\rm T_{\rm eff} = 5593 \pm 27
K; R_{*} = 1.98 \pm 0.05 R_{\odot}$) with an M-dwarf companion ($M_{*} = 0.214
\pm 0.006 M_{\odot}$). STSP uses a novel technique to measure the spot
positions and radii by using the transiting secondary to study and model
individual active regions on the stellar surface using high-precision
photometry. We find the average size of spot features on KOI-340's primary is
$\sim$10% the radius of the star, i.e. two times larger than the mean size of
Solar-maximum sunspots. The spots on KOI-340 are present at every longitude and
show possible signs of differential rotation. The minimum fractional spotted
area of KOI-340's primary is $2\substack{+12\\ -2} \%$ while the spotted area
of the Sun is at most 0.2%. One transit of KOI-340 shows a signal in the
transit consistent with a plage; this plage occurs right before a dark spot
indicating the plage and spot might be co-located on the surface of the star.

Title:A proposed network of Gamma-ray Burst detectors on the Global Navigation Satellite System Galileo G2,"
Abstract:  The accurate localization of gamma-ray bursts remains a crucial task. While
historically, improved localization have led to the discovery of afterglow
emission and the realization of their cosmological distribution via redshift
measurements, a more recent requirement comes with the potential of studying
the kilonovae of neutron star mergers. Gravitational wave detectors are
expected to provide locations to not better than 10 square degrees over the
next decade. With their increasing horizon for merger detections also the
intensity of the gamma-ray and kilonova emission drops, making their
identification in large error boxes a challenge. Thus, a localization via the
gamma-ray emission seems to be the best chance to mitigate this problem. Here
we propose to equip some of the second generation Galileo satellites with
dedicated GRB detectors. This saves costs for launches and satellites for a
dedicated GRB network, the large orbital radius is beneficial for
triangulation, and perfect positional and timing accuracy come for free. We
present simulations of the triangulation accuracy, demonstrating that short
GRBs as faint as GRB 170817A can be localized to 1 degree radius (1 sigma).

Title:Constraints on annihilating dark matter in the Omega Centauri cluster,"
Abstract:  Recent gamma-ray and radio studies have obtained some stringent constraints
on annihilating dark matter properties. However, only a few studies have
focussed on using X-ray data to constrain annihilating dark matter. In this
article, we perform the X-ray analysis of annihilating dark matter using the
data of the Omega Centauri cluster. If dark matter is the correct
interpretation of the non-luminous mass component derived in the Omega Centauri
cluster, the conservative lower limits of thermal dark matter mass annihilating
via the $\tau^+\tau^-$, $b\bar{b}$ and $W^+W^-$ channels can be significantly
improved to 104(43) GeV, 650(167) GeV and 480(137) GeV respectively, assuming
the diffusion coefficient $D_0 \le 10^{26}(10^{27})$ cm$^2$/s. These
constraints can safely rule out the recent claims of dark matter interpretation
of the gamma-ray excess and anti-proton excess seen in our Galaxy. Generally
speaking, the conservative lower limits obtained for non-leptophilic
annihilation channels are much more stringent than that obtained by gamma-ray
analysis of nearby dwarf galaxies. We anticipate that this would open a new
window for constraining annihilating dark matter.

Title:Extreme eccentricities of triple systems: Analytic results,"
Abstract:  Triple stars and compact objects are ubiquitously observed in nature. Their
long-term evolution is complex; in particular, the von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK)
mechanism can potentially lead to highly eccentric encounters of the inner
binary. Such encounters can lead to a plethora of interacting binary phenomena,
as well as stellar and compact-object mergers. Here we find explicit analytical
formulae for the maximal eccentricity, $e_{\rm max}$, of the inner binary
undergoing ZLK oscillations, where both the test particle limit (parametrised
by the inner-to-outer angular momentum ratio $\eta$) and the double-averaging
approximation (parametrised by the period ratio, $\epsilon_{\rm SA}$) are
relaxed, for circular outer orbits. We recover known results in both limiting
cases (either $\eta$ or $\epsilon_{\rm SA} \to 0$) and verify the validity of
our model using numerical simulations. We test our results with two accurate
numerical N-body codes, $\texttt{Rebound}$ for Newtonian dynamics and
$\texttt{Tsunami}$ for general-relativistic (GR) dynamics, and find excellent
correspondence. We discuss the implications of our results for stellar triples
and both stellar and supermassive triple black hole mergers.

Cyg with Tomo-e Gozen/1.05 m Kiso Schmidt and Neutron star Interior Composition
ExploreR (it NICER) / International Space Station (ISS). A total of four
observations were carried out in the quiescent state and highly correlated
light variations between the two wavelengths were detected. We have extracted
local brightness peaks in the light curves with a binning interval of 1 sec,
called `shots', and have evaluated time lags between the optical and X-ray
variations by using a cross-correlation function. Some shots exhibit
significant optical lags to X-ray variations and most of them are positive
ranging from $+$0.26 to 3.11 sec, which have never been detected.
They may be ascribable to X-ray reprocessing in the accretion disk and/or the
secondary star. This analysis is possible thanks to the high timing accuracy
and the high throughput of NICER and the matching capability of Tomo-e Gozen.
Also, it is confirmed that the correlation between the optical and X-ray
variations changed in the middle of one of our observation windows and the
X-ray spectrum softer than 2 keV varied in accordance with the correlation.

Title:Categorize Radio Interference using component and temporal analysis,"
Abstract:  Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a significant challenge faced by
today's radio astronomers. While most past efforts were devoted to cleaning the
RFI from the data, we develop a novel method for categorizing and cataloguing
RFI for forensic purpose. We present a classifier that categorizes RFI into
different types based on features extracted using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and Fourier analysis. The classifier can identify narrowband non-periodic
RFI above 2 sigma, narrowband periodic RFI above 3 sigma, and wideband
impulsive RFI above 5 sigma with F1 scores between 0.87 and 0.91 in simulation.
This classifier could be used to identify the sources of RFI as well as to
clean RFI contamination (particularly in pulsar search). In the long-term
analysis of the categorized RFI, we found a special type of drifting periodic
RFI that is detrimental to pulsar search. We also found evidences of an
increased rate of impulsive RFI when the telescope is pointing toward the
cities. These results demonstrate this classifier's potential as a forensic
tool for RFI environment monitoring of radio telescopes.

Title:Can MAD accretion disks launching structured jets explain both GRB and AGN engines? Magnetically arrested accretion disks launching structured jets in application to GRB and AGN engines,"
Abstract:  We explore the formation, energetics, and geometry of relativistic jets along
with the variability of their central engine. We study both fast and slowly
rotating black holes and address our simulations to active galaxy (AGN) centers
and gamma ray burst (GRB) engines. The structured jets are postulated to
account for emission properties of high energy sources across the mass scale,
launched from stellar mass black holes in GRBs and from supermassive black
holes in AGNs. Their active cores contain magnetized accretion disks and
rotation of the Kerr black hole provides a mechanism for jet launching. This
process works most effectively if the mode of accretion is magnetically
arrested (MAD). In this mode, the modulation of jets launched from the engine
is related to internal instabilities in the accretion flow that operate on
smallest time and spatial scales. As these scales are related to the
light-crossing time and the black hole gravitational radius, the universal
model of jet-disk connection is expected to scale with the black hole mass. We
investigate the jet-disk connection by means of 3D GR MHD simulations of the
MAD accretion in Kerr metric. We quantify the variability of the disk by means
of a Fourier analysis. We found that the evolution is governed by the physical
parameters of the engine such as the black hole spin and disk size as well as
its magnetization, and we applied our scenarios to typical types of sources in
AGN and GRB classes. We found that the MAD scenario is applicable to AGN
engines and supports persistent jet emission. It can also be applied to GRBs,
as it gives the variability pattern roughly consistent with observations.
However, in some cases, strong magnetic fields may lead to jet quenching, and
this effect is found to be important mainly for GRB jets. We speculate that it
may be related to the strength of magnetically driven winds from the GRB
engines.

Title:Identification of Grand-design and Flocculent Spirals from SDSS using Convolutional Neural network,"
Abstract:  Spiral galaxies can be classified into the {\it Grand-designs} and {\it
Flocculents} based on the nature of their spiral arms. The {\it Grand-designs}
exhibit almost continuous and high contrast spiral arms and are believed to be
driven by density waves, while the {\it Flocculents} have patchy and
low-contrast spiral features and are primarily stochastic in origin. We train a
convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify spirals into {\it
Grand-designs} and {\it Flocculents}, with a testing accuracy of
$\mathrm{97.2\%}$. We then use the above model for classifying $\mathrm{1,354}$
new spirals from the SDSS. Out of these, $\mathrm{721}$ were identified as {\it
Flocculents}, and the rest as {\it Grand-designs}. We find the median
asymptotic rotational velocities of our newly classified {\it Grand-designs}
and {\it Flocculents} are $218 \pm 86$ and $145 \pm 67$ respectively,
indicating that the {\it Grand-designs} are mostly the high-mass and the {\it
Flocculents} the intermediate-mass spirals. This is further corroborated by the
observation that the median morphological indices of the {\it Grand-designs}
and {\it Flocculents} are $2.6 \pm 1.8$ and $4.7 \pm 1.9$ respectively,
implying that the {\it Flocculents} primarily consist of a late-type galaxy
population in contrast to the {\it Grand-designs}. Finally, an almost equal
fraction of of bars $\sim$ 0.3 in both the classes of spiral galaxies reveals
that the presence of a bar component does not regulate the type of spiral arm
hosted by a galaxy. Our results may have important implications for formation
and evolution of spiral arms in galaxies.

that the photospheric emission can well describe the radiation spectrum of this

16 yr. Results: Faint, extremely redshifted maser emission located close to the
presumed central star position and coincident with the radio jet shows flaring
activity with a period of ~ 5 yr. Flares have an asymmetric profile with a

velocity of the flaring cloudlets drifts at a rate of 3-4 * 10^-5 km/s/d for

Title:Evaluating Non-LTE Spectral Inversions with ALMA and IBIS,"
Abstract:  We present observations of a solar plage in the millimeter-continuum with the
ALMA and in the Ca 8542 and Na 5896 spectral lines with the Interferometric
BIdimensional Spectrometer (IBIS). Our goal is to compare the measurement of
local gas temperatures provided by ALMA with the temperature diagnostics
provided by non-LTE inversions using STIC. In performing these inversions, we
find that using column mass as the reference height scale, rather than optical
depth, provides more reliable atmospheric profiles above the temperature
minimum and that the treatment of non- LTE hydrogen ionization brings the
inferred chromospheric temperatures into better agreement with the ALMA
measurements. The Band 3 brightness temperatures are higher but well correlated
with the inversion-derived temperatures at the height of formation of the Ca
8542 line core. The Band 6 temperatures instead do not show good correlations
with the temperatures at any specific layer in the inverted atmospheres. We
then performed inversions that included the millimeter continuum intensities as
an additional constraint. Incorporating Band 3 generally resulted in
atmospheres showing a strong temperature rise in the upper atmosphere, while
including Band 6 led to significant regions of anomalously low temperatures at
chromospheric heights. This is consistent with the idea that the Band 6
emission can come from a range of heights. The poor constraints on the
chromospheric electron density with existing inversion codes introduces
difficulties in determining the height(s) of formation of the millimeter
continuum as well as uncertainties in the temperatures derived from the
spectral lines.

Title:Accretion rates in hierarchical triple systems with discs,"
Abstract:  Young multiple systems accrete most of their final mass in the first few Myr
of their lifetime, during the protostellar and protoplanetary phases. Previous
studies showed that in binary systems the majority of the accreted mass falls
onto the lighter star, thus evolving to mass equalisation. However, young
stellar systems often comprise more than two stars, which are expected to be in
hierarchical configurations. Despite its astrophysical relevance, differential
accretion in hierarchical systems remains to be understood. In this work, we
investigate whether the accretion trends expected in binaries are valid for
higher order multiples. We performed a set of 3D Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics simulations of binaries and of hierarchical triples (HTs)
embedded in an accretion disc, with the code Phantom. We identify for the first
time accretion trends in HTs and their deviations compared to binaries. These
deviations, due to the interaction of the small binary with the infalling
material from the circum-triple disc, can be described with a semi-analytical
prescription. Generally, the smaller binary of a HT accretes more mass than a
single star of the same mass as the smaller binary. We found that in a HT, if
the small binary is heavier than the third body, the standard differential
accretion scenario (whereby the secondary accretes more of the mass) is
hampered. Reciprocally, if the small binary is lighter than the third body, the
standard differential accretion scenario is enhanced. The peculiar differential
accretion mechanism we find in HTs is expected to affect their mass ratio
distribution.

Title:A sparse regression approach for populating dark matter halos and subhalos with galaxies,"
Abstract:  We use sparse regression methods (SRM) to build accurate and explainable
models that predict the stellar mass of central and satellite galaxies as a
function of properties of their host dark matter halos. SRM are machine
learning algorithms that provide a framework for modelling the governing
equations of a system from data. In contrast with other machine learning
algorithms, the solutions of SRM methods are simple and depend on a relatively
small set of adjustable parameters. We collect data from 35,459 galaxies from
the EAGLE simulation using 19 redshift slices between $z=0$ and $z=4$ to
parameterize the mass evolution of the host halos. Using an appropriate
formulation of input parameters, our methodology can model satellite and
central halos using a single predictive model that achieves the same accuracy
as when predicted separately. This allows us to remove the somewhat arbitrary
distinction between those two galaxy types and model them based only on their
halo growth history. Our models can accurately reproduce the total galaxy
stellar mass function and the stellar mass-dependent galaxy correlation
functions ($\xi(r)$) of EAGLE. We show that our SRM model predictions of
$\xi(r)$ is competitive with those from sub-halo abundance matching and
performs better than results from extremely randomized trees. We suggest SRM as
an encouraging approach for populating the halos of dark matter only
simulations with galaxies and for generating mock catalogues that can be used
to explore galaxy evolution or analyse forthcoming large-scale structure
surveys.

Title:Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper IX. The solar-type system KIC 5359678,"
Abstract:  KIC 5359678 is a 6.231-d period F-type eclipsing binary system whose
component stars both show starspot activity. It was observed by the Kepler
satellite in long cadence for the full four-year duration of the mission. Wang
et al (2021) obtained radial velocity measurements of the two stars and
analysed these plus the Kepler data to study their spot activity and measure
their physical properties, but left several questions unanswered. We have
performed an independent analysis and determined the masses (1.252 +/- 0.018
and 1.065 +/- 0.013 Msun) and radii (1.449 +/- 0.012 and 1.048 +/- 0.017 Rsun)
of the stars to high precision. The distance we find to the system is slightly
shorter than that from Gaia EDR3 for unknown reason(s). We also investigated
the precision of the numerical integration applied to the model light curve to
match the 1765-s sampling cadence of the Kepler observations. We found that
ignoring this temporal smearing leads to biased radius measurements for the
stars: that for the primary is too small by 4 sigma and that for the secondary
is too large by 10 sigma. Doubling the sampling rate of the model light curve
is sufficient to remove most of this bias, but for precise results a minimum of
five samples per observed datapoint is required.

Title:Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper X. The pulsating B-type system V1388 Orionis,"
Abstract:  V1388 Ori is an early-B type detached eclipsing binary whose physical
properties have previously been measured from dedicated spectroscopy and a
ground-based survey light curve. We reconsider the properties of the system
using newly-available light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS). We discover two frequencies in the system, at 2.99 d$^{-1}$
and 4.00 d$^{-1}$ which are probably due to beta Cephei or slowly-pulsating
B-star pulsations. A large number of additional significant frequencies exist
at multiples of the orbital frequency, 0.4572 d$^{-1}$. We are not able to find
a fully satisfactory model of the eclipses, but the best attempts show highly
consistent values for the fitted parameters. We find masses of 7.24 +/- 0.08
Msun and 5.03 +/- 0.04 Msun, and radii of 5.30 +/- 0.07 Rsun and 3.14 +/- 0.06
Rsun. The properties of the system are in good agreement with the predictions
of theoretical stellar evolutionary models and the Gaia EDR3 parallax if the
published temperature estimates are revised downwards by 1500 K, to 19000 K for
the larger and more massive star and 17000 K for its companion.

Title:Modeling the thermal conduction in the solar atmosphere with the code MANCHA3D,"
Abstract:  Thermal conductivity is one of the important mechanisms of heat transfer in
the solar corona. In the limit of strongly magnetized plasma, it is typically
modeled by Spitzer's expression where the heat flux is aligned with the
magnetic field. This paper describes the implementation of the heat conduction
into the code MANCHA3D with an aim of extending single-fluid MHD simulations
from the upper convection zone into the solar corona. Two different schemes to
model heat conduction are implemented: (1) a standard scheme where a parabolic
term is added to the energy equation, and (2) a scheme where the hyperbolic
heat flux equation is solved. The first scheme limits the time step due to the
explicit integration of a parabolic term, which makes the simulations
computationally expensive. The second scheme solves the limitations on the time
step by artificially limiting the heat conduction speed to computationally
manageable values. The validation of both schemes is carried out with standard
tests in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. Furthermore, we implement the
model for heat flux derived by Braginskii (1965) in its most general form, when
the expression for the heat flux depends on the ratio of the collisional to
cyclotron frequencies of the plasma, and, therefore on the magnetic field
strength. Additionally, our implementation takes into account the heat
conduction in parallel, perpendicular, and transverse directions, and provides
the contributions from ions and electrons separately. The model also
transitions smoothly between field-aligned conductivity and isotropic
conductivity for regions with a low or null magnetic field. Finally, we present
a two-dimensional test for heat conduction using realistic values of the solar
atmosphere where we prove the robustness of the two schemes implemented.

"Title:Nano meter Size Dirty Dark Matter Pearls, electron-signal, IMP or SIDM, not WIMP","
Abstract:  Through several articles we have developed a model for dark matter as
consisting of bubbles of a new (speculated) type of vacuum, starting from
cm-sized pearls or balls down to atomic size ones and now we believe they have
nanometer sizes. In the latest development of our model we have the bubbles of
the new vacuum imbedded in dust grains very similar to the grains present in
interstellar and intergalactic space anyway, although the presence of the
bubble with a very large homolumo gap in its single electron spectrum
influences the dust grain material so as to become denser and harder. We have
earlier explained how our dark matter particles get stopped in the shielding,
so that normally expected nucleonic collisions are not observable. The signal
of the dark matter in the underground experiments rather becomes decays of
excited particles actually with the energy of the homolumo gap, which is also
equal to the photon energy of the X-ray line presumably observed astronomically
from galaxy clusters etc. A new calculation here is a fitting of the velocity
dependence of the dark matter self-interaction as estimated by Correa [15],
using deviations from the only gravitationally interacting dark matter in dwarf
galaxies. Let us stress that apart from the speculated new vacuum we have no
new physics, and if the couplings in the Standard Model were adjusted to make
degenerate vacua as speculated according to our Multiple Point Principle (MPP)
we would only need the Standard Model, so dark matter would not require new
physics.

Abstract:  Displacement sensors have a variety of applications within gravitational wave
detectors. The seismic isolation chain of the LIGO core optics utilises optical

Title:Active galactic nuclei jets simulated with smoothed particle hydrodynamics,"
Abstract:  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets play an important role as a feedback
mechanism that quenches the growth of massive galaxies. These jets have so far
been simulated almost exclusively with grid-based codes. In this work we
present results from hydrodynamical tests of AGN jets simulated with the SWIFT
code and its implementation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We reach
numerical resolutions of more than a million particles per jet, unprecedented
for an SPH code. In all cases we find broad agreement between our jets and
theoretical predictions for the jet and lobe lengths and widths. At very low
resolutions, typical of low-resolution cosmological simulations
($m_\mathrm{gas}\approx10^7$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), the shape of the lobes is
close to self-similar ones at a level of $15\%$ accuracy. This indicates that
the basics of jet lobe physics can be captured even at such resolutions
($\approx500$ particles per jet). The jets first evolve ballistically, and then
transition to a self-similar phase, during which the kinetic and thermal
energies in the lobes and the shocked ambient medium are constant fractions of
the total injected energy. In our standard simulation, two thirds of the
initially injected energy is transferred to the ambient medium by the point the
jets are turned off, mainly through a bow shock. Of that, three quarters is in
thermal form, indicating that the bow shock thermalizes efficiently. We find
that jet launching velocity and power, in addition to determining the
temperature, mass and overall length of the jets, also play an important role
in the resolution of the jets.

Title:Tell-Tale Spectral Signatures of MHD-driven Ultra-Fast Outflows in AGNs,"
Abstract:  We aim to explore spectral signatures of the predicted multi-ion UFOs in the
broadband X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by exploiting an
accretion disk wind model in the context of a simple magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
framework. We are focused primarily on examining the spectral dependences on a
number of key properties; (1) ionizing luminosity ratio $\lambda_{\rm ion}$,
(2) line-of-sight wind density slope $p$, (3) optical/UV-to-X-ray strength
$\alpha_{\rm OX}$, (4) inclination $\theta$, (5) X-ray photon index $\Gamma$
and (6) wind density factor $f_D$. With an emphasis on radio-quiet Seyferts in
sub-Eddington regime, multi-ion UFO spectra are systematically calculated as a
function of these parameters to show that MHD-driven UFOs imprint a unique
asymmetric absorption line profile with a pronounced blue tail structure on
average. Such a characteristic line signature is generic to the simplified MHD
disk-wind models presented in this work due to their specific kinematics and
density structure. The properties of these absorption line profiles could be
utilized as a diagnostics to distinguish between different wind driving
mechanisms or even the specific values of a given MHD wind parameters. We also
present high fidelity microcalorimeter simulations in anticipation of the
upcoming {\it XRISM}/Resolve and {\it Athena}/X-IFU instruments to demonstrate
that such a ""tell-tale"" sign may be immune to a spectral contamination by the
presence of additional warm absorbers and partially covering gas.

reveal a linear polarization degree of $(12\pm 1)\%$ throughout the IXPE 2--8
keV band. We detect a substantial variation of the polarization with energy:
the degree is $(14\pm 1)\%$ at 2--4 keV and $(41\pm 7)\%$ at 5.5--8 keV, while
it drops below the instrumental sensitivity around 4--5 keV, where the
polarization angle swings by $\sim 90^\circ$. The IXPE observations give us
completely new information about the properties of the neutron star surface and
magnetosphere and lend further support to the presence of the quantum
mechanical effect of vacuum birefringence.

Title:The 3D Galactocentric velocities of Kepler stars: marginalizing over missing RVs,"
Abstract:  Precise Gaia measurements of positions, parallaxes, and proper motions
provide an opportunity to calculate 3D positions and 2D velocities (i.e. 5D
phase-space) of Milky Way stars. Where available, spectroscopic radial velocity
(RV) measurements provide full 6D phase-space information, however there are
now and will remain many stars without RV measurements. Without an RV it is not
possible to directly calculate 3D stellar velocities, however one can infer 3D
stellar velocities by marginalizing over the missing RV dimension. In this
paper, we infer the 3D velocities of stars in the Kepler field in Cartesian
Galactocentric coordinates (vx, vy, vz). We directly calculate velocities for
around a quarter of all Kepler targets, using RV measurements available from
the Gaia, LAMOST and APOGEE spectroscopic surveys. Using the velocity
distributions of these stars as our prior, we infer velocities for the
remaining three-quarters of the sample by marginalizing over the RV dimension.
The median uncertainties on our inferred vx, vy, and vz velocities are around
4, 18, and 4 km/s, respectively. We provide 3D velocities for a total of
148,590 stars in the Kepler field. These 3D velocities could enable kinematic
age-dating, Milky Way stellar population studies, and other scientific studies
using the benchmark sample of well-studied Kepler stars. Although the
methodology used here is broadly applicable to targets across the sky, our
prior is specifically constructed from and for the Kepler field. Care should be
taken to use a suitable prior when extending this method to other parts of the
Galaxy.

Title:The origin of the [CII]-deficit in a simulated dwarf galaxies starburst,"
Abstract:  We present [CII] synthetic observations of smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) simulations of a dwarf galaxy merger. The merging process varies the
star-formation rate by more than three orders of magnitude. Several star
clusters are formed, the feedback of which disperses and unbinds the dense gas
through expanding HII regions and supernova (SN) explosions. For galaxies with
properties similar to the modelled ones, we find that the [CII] emission
remains optically thin throughout the merging process. We identify the Warm
Neutral Medium ($3<\log T_{\rm gas}<4$ with $\chi_{\rm HI}>2\chi_{\rm H2}$) to
be the primary source of [CII] emission ($\sim58\%$ contribution), although at
stages when the HII regions are young and dense (during star cluster formation
or SNe in the form of ionized bubbles) they can contribute $\gtrsim50\%$ to the
total [CII] emission. We find that the [CII]/FIR ratio decreases due to thermal
saturation of the [CII] emission caused by strong FUV radiation fields emitted
by the massive star clusters, leading to a [CII]-deficit medium. We investigate
the [CII]-SFR relation and find an approximately linear correlation which
agrees well with observations, particularly those from the Dwarf Galaxy Survey.
Our simulation reproduces the observed trends of [CII]/FIR versus $\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm FIR}$, and it agrees well with the Kennicutt relation of
SFR-FIR luminosity. We propose that local peaks of [CII] in resolved
observations may provide evidence for ongoing massive cluster formation.

Title:Hierarchical Merger of Primordial Black Holes in Dwarf Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We study the merger history of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a scenario
where they represent the dominant dark matter component of a typical dwarf
galaxies' core. We investigate the possibility of a sequence of collisions
resulting in a hierarchical merger of black holes and look at the final mass
spectrum in such {\it clusters}, which initially present a monochromatic
(single-mass) PBH population. Our study shows that the merging process results
in the transfer of about $40\%$ of the total mass of the core to the merger
products regardless of the initial mass of PBHs, with about $5\%$ of energy
radiated out in the form of gravitational waves. We find that, in the lighter
mass limit, black holes up to eight times more massive than the original
population can be formed within a Hubble time.

Title:The impact of extragalactic foregrounds on internal delensing of CMB B-mode polarization,"
Abstract:  The search for primordial $B$-mode polarization of the CMB is limited by the
sample variance of $B$-modes produced at later times by gravitational lensing.
Constraints can be improved by `delensing': using some proxy of the matter
distribution to partially remove the lensing-induced $B$-modes. Current and
soon-upcoming experiments will infer a matter map -- at least in part -- from
the temperature anisotropies of the CMB. These reconstructions are contaminated
by extragalactic foregrounds: radio-emitting galaxies, the cosmic infrared
background, or the Sunyaev--Zel'dovich effects. Using the Websky simulations,
we show that the foregrounds add spurious power to the angular auto-spectrum of
delensed $B$-modes via non-Gaussian higher-point functions, biasing constraints
on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. We consider an idealized experiment similar
to the Simons Observatory, with no Galactic or atmospheric foregrounds. After
removing point sources detectable at 143 GHz and reconstructing lensing from
CMB temperature modes $l<3500$ using a Hu-Okamoto quadratic estimator (QE), we
infer a value of $r$ that is $1.5\,\sigma$ higher than the true $r=0$.
Reconstructing instead from a minimum-variance ILC map only exacerbates the
problem, bringing the bias above $3\,\sigma$. When the $TT$ estimator is
co-added with other QEs or with external matter tracers, new couplings ensue
which partially cancel the diluted bias from $TT$. We provide a simple and
effective prescription to model these effects. In addition, we demonstrate that
the point-source-hardened or shear-only QEs can not only mitigate the biases to
acceptable levels, but also lead to lower power than the Hu-Okamoto QE after
delensing. Thus, temperature-based reconstructions remain powerful tools in the
quest to measure $r$.

Title:Voids and Halo in Voids statistics as a probe of the Expansion History of the Universe,"
Abstract:  The structures in the Universe are distributed in the cosmic web. The
structures' distribution, statistics, and evolution can be considered probes of
cosmological models. We investigate the number density of voids and dark matter
halo-in-voids in the Excursion Set Theory (EST). We study both the spherical
and ellipsoidal collapse models in the Markov and non-Markov frameworks of the
EST. Then, we compare the number density of voids and halo-in-voids in standard
$\Lambda$CDM and reconstructed model. The reconstructed model is a
model-independent expansion history reconstruction from background
observations. In this work, the effect of the collapse model barrier in
exclusion of the trajectories in EST is explored. This exclusion affects the
statistics of voids and the halo-in-voids. We show that the statistic of the
voids in the non-Markov extension of EST is almost independent of the collapse
model. Finally, we show that the number density of halo-in-voids can
distinguish these two models and address the anomalies such as void phenomena.

Abstract:  We report on the discovery and characterisation of three planets orbiting the

The two outer planets have periods of $\rm 56.0067 \pm 0.0003~days$ and $\rm

while c and d are both under-dense. We also demonstrate that the two outer

Abstract:  The observational high-resolution data on the $HI$ gas disk rotation curve of
the spiral galaxy $NGC\;6946$ at large radii and the recent increased amount
and quality of data on linearly polarized radio continuum emission for this

the rotation of gas and to test whether disk magnetic fields should be
considered as a non-negligible dynamical ingredient. The spiral galaxy
$NGC\;6946$ hosts two symmetric bright magnetic spiral arms which have been
revealed in the radio polarization map. By taking into account the dynamical
effect of the regular magnetic fields caused by two main magnetic arms, on the
circular gas rotation and considering two dark matter mass density models, ISO
and the universal NFW profile, the shape of the $HI$ gas rotation curve of this

regular magnetic fields in the rotation velocity of the gas has a positive

pattern and the highest magnetic field strength, with the field directed
towards the galaxy's center in both, almost compatible with two inner main
magnetic arms detected in the polarized synchrotron intensity map.

Title:Three-dimensional extinction maps: Inverting inter-calibrated extinction catalogues,"
Abstract:  3D maps of the extinction density in the Galaxy can be built through the
inversion of catalogues of distance-extinction pairs for individual target
stars. The spatial resolution of the maps that can be achieved increases with
the spatial density of the targets, and subsequently with the combination of
catalogues. However, this requires their careful inter-calibration. Our aim is
to develop methods of inter-calibration of two different catalogues. We used as
reference a spectrophotometric catalogue. A principal component analysis was
performed in G,GB,GR,J,H,K multi-colour space for the second catalog. The
subspace constituted by the two first components was split into cells in which
we estimated deviations from the reference. The deviations were computed using
all targets from the reference located at a short spatial distance of each
secondary target. Corrections and filtering were deduced for each cell in the
multi-colour space. We applied the technique to two different datasets: on the
one hand, the spectrophotometric catalogue, and, on the other hand, a catalogue
of extinctions based on photometry of Gaia eDR3 and 2MASS. After calibration,
the dispersion of the extinction among neighbouring points in the second
catalogue is reduced, regardless of whether reference targets are present
locally. Weak structures are then more apparent. The extinction of high
Galactic latitude targets is more tightly correlated with the dust emission, a
property acquired from the first catalogue. A hierarchical inversion technique
was applied to the two merged inter-calibrated catalogues to produce 3D
extinction density maps corresponding to different volumes and maximum spatial
resolution. The maximum resolution is 10pc for a 3000x3000x800pc3 volume around
the Sun, and the maximum size of the maps is 10x10x0.8 kpc3 for a resolution of
50pc. Maps can be downloaded or used by means of on-line tools.

Title:Polar regions activity and the prediction of the height of the solar cycle 25,"
Abstract:  The forthcoming solar cycle (SC) 25 was beleived to be rather low when using
the sunspot number (SN) as a measurement of the level of activity. The most
popular prediction was made by the panel of NASA in 2019, including works based
on extrapolations of dynamo-type models. We however discovered that using
different observations to measure the level of polar regions activity several
years before the start of SC25 and also after the start of the SC25 in 2020,
the height of the SC25 could be high. The polar regions activity we considered
seems related to the polar coronal holes (CH) activity and it is found
significantly higher before the SC25 that it was before the SC24 and
accordingly, we suggest that the SN cycle could indeed be much higher than
during the SC24 that was a low SN height cycle.

Title:Astrometry in two-photon interferometry using Earth rotation fringe scan,"
Abstract:  Optical interferometers may not require a phase-stable optical link between
the stations if instead sources of quantum-mechanically entangled pairs could
be provided to them, enabling long baselines. We developed a new variation of
this idea, proposing that photons from two different astronomical sources could
be interfered at two decoupled stations. Interference products can then be
calculated in post-processing or requiring only a slow, classical connection
between stations. In this work, we investigated practical feasibility of this
approach. We developed a Bayesian analysis method for the earth rotation fringe
scanning technique and showed that in the limit of high signal-to-noise ratio
it reproduced the results from a simple Fisher matrix analysis. We identify
candidate stair pairs in the northern hemisphere, where this technique could be
applied. With two telescopes with an effective collecting area of $\sim 2$
m$^2$, we could detect fringing and measure the astrometric separation of the
sources at $\sim 10\,\mu$as precision in a few hours of observations, in
agreement with previous estimates.

Title:Linear Point Standard Ruler: cosmological forecasts for future galaxy surveys. Toward consistent BAO analyses far from a fiducial cosmology,"
Abstract:  The linear point (LP) standard ruler was identified as the basis of a purely
geometric method for exploiting the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The LP
exploits the BAO feature imprinted in the galaxy two-point correlation function
to measure cosmological distances independent of any specific cosmological
model. We forecast the expected precision of future and ongoing spectroscopic
galaxy surveys to measure distances leveraging the linear point. We investigate
the cosmological implications of our forecasted results. We focus in particular
on a relevant working example: the detection of the late-time cosmic
acceleration independent of other cosmological probes. Our findings show that,
even within the LCDM standard cosmological paradigm, estimated distances need
to be reliable over a very wide parameter range in order to realize their
maximum utility. This is particularly relevant if we aim to properly
characterize cosmological tensions. The LP is a promising candidate approach to
achieve this reliability. In contrast, widely employed procedures in BAO
analysis estimate distances keeping fixed cosmological parameters to fiducial
values close to cosmic-microwave-background constraints in flat-LCDM. It is
unclear whether they are purely geometric methods. Moreover, they rely on
untested extrapolations to explore the parameter space away from those fiducial
flat-LCDM values. We recommend that all BAO methodologies be validated across
the full range of models and parameters over which their results are quoted,
first by means of linear predictions and then N-body simulations.

Title:A study of globular clusters in a lenticular galaxy in Hydra I from deep HST/ACS photometry,"
Abstract:  We take advantage of exquisitely deep optical imaging data from HST/ACS in
the F475W ($g_{F475W}$) and F606W ($V_{F606W}$) bands, to study the properties
of the globular cluster (GC) population in the intermediate mass lenticular
galaxy PGC 087327, in the Hydra I galaxy cluster. We inspect the photometric
(magnitudes and color) and morphometric (compactness, elongation, etc.)
properties of sources lying in an area of $\sim19\times19$ kpc centered on PGC
087327, and compare them with four neighbouring fields over the same HST/ACS
mosaic. This allowed us to identify a list of GC candidates and to inspect
their properties using a background decontamination method. Relative to the
four comparison fields, PGC 087327 shows a robust overdensity of GCs,
$N_{GC}=82\pm9$. At the estimated magnitude of the galaxy, this number implies
a specific frequency of $S_N=1.8\pm0.7$. In spite of the short wavelength
interval available with the $g_{F475W}$ and $V_{F606W}$ passbands, the color
distribution shows a clear bimodality with a blue peak at $\langle
g_{F475W}{-}V_{F606W} \rangle =0.47\pm0.05$ mag and a red peak at $\langle
g_{F475W}{-}V_{F606W}\rangle =0.62\pm0.03$ mag. We also observe the typical
steeper slope of the radial distribution of red GCs relative to blue ones.
Thanks to the unique depth of the available data, we characterize the GC
luminosity function (GCLF) well beyond the expected GCLF turn-over. We find
$g^{TOM}_{F475W} = 26.54\pm0.10$ mag and $V^{TOM}_{F606W} = 26.08 \pm 0.09$
mag, which after calibration yields a distance of $D_{GCLF} = 56.7 \pm
4.3(statistical) \pm 5.2(systematic)$ Mpc.

Title:Estimating the warm dark matter mass from strong lensing images with truncated marginal neural ratio estimation,"
Abstract:  Precision analysis of galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing images
provides a unique way of characterizing small-scale dark matter halos, and
could allow us to uncover the fundamental properties of dark matter's
constituents. In recent years, gravitational imaging techniques made it
possible to detect a few heavy subhalos. However, gravitational lenses contain
numerous subhalos and line-of-sight halos, whose subtle imprint is extremely
difficult to detect individually. Existing methods for marginalizing over this
large population of sub-threshold perturbers in order to infer population-level
parameters are typically computationally expensive, or require compressing
observations into hand-crafted summary statistics, such as a power spectrum of
residuals. In this work we present the first analysis pipeline to combine
parametric lensing models and a recently-developed neural simulation-based
inference technique called truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE)
to constrain the warm dark matter halo mass function cutoff scale directly from
multiple lensing images. Through a proof-of-concept application to simulated
data, we show that our approach enables empirically testable inference of the
dark matter cutoff mass through marginalization over a large population of
realistic perturbers that would be undetectable on their own, and over lens and
source parameters uncertainties. To obtain our results, we combine the signal
contained in a set of images with Hubble Space Telescope resolution. Our
results suggest that TMNRE can be a powerful approach to put tight constraints
on the mass of warm dark matter in the multi-keV regime, which will be relevant
both for existing lensing data and in the large sample of lenses that will be
delivered by near-future telescopes.

Title:Discovery of optical and infrared accretion disc wind signatures in the black hole candidate MAXI J1348-630,"
Abstract:  MAXI J1348-630 is a low mass X-ray binary discovered in 2019 during a bright
outburst. During this event, the system sampled both hard and soft states
following the standard evolution. We present multi-epoch optical and
near-infrared spectroscopy obtained with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope.
Our dataset includes spectra taken during the brightest phases of the outburst
as well as the decay towards quiescence. We study the evolution of the main
emission lines, paying special attention to the presence of features commonly
associated with accretion disc winds, such as blue-shifted absorptions, broad
emission line wings and flat-top profiles. We find broad emission line wings in
H-alpha during the hard-to-soft transition and blue-shifted absorption troughs
at ~-500 km/s in H-beta, HeI-5876, H-alpha and Pa-beta during the bright
soft-intermediate state. In addition, flat-top profiles are seen throughout the
outburst. We interpret these observables as signatures of a cold (i.e. optical
to infrared) accretion disc wind present in the system. We discuss the
properties of the wind and compare them with those seen in other X-ray
transients. In particular, the wind velocity that we observe is low when
compared to those of other systems, which might be a direct consequence of the
relatively low binary inclination, as suggested by several observables. This
study strengthen the hypothesis that cold winds are a common feature in low
mass X-ray binaries and that they can also be detected in low inclination
objects via high-quality optical and infrared spectroscopy.

Title:Tucana B: A Potentially Isolated and Quenched Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy at D$\approx$1.4 Mpc,"
Abstract:  We report the discovery of Tucana B, an isolated ultra-faint dwarf galaxy at
a distance of D=1.4 Mpc. Tucana B was found during a search for ultra-faint
satellite companions to the known dwarfs in the outskirts of the Local Group,
although its sky position and distance indicate the nearest galaxy to be
$\sim$500 kpc distant. Deep ground-based imaging resolves Tucana B into stars,
and it displays a sparse red giant branch consistent with an old, metal poor
stellar population analogous to that seen in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies of
the Milky Way, albeit at fainter apparent magnitudes. Tucana B has a half-light
radius of 80$\pm$40 pc, and an absolute magnitude of
$M_V$=$-$6.9$^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ mag ($L_V$=$(5^{+4}_{-2})\times$10$^4$
$L_{\odot}$), which is again comparable to the Milky Way's ultra-faint
satellites. There is no evidence for a population of young stars, either in the
optical color magnitude diagram or in GALEX archival ultraviolet imaging, with
the GALEX data indicating $\log (\mathrm{SFR_{NUV}/M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}) < -5.4$
for star formation on $\lesssim$100 Myr time scales. Given its isolation and
physical properties, Tucana B may be a definitive example of an ultra-faint
dwarf that has been quenched by reionization, providing strong confirmation of
a key driver of galaxy formation and evolution at the lowest mass scales. It
also signals a new era of ultra-faint dwarf galaxy discovery at the extreme
edges of the Local Group.

Title:Optical emission-line Luminosity Function models for populations of Supernova Remnants,"
Abstract:  We present a basic model for the calculation of the luminosity distribution

- Ha luminosity functions for supernova remnants by combining prescriptions
from a basic evolution model that provides the shock velocity and radius for
SNRs of different age and pre-shock density, with shock excitation models that
give the gas emissivity for shocks of different physical parameters. We assume
a flat age distribution, and we explore the effect of different pre-shock
density distributions or different magnetic parameters. We find very good
agreement between the shape of the model Ha and the joint [S II] - Ha
luminosity functions and those measured from SNR surveys in nearby galaxies.

Title:Disks in Nearby Young Stellar Associations Found Via Virtual Reality,"
Abstract:  The Disk Detective citizen science project recently released a new catalog of
disk candidates found by visual inspection of images from NASA's Wide-Field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission and other surveys. We applied this new
catalog of well-vetted disk candidates to search for new members of nearby
young stellar associations (YSAs) using a novel technique based on Gaia data
and virtual reality (VR). We examined AB Doradus, Argus, $\beta$ Pictoris,
Carina, Columba, Octans-Near, Tucana-Horologium, and TW Hya by displaying them
in VR together with other nearby stars, color-coded to show infrared excesses
found via Disk Detective. Using this method allows us to find new association
members in mass regimes where isochrones are degenerate. We propose ten new YSA
members with infrared excesses: three of AB Doradus (HD 44775, HD 40540 and HD
44510), one of $\beta$ Pictoris (HD 198472), two of Octans-Near (HD 157165 and
BD+35 2953), and four disk-hosting members of a combined population of Carina,
Columba and Tucana-Horologium: CPD-57 937, HD 274311, HD 41992, and WISEA
J092521.90-673224.8. This last object (J0925) appears to be an extreme debris
disk with a fractional infrared luminosity of $3.7 \times 10^{-2}$. We also
propose two new members of AB Doradus that do not show infrared excesses: TYC
6518-1857-1 and CPD-25 1292. We find HD 15115 appears to be a member of
Tucana-Horologium rather than $\beta$ Pictoris. We advocate for membership in
Columba-Carina of HD 30447, CPD-35 525, and HD 35841. Finally, we propose that
three M dwarfs, previously considered members of Tuc-Hor are better considered
a separate association, tentatively called ``Smethells 165''.

Title:The role of physical and numerical viscosity in hydrodynamical instabilities,"
Abstract:  The evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) is widely used to
assess the performance of numerical methods. We employ this instability to test
both the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and the meshless finite mass
(MFM) implementation in OpenGadget3. We quantify the accuracy of SPH and MFM in
reproducing the linear growth of the KHI with different numerical and physical
set-ups. Among them, we consider: $i)$ numerical induced viscosity, and $ii)$
physically motivated, Braginskii viscosity, and compare their effect on the
growth of the KHI. We find that the changes of the inferred numerical viscosity
when varying nuisance parameters such as the set-up or the number of neighbours
in our SPH code are comparable to the differences obtained when using different
hydrodynamical solvers, i.e. MFM. SPH reproduces the expected reduction of the
growth rate in the presence of physical viscosity and recovers well the
threshold level of physical viscosity needed to fully suppress the instability.
In the case of galaxy clusters with a virial temperature of $3\times10^7$ K,
this level corresponds to a suppression factor of $\approx10^{-3}$ of the
classical Braginskii value. The intrinsic, numerical viscosity of our SPH
implementation in such an environment is inferred to be at least an order of
magnitude smaller (i.e. $\approx10^ {-4}$), re-ensuring that modern SPH methods
are suitable to study the effect of physical viscosity in galaxy clusters.

Title:CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy. II. Methanol formation at low metallicity,"
Abstract:  The outer Galaxy is an environment with metallicity lower than the Solar one
and, because of this, the formation and survival of molecules in star-forming
regions located in the inner and outer Galaxy is expected to be different. To
gain understanding on how chemistry changes throughout the Milky Way, it is
crucial to observe outer Galaxy star-forming regions to constrain models
adapted for lower metallicity environments. The project ""chemical complexity in
star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy"" (CHEMOUT) aims to address this
problem observing a sample of 35 high-mass star-forming cores at Galactocentric
distances up to ~23 kpc with the IRAM 30m telescope in various 3mm and 2mm
bands. In this work we analyse observations of methanol (CH3OH), one of the
simplest complex organic molecules crucial for organic chemistry in
star-forming regions, and of two chemically related species, HCO and
formaldehyde (H2CO), towards 15 out of the 35 targets of the CHEMOUT sample. In
fact, only targets previously detected in both HCO and H2CO, both precursors of
methanol, were considered. We detected CH3OH in all 15 targets. Using a Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium approach, we derive CH3OH excitation temperatures in
the range 7 - 16 K and line widths smaller than 4 km/s, consistent with
emission from a cold and quiescent envelope. The CH3OH fractional abundances
w.r.t. H2 range between ~0.6 x 10^{-9} and ~7.4 x 10^{-9}. These values are
comparable to those found in star-forming regions in the inner and local
Galaxy. Our results have important implications in the organic, and possibly
pre-biotic, chemistry occurring in the outermost star-forming regions of the
Galaxy, and can help setting the frontiers of the Galactic habitable zone.

Title:SRGA J181414.6-225604: A new Galactic symbiotic X-ray binary outburst triggered by an intense mass loss episode of a heavily obscured Mira variable,"
Abstract:  We present the discovery and multi-wavelength characterization of SRGA
J181414.6-225604, a Galactic hard X-ray transient discovered during the ongoing
SRG/ART-XC sky survey. Using data from the Palomar Gattini-IR survey, we
identify a spatially and temporally coincident variable infrared (IR) source,
IRAS 18111-2257, and classify it as a very late-type (M7-M8), long period
($1502 \pm 24$ days) and luminous ($M_K\approx -9.9 \pm 0.2$) O-rich Mira donor
star located at a distance of $\approx 14.6^{+2.9}_{-2.3}$ kpc. Combining
multi-color photometric data over the last $\approx 25$ years, we show that the
IR counterpart underwent a recent (starting $\approx 800$ days before the X-ray
flare) enhanced mass loss (reaching $\approx 2.1 \times 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$) episode resulting in an expanding dust shell obscuring the
underlying star. Multi-epoch follow-up from Swift, NICER and NuSTAR reveal a
$\approx 200$ day long X-ray outburst reaching a peak luminosity of $L_X
\approx 2.5 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, characterized by a heavily absorbed
($N_{\rm H} \approx 6\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) X-ray spectrum consistent with
an optically thick Comptonized plasma. The X-ray spectral and timing behavior
suggest the presence of clumpy wind accretion together with a dense ionized
nebula overabundant in silicate material surrounding the compact object.
Together, we show that SRGA J181414.6-225604 is a new symbiotic X-ray binary in
outburst, triggered by an intense dust formation episode of a highly evolved
donor. Our results offer the first direct confirmation for the speculated
connection between enhanced late-stage donor mass loss and active lifetimes of
the symbiotic X-ray binaries.

"Title:Multi-messenger constraints on the Hubble constant through combination of gravitational waves, gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae from neutron star mergers","
Abstract:  The simultaneous detection of gravitational waves and light from the binary
neutron star merger GW170817 led to independent measurements of distance and
redshift, providing a direct estimate of the Hubble constant $H_0$ that does
not rely on a cosmic distance ladder nor assumes a specific cosmological model.
By using gravitational waves as ''standard sirens'', this approach holds
promise to arbitrate the existing tension between the $H_0$ value inferred from
the cosmic microwave background and those obtained from local measurements.
However, the known degeneracy in the gravitational-wave analysis between
distance and inclination of the source lead to a $H_0$ value from GW170817 that
was not precise enough to resolve the existing tension. In this review, we
summarize recent works exploiting the viewing-angle dependence of the
electromagnetic signal, namely the associated short gamma-ray burst and
kilonova, to constrain the system inclination and improve on $H_0$. We outline
the key ingredients of the different methods, summarize the results obtained in
the aftermath of GW170817 and discuss the possible systematics introduced by
each of these methods.

Abstract:  We here present the results from a detailed analysis of nebular abundances of
commonly observed ions in the collisional ring galaxy Cartwheel using the Very
Large Telescope (VLT) Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) dataset. The
analysis includes 221 HII regions in the star-forming ring, in addition to 40
relatively fainter H$\alpha$ emitting regions in the spokes, disk and the inner
ring. The ionic abundances of He, N, O and Fe are obtained using the direct
method (DM) for 9, 20, 20, and 17 ring HII regions, respectively, where the
S$^{++}$ temperature-sensitive line is detected. For the rest of the regions,
including all the nebulae between the inner and the outer ring, we obtained O
abundances using the strong-line method (SLM). The ring regions have a median
$12+\log\rm{\frac{O}{H}}$=8.19$\pm$0.15, $\log\rm{\frac{N}{O}}=-$1.57$\pm$0.09
and $\log\rm{\frac{Fe}{O}}=-$2.24$\pm$0.09 using the DM. Within the range of O
abundances seen in the Cartwheel, the N/O and Fe/O values decrease
proportionately with increasing O, suggesting local enrichment of O without
corresponding enrichment of primary N and Fe. The O abundances of the disk HII
regions obtained using the SLM show a well-defined radial gradient. The mean O
abundance of the ring HII regions is lower by $\sim$0.1 dex as compared to the
extrapolation of the radial gradient. The observed trends suggest the
preservation of the pre-collisional abundance gradient, displacement of most of
the processed elements to the ring, as predicted by the recent simulation by
Renaud et al. (2018), and post-collisional infall of metal-poor gas in the
ring.

variable star V533 Her. We detect a periodicity consistent with the binary
orbital period and estimate a revised value of 3.53709(2) hr. We also detect a
strong signal near a period of 3.8 h that we associate with positive
superhumps. The superhump frequency varies over the TESS observations with the
fractional difference between the superhump and orbital periods, $\epsilon$,
ranging between $0.055\le \epsilon \le 0.080$. The superhump amplitude is
correlated with its frequency such that the amplitude increases as $\epsilon$
decreases. Positive superhumps result from an instability that generates an
eccentric accretion disk and $\epsilon$ is a measure of the disk precession
rate in the binary rest frame. The observed correlation implies that as the
disk precession rate slows, the disk eccentricity increases.

Title:Feedback effect on the observable properties of $z>6$ AGN,"
Abstract:  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has a major impact onto the
supermassive black-hole (SMBH) growth, the properties of the host galaxies, and
their cosmic evolution. We investigate the effects of different kinetic
feedback prescriptions on the observable properties of AGN and their host
galaxies at $z>6$ in a suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations. We find that
kinetic feedback decreases the column density of the interstellar medium (ISM)
in the host galaxy by up to a factor of $\approx10$, especially when the SMBHs
reach high accretion rates ($\approx10-30\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$). In
particular, kinetic feedback is required to extend the ISM size to $>1$ kpc and
match the observed sizes of the gas reservoirs in $z>6$ AGN host galaxies.
Moreover, it produces unobscured lines of sight along which the AGN can be
detected in the rest-frame UV band with magnitudes consistent with observed
values of $z>6$ AGN. The assumed geometry of the outflow plays an important
role in shaping the observed properties of high-redshift AGN. We find that a
biconical geometry is favored over a spherical one to reproduce the observed
properties, but it overestimates the number of multiple AGN systems detectable
in X-ray observations. This result suggests that simplistic BH seeding recipes
widely employed in cosmological simulations produce too many X-ray detectable
multiple AGN at $z=6-7$, thus soliciting the adoption of more physically
motivated seeding prescriptions.

Title:Accretion onto a binary from a polar circumbinary disc,"
Abstract:  We present hydrodynamical simulations to model the accretion flow from a
polar circumbinary disc onto a high eccentricity ($e=0.78$) binary star system
with near unity mass ratio ($q=0.83$), as a model for binary HD 98800 BaBb. We
compare the polar circumbinary disc accretion flow with the previously studied
coplanar case. In the coplanar case, the circumbinary disc becomes eccentric
and the accretion alternates from being dominant onto one binary member to the
other. For the polar disc case involving a highly eccentric binary, we find
that the circumbinary disc retains its initially low eccentricity and that the
primary star accretion rate is always about the same as the secondary star
accretion rate. Recent observations of the binary HD 98800 BaBb, which has a
polar circumbinary disc, have been used to determine the value of the $\rm
H\alpha$ flux from the brighter component. From this value, we infer that the
accretion rate is much lower than for typical T Tauri stars. The eccentric
orbit of the outer companion HD 98800 A increases the accretion rate onto HD
98800 B by $\sim 20$ per cent after each periastron passage. Our hydrodynamical
simulations are unable to explain such a low accretion rate unless the disc
viscosity parameter is very small, $\alpha < 10^{-5}$. Additional observations
of this system would be useful to check on this low accretion rate.

Abstract:  Ionized gas probes the influence of massive stars on their environment. The

in our Galaxy, in which the Cyg OB2 association (age of 3-5 Myr and stellar
mass $2 \times 10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$) has a dominant influence. We observe the
Cygnus X region at 148 MHz using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and take into
account short-spacing information during image deconvolution. Together with
data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, we investigate the morphology,
distribution, and physical conditions of low-density ionized gas in a
$4^{\circ} \times 4^{\circ}$ (100 pc $\times$ 100 pc) region at a resolution of
2' (0.9 pc). The Galactic radio emission in the region analyzed is almost
entirely thermal (free-free) at 148 MHz, with emission measures of $10^3 <
EM~{\rm[pc~cm^{-6}]} < 10^6$. As filamentary structure is a prominent feature
of the emission, we use DisPerSE and FilChap to identify filamentary ridges and
characterize their radial ($EM$) profiles. The distribution of radial profiles
has a characteristic width of 4.3 pc and a power-law distribution ($\beta =
-1.8 \pm 0.1$) in peak $EM$ down to our completeness limit of 4200 pc
cm$^{-6}$. The electron densities of the filamentary structure range from $10 <
n_e~{\rm[cm^{-3}]} < 400$ with a median value of 35 cm$^{-3}$, remarkably
similar to [N II] surveys of ionized gas. Cyg OB2 may ionize at most two-thirds
of the total ionized gas and the ionized gas in filaments. More than half of
the filamentary structures are likely photoevaporating surfaces flowing into a
surrounding diffuse (~5 cm$^{-3}$) medium. However, this is likely not the case
for all ionized gas ridges. A characteristic width in the distribution of
ionized gas points to the stellar winds of Cyg OB2 creating a fraction of the
ionized filaments through swept-up ionized gas or dissipated turbulence.

Title:Simulating Transient Noise Bursts in LIGO with gengli,"
Abstract:  In the field of gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers, the most severe
limitation to the detection of GW signals from astrophysical sources comes from
random noise, which reduces the instrument sensitivity and impacts the data
quality. For transient searches, the most problematic are transient noise
artifacts, known as glitches, happening at a rate around $1 \text{min}^{-1}$.
As they can mimic GW signals, there is a need for better modeling and inclusion
of glitches in large-scale studies, such as stress testing the searches
pipelines and increasing confidence of a detection. In this work, we employ
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to learn the underlying distribution of
blip glitches and to generate artificial populations. Taking inspiration from
the field of image processing, we implement Wasserstein GAN with consistency
term penalty for the generation of glitches in time domain. Furthermore, we
share the trained weights through the \texttt{gengli}, a user-friendly
open-source software package for fast glitch generation and provide practical
examples about its usage.

Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping

variations in the Faraday rotation measure (RM) of FRB 20180916B. Over the nine
month period 2021 April$-$2021 December we observe an apparent secular increase
in $\rm{RM}$ of $\sim 50 \; \rm{rad\, m^{-2}}$ (a fractional change of over
$40\%$) that is accompanied by a possible drift of the emitting band to lower
frequencies. This interval displays very little variation in the dispersion
measure ($\Delta \rm{DM}\lesssim 0.8\; \rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$) which indicates that
the observed RM evolution is likely produced from coherent changes in the
Faraday-active medium's magnetic field. Burst-to-burst RM variations appear
unrelated to the activity cycle phase. The degree of linear polarization of our
burst sample ($\gtrsim 80\%$) is consistent with the negligible depolarization
expected for this source in the 400-800 MHz bandpass of CHIME. FRB 20180916B
joins other repeating FRBs in displaying substantial RM variations between
bursts. This is consistent with the notion that repeater progenitors may be
associated with young stellar populations by their preferential occupation of
dynamic magnetized environments commonly found in supernova remnants, pulsar
wind nebulae or near high mass stellar companions.

relatively stationary, while another is evolving with time, which is confirmed
by the difference analysis at different populations and supporting that there
might be two kinds of dynamical origins with possible coupling mechanisms.
Furthermore, ridge features are also vividly present in the chemical properties
([Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe]), in particular for the mass distribution (M). The
comparison between the north and south hemispheres of the Galaxy does not show
a clear asymmetry in the phase space location even though the amplitude (e.g.,
vertical velocity) is asymmetrical. Moreover, we find that diagonal ridge
structures may affect the shape of the rotation curve, which is manifested as
fluctuations and undulations on top of a smooth profile.

Title:Extreme solar events,"
Abstract:  We trace the evolution of research on extreme solar and solar-terrestrial
events from the 1859 Carrington event to the rapid development of the last
twenty years. Our focus is on the largest observed/inferred/theoretical cases
of sunspot groups, flares on the Sun and Sun-like stars, coronal mass
ejections, solar proton events, and geomagnetic storms. The reviewed studies
are based on modern observations, historical or long-term data including the
auroral and cosmogenic radionuclide record, and Kepler observations of Sun-like
stars. We compile a table of 100- and 1000-year events based on occurrence
frequency distributions for the space weather phenomena listed above. Questions
considered include the Sun-like nature of superflare stars and the existence of
impactful but unpredictable solar ""black swans"" and extreme ""dragon king"" solar
phenomena that can involve different physics from that operating in events
which are merely large.

Title:Using Machine Learning to Identify Extragalactic Globular Cluster Candidates from Ground-Based Photometric Surveys of M87,"
Abstract:  Globular clusters (GCs) have been at the heart of many longstanding questions
in many sub-fields of astronomy and, as such, systematic identification of GCs
in external galaxies has immense impacts. In this study, we take advantage of
M87's well-studied GC system to implement supervised machine learning (ML)
classification algorithms - specifically random forest and neural networks - to
identify GCs from foreground stars and background galaxies using ground-based
photometry from the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope (CFHT). We compare these
two ML classification methods to studies of ""human-selected"" GCs and find that
the best performing random forest model can reselect 61.2% $\pm$ 8.0% of GCs
selected from HST data (ACSVCS) and the best performing neural network model
reselects 95.0% $\pm$ 3.4%. When compared to human-classified GCs and
contaminants selected from CFHT data - independent of our training data - the
best performing random forest model can correctly classify 91.0% $\pm$ 1.2% and
the best performing neural network model can correctly classify 57.3% $\pm$
1.1%. ML methods in astronomy have been receiving much interest as Vera C.
Rubin Observatory prepares for first light. The observables in this study are
selected to be directly comparable to early Rubin Observatory data and the
prospects for running ML algorithms on the upcoming dataset yields promising
results.

Title:Study on the magnetic field strength of NGC 300 ULX1,"
Abstract:  NGC 300 ULX1 is a pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source (PULX) with the
longest spin period of $P\simeq31.6\,\rm s$ and a high spin-up rate of $\dot
P\simeq5.56\times10^{-7}\,\rm s\,s^{-1}$ that is ever seen in the confirmed
PULXs. In this paper, the inferred magnetic field of NGC 300 ULX1 is
$\sim3.0\times10^{14}\,\rm G$ using the recent observed parameters after its
first detection of pulsations. According to the evolved simulation of the
magnetic field and the spin period, it will become a recycled pulsar or a
millisecond pulsar under the conditions of the companion mass and the accretion
rate limitation. We suggest that NGC 300 ULX1 is an accreting magnetar
accounting for its super Eddington luminosity. We also propose that there might
be other accreting magnetars in the confirmed PULXs. Such PULXs will be helpful
for understanding the magnetar evolution and the millisecond pulsar formation
whose magnetic field is stronger than $\sim10^{9}\,\rm G$.

Title:A general stability-driven approach for the refinement of multi-planet systems,"
Abstract:  Over the past years, the amount of detected multi-planet systems
significantly grew, an important sub-class of which being the compact
configurations. A precise knowledge of them is crucial to understand the
conditions with which planetary systems form and evolve. However, observations
often leave these systems with large uncertainties, notably on the orbital
eccentricities. This is especially prominent for systems with low-mass planets
detected with Radial Velocities (RV), the amount of which is more and more
important in the exoplanet population. It is becoming a common approach to
refine these parameters with the help of orbital stability arguments.
Such dynamical techniques can be computationally expensive. In this work we
use an alternative procedure faster by orders of magnitude than classical
N-body integration approaches.
We couple a reliable exploration of the parameter space with the precision of
the Numerical Analysis of Fundamental Frequencies (NAFF, Laskar 1990) fast
chaos indicator. We also propose a general procedure to calibrate the NAFF
indicator on any multi-planet system without additional computational cost.
This calibration strategy is illustrated on HD 45364, in addition to
yet-unpublished measurements obtained with the HARPS and CORALIE
high-resolution spectrographs. We validate the calibration approach on HD
202696. We test the performances of this stability-driven approach on two
systems with different architectures. First we study HD 37124, a 3-planet
system composed of planets in the Jovian regime. Then, we analyse HD 215152, a
compact system of four low-mass planets.
We demonstrate the potential of the NAFF stability-driven approach to refine
the orbital parameters and planetary masses. We stress the importance of
undertaking systematic global dynamical analyses on every new multi-planet
system discovered.

Title:A dynamical definition of the sphere of influence of the Earth,"
Abstract:  The concept of sphere of influence of a planet is useful in both the context
of impact monitoring of asteroids with the Earth and of the design of
interplanetary trajectories for spacecrafts. After reviewing the classical
results, we propose a new definition for this sphere that depends on the
position and velocity of the small body for given values of the Jacobi constant
$C$. Here we compare the orbit of the small body obtained in the framework of
the circular restricted three-body problem, with orbits obtained by patching
two-body solutions. Our definition is based on an optimisation process,
minimizing a suitable target function with respect to the assumed radius of the
sphere of influence. For different values of $C$ we represent the results in
the planar case: we show the values of the selected radius as a function of two
angles characterising the orbit. In this case, we also produce a database of
radii of the sphere of influence for several initial conditions, allowing an
interpolation.

Title:Unsupervised classification of CIGALE galaxy spectra,"
Abstract:  Aims. The present study aims at providing a deeper insight into the power and
limitation of an unsupervised classification algorithm (called Fisher-EM) on
spectra of galaxies. This algorithm uses a Gaussian mixture in a discriminative
latent subspace. To this end, we investigate the capacity of this algorithm to
segregate the physical parameters used to generate mock spectra and the
influence of the noise on the classification. Methods. With the code CIGALE and
different values for nine input parameters characterising the stellar
population, we have simulated a sample of 11 475 optical spectra of galaxies
containing 496 monochromatic fluxes. The statistical model and the optimum
number of clusters is given in Fisher-EM by the integrated completed likelihood
(ICL) criterion. We repeated the analyses several times to assess the
robustness of the results. Results. Two distinct classifications can be
distinguished in the case of the noiseless spectra. The one above 13 clusters
disappears when noise is added, while the classification with 12 clusters is
very robust against noise down to a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 3. At SNR=1,
the optimum is 5 clusters, but the classification is still compatible with the
previous one. The distribution of the parameters used for the simulation shows
an excellent discrimination between classes. A higher dispersion both in the
spectra within each class and in the parameter distribution, leads us to
conclude that despite a much higher ICL, the classification with more than 13
clusters in the noiseless case is not physically relevant. Conclusions. This
study yields two conclusions valid at least for the Fisher-EM algorithm.
Firstly, the unsupervised classification of spectra of galaxies is both
reliable and robust to noise. Secondly, such analyses are able to extract the
useful physical information contained in the spectra and to build highly
meaningful classifications. In an epoch of data-driven astrophysics, it is
important to trust unsupervised machine learning approaches that do not require
training samples which are unavoidably biased.

"Title:One pulsar, two white dwarfs, and a planet confirming the strong equivalence principle","
Abstract:  The strong equivalence principle is a cornerstone of general relativity,
tested with exquisite accuracy in the Solar system. However, tests in the
strong-field regime require a compact object. Currently, PSR J0337+1715 is the
unique millisecond pulsar found in a triple stellar system, orbiting two white
dwarfs within an area comparable to the orbit of the Earth. This configuration
offers the opportunity for a dramatic improvement over previous tests, provided
that accurate and regular timing of the pulsar can be achieved. This also
requires the development of a new timing model solving numerically the
relativistic three-body problem with great accuracy. We report on the analysis
of the high-quality dataset gathered on PSR J0337+1715 by the Nan{\c c}ay
radiotelescope over the past 8 years. In particular, I will show how we could
obtain the most stringent limit to-date on a potential violation of the strong
equivalent principle in the strong field regime. I will also introduce
preliminary resuts showing that the presence of a small planet in the system
may explain a tiny residual signal so far unaccounted for, which if confirmed
would make this system exceptionally rich.

Title:Cosmological Constraints on the Global Star Formation Law of Galaxies: Insights From Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Intensity Mapping,"
Abstract:  Originally proposed as a cosmological probe of the large-scale structure,
line intensity mapping (LIM) also offers a unique window into the astrophysics
of galaxy evolution. Adding to the astrophysical explorations of LIM technique
that have traditionally focused on small, non-linear scales, we present a novel
method to study the global star formation law using forthcoming data from
large-scale baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) intensity mapping. Using the
amplitude of the percent-level but scale-dependent bias induced by baryon
fraction fluctuations on BAO scales, we show that combining auto- and
cross-correlation power spectra of two (or more) LIM signals allows to probe
the star formation law power index $\mathcal{N}$. We examine the prospect for
mapping H$\alpha$ and [OIII] lines across all scales, especially where imprints
of the baryon fraction deviation exist, with space missions like SPHEREx. We
show that although SPHEREx may only marginally probe $\mathcal{N}$ by accessing
a modest number of large-scale modes in its 200 deg$^2$ deep survey, future
infrared all-sky surveys reaching a comparable depth with an improved spectral
resolution ($R \gtrsim 400$) are likely to constrain $\mathcal{N}$ to a
precision of 10$-$30%, sufficient for distinguishing models with varying
feedback assumptions, out to $z\sim4$ using BAO intensity mapping. Leveraging
this effect, large, cosmic-variance-limited LIM surveys in the far future can
scrutinize the physical connection between galaxy evolution and the large-scale
cosmological environment, while performing stringent tests of the standard
cosmological model.

"Title:A CHEOPS Search for Massive, Long-Period Companions to the Warm Jupiter K2-139 b","
Abstract:  K2-139 b is a warm Jupiter with an orbital period of 28.4 d, but only three
transits of this system have previously been observed, in the long-cadence mode
of K2, limiting the precision with which the orbital period can be determined,
and future transits predicted. We report photometric observations of four
transits of K2-139 b with ESA's CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS),
conducted with the goal of measuring the orbital obliquity via spot-crossing
events. We jointly fit these CHEOPS data alongside the three
previously-published transits from the K2 mission, considerably increasing the
precision of the ephemeris of K2-139 b. The transit times for this system can
now be predicted for the next decade with a $1 \sigma$ precision less than 10
minutes, compared to over one hour previously, allowing the efficient
scheduling of observations with Ariel. We detect no significant deviation from
a linear ephemeris, allowing us to exclude the presence of a massive outer
planet orbiting with a period less than 150 d, or a brown dwarf with a period
less than one year. We also determine the scaled semi-major axis, the impact
parameter, and the stellar limb-darkening with improved precision. This is
driven by the shorter cadence of the CHEOPS observations compared to that of
K2, and validates the sub-exposure technique used for analysing long-cadence
photometry. Finally, we note that the stellar spot configuration has changed
from the epoch of the K2 observations; unlike the K2 transits, we detect no
evidence of spot-crossing events in the CHEOPS data.

Title:Ryugu's observed volatile loss did not arise from impact heating alone,"
Abstract:  Carbonaceous asteroids, including Ryugu and Bennu, which have been explored
by the Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx missions, were probably important carriers of
volatiles to the inner Solar System. However, Ryugu has experienced significant
volatile loss, possibly from hypervelocity impact heating. Here we present
impact experiments at speeds comparable to those expected in the main asteroid
belt (3.7 km s-1 and 5.8 km s-1) and with analogue target materials. We find
that loss of volatiles from the target material due to impacts is not
sufficient to account for the observed volatile depletion of Ryugu. We propose
that mutual collisions in the main asteroid belt are unlikely to be solely
responsible for the loss of volatiles from Ryugu or its parent body. Instead,
we suggest that additional processes, for example associated with the diversity
in mechanisms and timing of their formation, are necessary to account for the
variable volatile contents of carbonaceous asteroids.

Title:Mapping the kinematic parameters of the Galaxy from the Gaia EDR3 red giants and sub-giants,"
Abstract:  We present the results of a kinematic analysis of red giants and subgiants
whose centroids are in the plane of our Galaxy. For this, the positions,
parallaxes, proper motions, and radial velocities of these stars from the
$Gaia$ EDR3 catalog were used. We applied two approaches to obtain kinematic
parameters. The first approach -- solving the equations of the
Ogorodnikov--Milne model with respect to 12 kinematic parameters -- is
generally accepted, but has a number of disadvantages. The second approach
developed by us is to find the components of galactocentric centroid's velocity
and their partial derivatives with respect to coordinates directly from
differential equations for the stellar velocity field. To calculate the
kinematic parameters by the methods mentioned above, same stellar samples were
used. From these samples spherical regions with a radius of 1 kpc were
selected, the centers of which were located strictly in the Galactic mid-plane
at the nodes of the coordinate grid ($x_{gal}$, $y_{gal}$) of a rectangular
Galactocentric coordinate system with step 100 pc. The region of the Galaxy
under study occupies the coordinate interval $115^\circ < \theta < 245^\circ$,
0 kpc$ < R < $16 kpc, -1 kpc$ < z < $1 kpc. We show the behavior of local
kinematic parameters as well as global parameters such as the circular velocity
of stars as a function of galactocentric coordinates. For the first time, the
components of centroids' spatial velocities and all their partial derivatives
as well as their behavior as a function of galactic coordinates have been
derived. The behavior of the $\partial V_R/\partial \theta$ and $\partial
V_\theta/\partial \theta$ parameters as a function of galactic coordinates has

Title:Shock recovery with decaying compressive pulses: Shock effects in calcite (CaCO$_3$) around the Hugoniot elastic limit,"
Abstract:  Shock metamorphism of minerals in meteorites provides insights into the
ancient Solar System. Calcite is an abundant aqueous alteration mineral in
carbonaceous chondrites. Return samples from the asteroids Ryugu and Bennu are
expected to contain calcite-group minerals. Although shock metamorphism in
silicates has been well studied, such data for aqueous alteration minerals are
limited. Here, we investigated the shock effects in calcite with marble using
impact experiments at the Planetary Exploration Research Center of Chiba
Institute of Technology. We produced decaying compressive pulses with a smaller
projectile than the target. A metal container facilitates recovery of a sample
that retains its pre-impact stratigraphy. We estimated the peak pressure
distributions in the samples with the iSALE shock physics code. The capability
of this method to produce shocked grains that have experienced different
degrees of metamorphism from a single experiment is an advantage over
conventional uniaxial shock recovery experiments. The shocked samples were
investigated by polarizing microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. We found
that more than half of calcite grains exhibit undulatory extinction when peak
pressure exceeds 3 GPa. This shock pressure is one order of magnitude higher
than the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) of marble, but it is close to the HEL of
a calcite crystal, suggesting that the undulatory extinction records
dislocation-induced plastic deformation in the crystal. Finally, we propose a
strategy to re-construct the maximum depth of calcite grains in a meteorite
parent body, if shocked calcite grains are identified in chondrites and/or
return samples from Ryugu and Bennu.

Title:Pandora: A fast open-source exomoon transit detection algorithm,"
Abstract:  We present Pandora, a new software to model, detect, and characterize

Pandora uses an analytical description of the transit light curve for both the
planet and the moon in front of a star with atmospheric limb darkening and it
covers all cases of mutual planet-moon eclipses during transit. The orbital
motion of the star-planet-moon system is computed with a high accuracy as a
nested Keplerian problem. We have optimized Pandora for computational speed to
make it suitable for large-scale exomoon searches in the new era of space-based
high-accuracy surveys. We demonstrate the usability of Pandora for exomoon
searches by first simulating a light curve with four transits of a hypothetical
Jupiter with a giant Neptune-sized exomoon in a one-year orbit around a
Sun-like star. The 10 min cadence of the data matches that of the upcoming
PLATO mission and the noise of 100 parts per million is dominated by photon
noise, assuming a photometrically quiet, $m_V = 11$ Sun-like star for
practicality. We recovered the simulated system parameters with the UltraNest
Bayesian inference package. The run-time of this search is about five hours on
a standard computer. Pandora is the first photodynamical open-source exomoon
transit detection algorithm, implemented fully in the Python programming
language and available for the community to join the search for exomoons.

Title:NIR spectroscopic survey of protostellar jets in the star forming region IC 1396N,"
Abstract:  Abridged. The bright-rimmed cloud IC1396N hosts CO, H$_2$, and Herbig-Haro
outflows powered by millimetre compact sources. We aim to characterise the
kinematics and physical conditions of the H$_2$ emission features spread over
IC1396N, which appear as chains of knots with a jet-like morphology, tracing
different H$_2$ outflows, and to obtain further information about (and an
identification of) the driving sources. Low-resolution, long-slit near-infrared
spectra were acquired with NICS at the TNG, using grisms KB (R~1200), HK and JH
(R~500). Several slit pointings and PA were used throughout IC1396N to sample a
number of the H$_2$ knots previously detected in deep H$_2$ 2.12 $\mu$m images.
The knots exhibit rich ro-vibrational spectra of H$_2$, consistent with
shock-excited excitation, from which radial velocities and relevant physical
conditions of the IC1396N H$_2$ outflows were derived. These also allowed
estimating extinction ranges towards several features. [FeII] emission was only
detected towards a few knots, which also display unusually large H$_2$ 1-0
S(3)/S(1) flux ratios. The obtained radial velocities confirm that most of the
outflows are close to the plane of the sky. Nearby knots in the same chain
often display different radial velocities, both blue-shifted and red-shifted,
which we interpret as due to ubiquitous jet precession in the driving sources
or the development of oblique shocks. One of the chains (strand A) appears as a
set of features trailing a leading bow-shock structure consistent with the
results of 3-D magneto-hydrodynamical models. Either side of the leading
bow-shock (A15) exhibits a different radial velocity, whose possible
explanations are discussed in the paper. Our data cannot confirm whether
strands A and B have both been originated by the intermediate mass young
stellar object BIMA 2.

Abstract:  Black hole-like objects with mass greater than $10 M_{\odot}$, as discovered
by gravitational antennas, can produce long time-scale (several years)
gravitational microlensing effects. Considered separately, previous
microlensing surveys were insensitive to such events because of their limited
duration of 6-7 years. We combined light curves from the EROS-2 and MACHO
surveys to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to create a joint database for 14.1

through 4 wide passbands. We searched for multi-year microlensing events in
this catalog of extended light curves, complemented by 24.1 million light
curves observed by only one of the surveys. Our analysis, combined with
previous analysis from EROS, shows that compact objects with mass between
$10^{-7}$ and $200 M_{\odot}$ can not constitute more than $\sim 20\%$ of the
total mass of a standard halo (at $95\%$ CL). We also exclude that $\sim 50\%$
of the halo is made of Black Holes (BH) lighter than $1000 M_{\odot}$.

Title:A WHIM origin for the soft excess emission in the Coma cluster,"
Abstract:  This paper provides a new analysis of ROSAT observations of the Coma cluster,
to determine the amount of soft X--ray radiation in excess of the contribution
from the hot intra--cluster medium. The re--analysis is made possible by a
high--resolution study of the hot intra--cluster medium with the XMM-Newton and
Planck telescopes out to the cluster's virial radius. The analysis confirms the
original findings of a strong excess of soft X--ray radiation, which is likely
to be of thermal origin. We find quantitative agreement between the detected
soft excess and the physical characteristics of warm--hot intergalactic medium
(WHIM) filaments seen in hydrodynamical simulations. We conclude that the most
plausible explanation for the soft excess is the presence of $\sim
10$~Mpc--long filaments at $\log T(K)\simeq 6$, with a baryon overdensity $\sim
300$, converging towards the Coma cluster. This interpretation therefore
provides support for the identification of the missing low--redshift baryons
with WHIM filaments, as predicted by numerical simulations.

Title:Astroparticle Constraints from Cosmic Reionization and Primordial Galaxy Formation,"
Abstract:  We derive astroparticle constraints in different dark matter scenarios
alternative to cold dark matter (CDM): thermal relic warm dark matter, WDM;
fuzzy dark matter, $\psi$DM; self-interacting dark matter, SIDM; sterile
neutrino dark matter, $\nu$DM. Our framework is based on updated determinations
of the high-redshift UV luminosity functions for primordial galaxies out to
redshift $z\sim 10$, on redshift-dependent halo mass functions in the above DM
scenarios from numerical simulations, and on robust constraints on the
reionization history of the Universe from recent astrophysical and cosmological
datasets. First, we build up an empirical model of cosmic reionization
characterized by two parameters, namely the escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}$ of
ionizing photons from primordial galaxies, and the limiting UV magnitude
$M_{\rm UV}^{\rm lim}$ down to which the extrapolated UV luminosity functions
are steeply increasing. Second, we perform standard abundance matching of the
UV luminosity function and the halo mass function, obtaining a relationship
between UV luminosity and halo mass whose shape depends on an astroparticle
quantity $X$ specific of each DM scenario (e.g., WDM particle mass); we exploit
such a relation to introduce in the analysis a constraint from primordial
galaxy formation, in terms of the threshold halo mass above which primordial
galaxies can efficiently form stars. Third, we implement a sequential updating
Bayesian MCMC technique to perform joint inference on the three parameters
$f_{\rm esc}$, $M_{\rm UV}^{\rm lim}$, $X$, and to compare the outcomes of
different DM scenarios on the reionization history. Finally, we highlight the
relevance of our astroparticle estimates in predicting the behavior of the
high-redshift UV luminosity function at faint, yet unexplored magnitudes, that
may be tested with the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope.

Title:Powering luminous core collapse supernovae with jets,"
Abstract:  I examine recent fittings of luminous supernovae (LSNe) with extra energy
sources of magnetar and helium burning and find that in about half of these
LSNe the fitting parameters have some problems. In some LSNe the total energy
of these two energy sources is larger than the kinetic energy of the ejecta
that the fitting yields. In some others LSNe the total energy of the delayed
neutrino explosion mechanism and these two extra sources combined is smaller
than the kinetic energy that the fitting yields. These difficulties suggest
that, like earlier claims that jets power superluminous supernovae (SLSNe),
jets also power the less luminous LSNe. A magnetar might also supply energy.
However, in most cases jets supply more energy than the magnetar, during the
explosion and possibly at late times. I strengthen an earlier claim that jets
launched at magnetar birth cannot be ignored. I explain the trend of maximum
rise time for a given luminosity of hydrogen deficient core collapse supernovae
(CCSNe), in particular LSNe and SLSNe, with a toy model of jets that are active
for a long time after explosion.

Title:High-energy Gamma-rays from Magnetically Arrested Disks in Nearby Radio Galaxies,"
Abstract:  The origins of the GeV gamma-rays from nearby radio galaxies are unknown.
Hadronic emission from magnetically arrested disks (MADs) around central black
holes (BHs) is proposed as a possible scenario. Particles are accelerated in
the MAD by magnetic reconnection and stochastic turbulence acceleration. We
pick out the fifteen brightest radio galaxies in the GeV band from the Fermi
4LAC-DR2 catalog and apply the MAD model. We find that we can explain the data
in the GeV bands by the MAD model if the accretion rate is lower than 0.1% of
the Eddington rate. For a higher accretion rate, GeV gamma-rays are absorbed by
two-photon interaction due to copious low-energy photons. If we assume another
proposed prescription of the electron heating rate by magnetic reconnection,
the MAD model fails to reproduce the GeV data for the majority of our sample.
This indicates that the electron heating rate is crucial. We also apply the MAD
model to Sgr A* and find that GeV gamma-rays observed at the Galactic center do
not come from the MAD of Sgr A*. We estimate the cosmic ray intensity from Sgr
A*, but it is too low to explain the high-energy cosmic ray intensity on Earth.

Abstract:  Studies on small-scale jets' formation, propagation, evolution, and role,
such as type I and II spicules, mottles, and fibrils in the lower solar

combination of detailed observations and sophisticated mathematical modelling.
This review provides a survey of the current understanding of jets, their
formation in the solar lower atmosphere, and their evolution from
observational, numerical, and theoretical perspectives. First, we review some
results to describe the jet properties, acquired numerically, analytically and
through high-spatial and temporal resolution observations. Further on, we
discuss the role of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, namely
Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, in jet evolution and their
role in the energy transport through the solar atmosphere in fully and
partially ionised plasmas. Finally, we discuss several mechanisms of
magnetohydrodynamic wave generation, propagation, and energy transport in the
context of small-scale solar jets in detail. This review identifies several

"Title:AU Microscopii in the FUV: Observations in Quiescence, During Flares, and Implications for AU Mic b and c","
Abstract:  High energy X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) radiation from young stars impacts
planetary atmospheric chemistry and mass loss. The active $\sim 22$ Myr M dwarf
AU Mic hosts two exoplanets orbiting interior to its debris disk. Therefore,
this system provides a unique opportunity to quantify the effects of stellar
XUV irradiation on planetary atmospheres as a function of both age and orbital
separation. In this paper we present over 5 hours of Far-UV (FUV) observations
of AU Mic taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS; 1070-1360 Angstrom)
on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We provide an itemization of $120$
emission features in the HST/COS FUV spectrum and quantify the flux
contributions from formation temperatures ranging from $10^4-10^7$ K. We detect
13flares in the FUV white-light curve with energies ranging from $10^{29} -
10^{31}$ ergs. The majority of the energy in each of these flares is released
from the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona. There is a
100$\times$ increase in flux at continuum wavelengths $\lambda < 1100$ Angstrom
in each flare which may be caused by thermal Bremsstrahlung emission. We
calculate that the baseline atmospheric mass-loss rate for AU Mic b is $\sim
10^8$ g s$^{-1}$, although this rate can be as high as $\sim 10^{14}$ g
s$^{-1}$ during flares with $L_\textrm{flare} \simeq 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
Finally, we model the transmission spectra for AU Mic b and c with a new
panchromatic spectrum of AU Mic c and motivate future JWST observations of
these planets.

Title:How long do high-redshift massive black hole seeds remain outliers in black hole vs. host galaxy relations?,"
Abstract:  The existence of $10^9\ {\rm M_\odot}$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
within the first billion years of the universe remains a puzzle in our
conventional understanding of black hole formation and growth. The so-called
direct-collapse scenario suggests that the formation of supermassive stars
(SMSs) can yield the massive seeds of early SMBHs. This scenario leads to an
overly massive BH galaxy (OMBG), whose nuclear black hole's mass is comparable
to or even greater than the surrounding stellar mass: a $10^4-10^6~{\rm
M_\odot}$ seed black hole is born in a dark matter halo with a mass as low as
$10^7-10^8~{\rm M_\odot}$. The black hole to stellar mass ratio is $M_{\rm
bh}/M_* \gg 10^{-3}$, well in excess of the typical values at lower redshift.
We investigate how long these newborn BHs remain outliers in the $M_{\rm
bh}-M_{*}$ relation, by exploring the subsequent evolution of two OMBGs
previously identified in the Renaissance simulations. We find that both OMBGs
have $M_{\rm bh}/M_* > 1$ during their entire life, from their birth at
$z\approx 15$ until they merge with much more massive haloes at $z\approx 8$.
We find that the OMBGs are spatially resolvable from their more massive,
$10^{11}~{\rm M_\odot}$, neighboring haloes until their mergers are complete at
$z\approx 8$. This affords a window for future observations with JWST and
sensitive X-ray telescopes to diagnose the direct-collapse scenario, by
detecting similar OMBGs and establishing their uniquely high black
hole-to-stellar mass ratio.

Title:Probing stellar cores from inversions of frequency separation ratios,"
Abstract:  With the rapid development of asteroseismology thanks to space-based
photometry missions such as CoRoT, Kepler, TESS, and in the future, PLATO, and
the use of inversion techniques, quasi-model-independent constraints on the
stellar properties can be extracted from a given stellar oscillation spectrum.
In this context, inversions based on frequency separation ratios, that are less
sensitive to surface effects, appear as a promising technique to constrain the
properties of stellar convective cores. We developed an inversion based on
frequency separation ratios with the goal of damping the surface effects of the
oscillation frequencies. Using this new inversion, we defined a new indicator
to constrain the boundary mixing properties of convective cores in solar-like
oscillators. We verified our inversion technique by conducting tests in a
controlled environment, where the stellar mass and radius are known exactly,
and conducted an extensive hare and hounds exercise. The inversion is not
affected by surface effects. With the construction of an extensive set of
models, favoured and forbidden regions can be highlighted in the parameter
space. If the ratios are well fitted, the inversion is unsurprisingly not
providing additional information. The indicator coupled with the inversion
based on frequency separation ratios seems promising at probing the properties
of convective cores, especially for F-type stars exhibiting solar-like
oscillations.

Title:Electromagnetic precursor flares from the late inspiral of neutron star binaries,"
Abstract:  The coalescence of two neutron stars is accompanied by the emission of
gravitational waves, and can also feature electromagnetic counterparts powered
by mass ejecta and the formation of a relativistic jet after the merger. Since
neutron stars can feature strong magnetic fields, the non-trivial interaction
of the neutron star magnetospheres might fuel potentially powerful
electromagnetic transients prior to merger. A key process powering those
precursor transients is relativistic reconnection in strong current sheets
formed between the two stars. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of
how the twisting of the common magnetosphere of the binary leads to an emission
of electromagnetic flares, akin to those produced in the solar corona. By means
of relativistic force-free electrodynamics simulations, we clarify the role of
different magnetic field topologies in the process. We conclude that flaring
will always occur for suitable magnetic field alignments, unless one of the
neutron stars has a magnetic field significantly weaker than the other.

Title:Characterising the Apertif primary beam response,"
Abstract:  Context. Phased Array Feeds (PAFs) are multi element receivers in the focal
plane of a telescope that make it possible to form simultaneously multiple
beams on the sky by combining the complex gains of the individual antenna
elements. Recently the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) was upgraded
with PAF receivers and carried out several observing programs including two
imaging surveys and a time domain survey. The Apertif imaging surveys use a
configuration, where 40 partially overlapping compound beams (CBs) are
simultaneously formed on the sky and arranged in an approximately rectangular
shape. Aims. This manuscript aims to characterise the response of the 40
Apertif CBs to create frequency-resolved, I, XX and YY polarization empirical
beam shapes. The measured CB maps can be used for image deconvolution, primary
beam correction and mosaicing of Apertif imaging data. Methods. We use drift
scan measurements to measure the response of each of the 40 CBs of Apertif. We
derive beam maps for all individual beams in I, XX and YY polarisation in 10 or
18 frequency bins over the same bandwidth as the Apertif imaging surveys. We
sample the main lobe of the beams and the side lobes up to a radius of 0.6
degrees from the beam centres. In addition, we derive beam maps for each
individual WSRT dish as well. Results. We present the frequency and time
dependence of the beam shapes and sizes. We compare the compound beam shapes
derived with the drift scan method to beam shapes derived with an independent
method using a Gaussian Process Regression comparison between the Apertif
continuum images and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalogue. We find a good
agreement between the beam shapes derived with the two independent methods.

Title:Fermi-LAT Detection of a GeV Afterglow from a Compact Stellar Merger,"
Abstract:  It is usually thought that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are
associated with massive star core collapse, whereas short-duration GRBs are
associated with mergers of compact stellar binaries. The discovery of a
kilonova associated with a nearby (350 Mpc) long-duration GRB-GRB 211211A,
however, indicates that the progenitor of this long-duration GRB is a compact
object merger. Here we report the Fermi-LAT detection of gamma-ray ($>100 {\rm
\ MeV}$) afterglow emission from GRB 211211A, which lasts $\sim$20,000 s after
the burst, the longest event for conventional short-duration GRBs ever
detected. We suggest that this gamma-ray emission results from afterglow
synchrotron emission. The soft spectrum of GeV emission may arise from a
limited maximum synchrotron energy of only a few hundreds of MeV at
$\sim$20,000 s. The usually long duration of the GeV emission could be due to
the proximity of this GRB and the long deceleration time of the GRB jet that is
expanding in a low-density circumburst medium, consistent with the compact
stellar merger scenario.

Title:GRB Afterglow of the Sub-relativistic Materials with Energy Injection,"
Abstract:  Sub-relativistic materials launched during the merger of binary compact
objects and the core-collapse of massive stars acquire velocity structures when
expanding in a stratified environment. The remnant (either a spinning
magnetized neutron star (NS) or a central black hole) from the compact-object
or core-collapse could additionally inject energy into the afterglow via
spin-down luminosity or/and by accreting fall-back material, producing a
refreshed shock, modifying the dynamics, and leading to rich radiation
signatures at distinct timescales and energy bands with contrasting
intensities. We derive the synchrotron light curves evolving in a stratified
environment when a power-law velocity distribution parametrizes the energy of
the shock, and the remnant continuously injects energy into the blastwave. As
the most relevant case, we describe the latest multi-wavelength afterglow
observations ($\gtrsim 900$ days) of the GW170817/GRB 170817A event via a
synchrotron afterglow model with energy injection of a sub-relativistic
material. The features of the remnant and the synchrotron emission of the
sub-relativistic material are consistent with a spinning magnetized NS and the
faster ""blue"" kilonova afterglow, respectively. Using the multi-band
observations of some short-bursts with evidence of kilonova, we provide
constraints on the expected afterglow emission.

Title:The TESS Grand Unified Hot Jupiter Survey. I. Ten TESS Planets,"
Abstract:  We report the discovery of ten short-period giant planets (TOI-2193A b,
TOI-2207 b, TOI-2236 b, TOI-2421 b, TOI-2567 b, TOI-2570 b, TOI-3331 b,
TOI-3540A b, TOI-3693 b, TOI-4137 b). All of the planets were identified as
planet candidates based on periodic flux dips observed by NASA's Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The signals were confirmed to be from
transiting planets using ground-based time-series photometry, high angular
resolution imaging, and high-resolution spectroscopy coordinated with the TESS
Follow-up Observing Program. The ten newly discovered planets orbit relatively
bright F and G stars ($G < 12.5$,~$T_\mathrm{eff}$ between 4800 and 6200 K).
The planets' orbital periods range from 2 to 10~days, and their masses range
from 0.2 to 2.2 Jupiter masses. TOI-2421 b is notable for being a Saturn-mass
planet and TOI-2567 b for being a ``sub-Saturn'', with masses of $0.322\pm
0.073$ and $0.195\pm 0.030$ Jupiter masses, respectively. In most cases, we
have little information about the orbital eccentricities. Two exceptions are
TOI-2207 b, which has an 8-day period and a detectably eccentric orbit ($e =
0.17\pm0.05$), and TOI-3693 b, a 9-day planet for which we can set an upper
limit of $e < 0.052$. The ten planets described here are the first new planets
resulting from an effort to use TESS data to unify and expand on the work of
previous ground-based transit surveys in order to create a large and
statistically useful sample of hot Jupiters.

Title:Prograde spin-up during gravitational collapse,"
Abstract:  Asteroids, planets, stars in some open clusters, as well as molecular clouds
appear to possess a preferential spin-orbit alignment, pointing to shared
processes that tie their rotation at birth to larger parent structures. We
present a new mechanism that describes how collections of particles or 'clouds'
gain a prograde rotational component when they collapse or contract while
subject to an external, central force. The effect is geometric in origin, as
relative shear on curved orbits moves their shared center-of-mass slightly
inward and toward the external potential during a collapse, exchanging orbital
angular momentum into aligned (prograde) rotation. We perform illustrative
analytical and N-body calculations to show that this process of prograde
spin-up proceeds quadratically in time ($\delta L_\mathrm{rot} \propto t^2$)
until the collapse nears completion. The total rotational gain increases with
the size of the cloud prior to its collapse: $\delta
L_\mathrm{rot}/L_\mathrm{H} \propto (R_\mathrm{cl}/R_\mathrm{H})^5$, and
typically with distance to the source of the potential ($L_\mathrm{H}\propto
r_0)$. For clouds that form at the interface of shear and self-gravity
($R_\mathrm{cl} \sim R_\mathrm{H}$), prograde spin-up means that even setups
with large initial retrograde rotation collapse to form prograde-spinning
objects. Being a geometric effect, prograde spin-up persists around any central
potential that triggers shear, even those where the shear is strongly
retrograde. We highlight an application to the Solar System, where prograde
spin-up can explain the frequency of binary objects in the Kuiper belt with
prograde rotation.

Title:Common envelope binary interaction simulations between a thermally-pulsating AGB star and a low mass companion,"
Abstract:  At least one in five of all planetary nebulae are the product of a common
envelope (CE) interaction, where the companion in-spirals into the envelope of
an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star ejecting the nebula and leaving behind a
compact binary. In this work we carry out 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics
simulations of the CE interaction between a 1.7 $M_{\odot}$ AGB star and a 0.6
$M_{\odot}$ companion. We model the AGB structure using a 1D stellar model
taken at the seventh thermal pulse. The interaction takes place when the giant
is on the expanding phase of the seventh thermal pulse and has a radius of 250
$R_{\odot}$. The post-CE orbital separations varies between 20 and 31
$R_{\odot}$, with the inclusion of recombination energy resulting in wider
separations. Based on the observed short in-spiral time-scales, we suggest that
thermal pulses can trigger CEs, extending the ability of AGB stars to capture
companions into CEs, that would lead to the prediction of a larger population
of post-AGB, post-CE binaries. Simulations that include a tabulated equation of
state unbind a great deal more gas, likely unbinding the entire envelope on
short time-scales. The shape of the CE after the in-spiral is more spherical
for AGB than red giant branch stars, and even more so if recombination energy
is included. We expect that the planetary nebula formed from this CE will have
different features from those predicted by Zou et al. 2020.

the rate of captures by extrasolar systems, accounting for several distinct
mechanisms. We find that the capture rate is negligible unless PBHs account for
the entirety of dark matter in a narrow mass range just above the threshold of
existing constraints from evaporation. In this scenario, luminous evaporating
PBHs may be detectable by exoplanet searches.

Title:Prospects for 21cm-Galaxy Cross-Correlations with HERA and the Roman High-Latitude Survey,"
Abstract:  The cross-correlation between the 21 cm field and the galaxy distribution is
a potential probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The 21 cm signal traces
neutral gas in the intergalactic medium and, on large spatial scales, this
should be anti-correlated with the high-redshift galaxy distribution which
partly sources and tracks the ionized gas. In the near future, interferometers
such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) are projected to
provide extremely sensitive measurements of the 21 cm power spectrum. At the
same time, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will produce the most
extensive catalog to date of bright galaxies from the EoR. Using semi-numeric
simulations of reionization, we explore the prospects for measuring the
cross-power spectrum between the 21 cm and galaxy fields during the EoR. We
forecast a 14$\sigma$ detection between HERA and Roman, assuming an overlapping
survey area of 500 deg$^2$, redshift uncertainties of $\sigma_z = 0.01$ (as
expected for the high-latitude spectroscopic survey of Ly$\alpha$-emitting
galaxies), and an effective Ly$\alpha$ emitter duty cycle of $f_\mathrm{LAE} =
0.1$. Thus the HERA-Roman cross-power spectrum may be used to help verify 21 cm
detections from HERA. We find that the shot-noise in the galaxy distribution is
a limiting factor for detection, and so supplemental observations using Roman
should prioritize deeper observations, rather than covering a wider field of
view.

Title:On the impact of runaway stars on dwarf galaxies with resolved interstellar medium,"
Abstract:  About ten to 20 percent of massive stars may be kicked out of their natal
clusters before exploding as supernovae. These ""runaway stars"" might play a
crucial role in driving galactic outflows and enriching the circumgalactic
medium with metals. To study this effect, we carry out high resolution dwarf
galaxy simulations that include velocity kicks to massive O/B stars above 8
M$_{\odot}$. We consider two scenarios, one that adopts a power law velocity
distribution for kick velocities, resulting in more stars with high velocity
kicks, and a more moderate scenario with a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We
explicitly resolve the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), and include
non-equilibrium cooling and chemistry channels. We adopt a resolved feedback
scheme (\textsc{Griffin}) where we sample individual massive stars from an IMF.
We follow the lifetime of these stars and add their photoionising radiation,
their UV radiation field, and their photoelectric heating rate to the
surrounding gas. At the end of their lifetime we explode the massive population
as core collapse supernovae (CCSN). In the simulations with runaway massive
stars, we add additional (natal) velocity kicks that mimic two and three body
interactions that cannot be fully resolved in our simulations. We find that the
inclusion of runaway or walkaway star scenarios has an impact on mass, metal,
momentum and energy outflows as well as the respective loading factors. We find
an increase in mass, metal and momentum loading by a factor of 2-3, whereas we
find an increase in the mean energy loading by a factor of 5 in the runaway
case and a factor of 3 in the walkaway case. However, we find that the peak
values are increased by a factor of up to 10, independent of the adopted
velocity kick model. We conclude that the inclusion of runaway stars could have
a significant impact on the global outflow properties of dwarf galaxies.

"Title:Multi-line observations of CH$_{3}$OH, c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ and HNCO towards L1544: Dissecting the core structure with chemical differentiation","
Abstract:  Pre-stellar cores are the basic unit for the formation of stars and stellar
systems. The anatomy of the physical and chemical structures of pre-stellar
cores is critical for understanding the star formation process. L1544 is a
prototypical pre-stellar core, which shows significant chemical differentiation
surrounding the dust peak. We aim to constrain the physical conditions at the
different molecular emission peaks. This study allows us to compare the
abundance profiles predicted from chemical models together with the classical
density structure of Bonnor-Ebert (BE) sphere. We conducted multi-transition
pointed observations of CH$_{3}$OH, c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ and HNCO with the IRAM 30m
telescope, towards the dust peak and the respective molecular peaks of L1544.
With non-LTE radiative transfer calculations and a 1-dimensional model, we
revisit the physical structure of L1544, and benchmark with the abundance
profiles from current chemical models. We find that the HNCO, c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$
and CH$_{3}$OH lines in L1544 are tracing progressively higher density gas,
from $\sim$10$^{4}$ to several times 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$. Particularly, we find
that to produce the observed intensities and ratios of the CH$_{3}$OH lines, a
local gas density enhancement upon the BE sphere is required. This suggests
that the physical structure of an early-stage core may not necessarily follow a
smooth decrease of gas density profile locally, but can be intercepted by
clumpy substructures surrounding the gravitational center. Multiple transitions
of molecular lines from different molecular species can provide a tomographic
view of the density structure of pre-stellar cores. The local gas density
enhancement deviating from the BE sphere may reflect the impact of accretion
flows that appear asymmetric and are enhanced at the meeting point of
large-scale cloud structures.

Abstract:  Thomson scattered photospheric light is the dominant constituent of the lower
solar corona's spectral continuum viewed off-limb at optical wavelengths. Known
as the K-corona, it is also linearly polarized. We investigate the possibility
of using the a priori polarized characteristics of the K-corona, together with
polarized emission lines, to measure and correct instrument-induced polarized
crosstalk. First, we derive the Stokes parameters of Thomson scattering of
unpolarized light in an irreducible spherical tensor formalism. This allows
forward synthesis of the Thomson scattered signal for the more complex scenario
of symmetry-breaking features in the incident radiation field, which could
limit the accuracy of our proposed technique. For this, we make use of an
advanced 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic coronal model. Together with
synthesized polarized signals in the Fe XIII 10746 Angstrom emission line, we
find that an ad hoc correction of telescope and instrument-induced polarization
crosstalk is possible under the assumption of a non-depolarizing optical
system.

for the first time, the possibility of the appearance of spin-3/2 $\Delta$
baryons in magnetars. We make use of two different relativistic models for the
equation of state of dense matter under the influence of strong magnetic fields
considering the effects of Landau levels and the anomalous magnetic moment
(AMM) proportional to the spin of all baryons and leptons. In particular, we
analyze the effects of the AMM of $\Delta$ baryons in dense matter for the
first time. {We also obtain global properties corresponding to the EoS models
numerically and study the corresponding role of the $\Delta$ baryons.} We find
that they are favored over hyperons, which causes an increase in isopin
asymmetry and a decrease in spin polarization. We also find that, contrary to
what generally occurs when new degrees of freedom are introduced, the $\Delta$s
do not make the EoS significantly softer and magnetars less massive. Finally,
the magnetic field distribution inside a given star is not affected by the
presence of $\Delta$s.

Title:Reconstruction of photospheric velocity fields from highly corrupted data,"
Abstract:  The analysis of the photospheric velocity field is essential for
understanding plasma turbulence in the solar surface, which may be responsible
for driving processes such as magnetic reconnection, flares, wave propagation,
particle acceleration, and coronal heating. Currently, the only available
methods to estimate velocities at the solar photosphere transverse to an
observer's line of sight infer flows from differences in image structure in
successive observations. Due to data noise, algorithms such as local
correlation tracking (LCT) may lead to a vector field with wide gaps where no
velocity vectors are provided. In this letter, a novel method for image
inpainting of highly corrupted data is proposed and applied to the restoration
of horizontal velocity fields in the solar photosphere. The restored velocity
field preserves all the vector field components present in the original field.
The method shows robustness when applied to both simulated and observational
data.

Title:On the Effect of Stellar Activity on Low-resolution Transit Spectroscopy and the Use of High Resolution as Mitigation,"
Abstract:  We present models designed to quantify the effects of stellar activity on
exoplanet transit spectroscopy and atmospheric characterization at low (R =
100) and high (R = 100,000) spectral resolution. We study three model classes
mirroring planetary system archetypes: a hot Jupiter around an early-K star (HD
189733 b); a mini-Neptune around an early-M dwarf (K2-18 b); and terrestrial
planets around a late M dwarf (TRAPPIST-1). We map photospheres with
temperatures and radial velocities (RV) and integrate specific intensity
stellar models. We obtain transit spectra affected by stellar contamination,
the Rossiter--McLaughlin effect (RME), and center-to-limb variations (CLV). We
find that, at low resolution, for later-type stars, planetary water features
become difficult to distinguish from contamination. Many distributions of
unocculted active regions can induce planetary-like features of similar
amplitudes in the case of a late M dwarf. Atmospheric characterization of
planets around late-type stars will likely continue to suffer from degeneracy
with stellar activity unless active regions' parameters can be constrained
using additional information. For the early-K star, stellar contamination
mostly manifests itself through a slope at optical wavelengths similar to
Rayleigh scattering. In all cases, contamination induces offsets in measured
planet radii. At high resolution, we show that we can determine the origin of
$\text{H}_2$O and CO detection signals and lift the degeneracy observed at low
resolution, provided sufficient planet RV variation during transit and adequate
correction for the RME and CLV when required. High-resolution spectroscopy may
therefore help resolve issues arising from stellar contamination for favorable
systems.

Title:Is Thermohaline Mixing the Full Story? Evidence for Separate Mixing Events near the Red Giant Branch Bump,"
Abstract:  The abundances of mixing--sensitive elements including lithium, [C/N], and
12C/13C are known to change near the red giant branch bump. The explanation
most often offered for these alterations is double diffusive thermohaline
mixing in the stellar interior. In this analysis, we investigate the ability of
thermohaline mixing to explain the observed timing of these chemical depletion
events. Recent observational measurements of lithium and [C/N] show that the
abundance of lithium decreases before the abundance of [C/N], whereas numerical
simulations of the propagation of the thermohaline mixing region computed with
MESA show that the synthetic abundances drop simultaneously. We therefore
conclude that thermohaline mixing alone cannot explain the distinct events of
lithium depletion and [C/N] depletion, as the simultaneity predicted by
simulations is not consistent with the observation of separate drops. We thus
invite more sophisticated theoretical explanations for the observed temporal
separation of these chemical depletion episodes as well as more extensive
observational explorations across a range of masses and metallicities.

Title:Type Ia supernova ejecta-donor interaction: explosion model comparison,"
Abstract:  In the single-degenerate scenario of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the
interaction between high-speed ejected material and the donor star in a binary
system is expected to lead to mass being stripped from the donor. A series of
multi-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of ejecta-donor interaction have
been performed in previous studies most of which adopt either a simplified
analytical model or the W7 model to represent a normal SN Ia explosion. Whether
different explosion mechanisms can significantly affect the results of

hydrodynamical ejecta interactions with a main-sequence (MS) donor star in two

explosion in simulations with the W7 deflagration and N100 delayed-detonation

86 km/s, respectively, in each case. The modal velocity, about 500 km/s, of
stripped hydrogen-rich material in the N100 model is faster than the W7 model,
with modal velocity of about 350km/s, by a factor 1.4. Based on our results, we
conclude that the choice of near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion model for normal
SNe Ia seems to not significantly alter the ejecta-donor interaction for a
given main-sequence donor model, at least in 2D.

Title:Modelling self-interacting dark matter substructures I: Calibration with N-body simulations of a Milky-Way-sized halo and its satellite,"
Abstract:  We study evolution of single subhaloes with their masses of $\sim10^9
M_\odot$ in a Milky-Way-sized host halo for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM)
models. We perform dark-matter-only N-body simulations of dynamical evolution
of individual subhaloes orbiting its host by varying self-scattering cross
sections (including a velocity-dependent scenario), subhalo orbits, and
internal properties of the subhalo. We calibrate a gravothermal fluid model to
predict time evolution in spherical mass density profiles of isolated SIDM
haloes with the simulations. We find that tidal effects of SIDM subhaloes can
be described with a framework developed for the case of collision-less cold
dark matter (CDM), but a shorter typical time scale for the mass loss due to
tidal stripping is required to explain our SIDM simulation results. As long as
the cross section is less than $\sim10\, \mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$ and initial
states of subhaloes are set within a $2\sigma$-level scatter at redshifts of
$\sim2$ predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, our simulations do
not exhibit a prominent feature of gravothermal collapse in the subhalo central
density for 10 Gyr. We develop a semi-analytic model of SIDM subhaloes in a
time-evolving density core of the host with tidal stripping and self-scattering
ram pressure effects. Our semi-analytic approach provides a simple, efficient
and physically-intuitive prediction of SIDM subhaloes, but further improvements
are needed to account for baryonic effects in the host and the gravothermal
instability accelerated by tidal stripping effects.

Title:Laboratory measurements of stretching band strengths of deuterated Quenched Carbonaceous Composites (D-QCC),"
Abstract:  The observed large variation in the abundance of deuterium (D) in the
interstellar medium (ISM) suggests that a significant fraction of D may be
depleted into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Signatures of
deuteration of PAHs are expected to appear most clearly through C-D stretching
modes at 4.4--4.7 micron, whose strengths in emission spectra relative to those
of C-H stretching modes at 3.3--3.5 micron provide the relative abundance of D
to hydrogen (H) in PAHs once we have accurate relative band strengths of both
stretching modes. We report experimental results of the band strength of C-D
stretching modes relative to C-H. We employ a laboratory analogue of
interstellar carbonaceous dust, Quenched Carbonaceous Composite (QCC), and
synthesize deuterated QCC (D-QCC) by replacing the starting gas of CH$_4$ of
QCC by mixtures of CH$_4$ and CD$_4$ with various ratios. Infrared spectra of
D-QCC are taken to estimate the relative band strengths of the stretching
modes, while the D/H ratios in the D-QCC samples are measured with a nano-scale
secondary ion mass spectrometer (NanoSIMS). We obtain that the relative
strength of aromatic and aliphatic C-D to C-H stretches is 0.56 +/- 0.04 and
0.38 +/- 0.01 per D/H, respectively. The ratio for the aromatic stretches is in
good agreement with the results of theoretical calculations, while that of
aliphatic stretches is smaller than that of aromatic. The present results do
not significantly change the D/H ratios in the interstellar PAHs previously
estimated from observed spectra.

Title:Revisit the rate of tidal disruption events: the role of the partial tidal disruption event,"
Abstract:  Tidal disruption of stars in dense nuclear star clusters containing
supermassive central black holes (SMBH) is modeled by high-accuracy direct
N-body simulation. Stars getting too close to the SMBH are tidally disrupted
and a tidal disruption event (TDE) happens. TDEs probe properties of SMBH,
their accretion disks, and the surrounding nuclear stellar cluster. In this
paper we compare rates of full tidal disruption events (FTDE) with partial
tidal disruption events (PTDE). Since a PTDE does not destroy the star, a
leftover object emerges; we use the term 'leftover star' for it; two novel
effects occur in the simulation: (1) variation of the leftover star's mass and
radius, (2) variation of the leftover star's orbital energy. After switching on
these two effects in our simulation, the number of FTDEs is reduced by roughly
28%, and the reduction is mostly due to the ejection of the leftover stars from
PTDEs coming originally from relatively large distance. The number of PTDEs is
about 75% higher than the simple estimation given by Stone et al. (2020), and
the enhancement is mainly due to the multiple PTDEs produced by the leftover
stars residing in the diffusive regime. We compute the peak mass fallback rate
for the PTDEs and FTDEs recorded in the simulation, and find 58% of the PTDEs
have peak mass fallback rate exceeding the Eddington limit, and the number of
super-Eddington PTDEs is 2.3 times the number of super-Eddington FTDEs.

Title:The Dependence of Stellar Activity Cycles on Effective Temperature,"
Abstract:  This paper proposes the idea that the observed dependence of stellar activity
cycles on rotation rate can be a manifestation of a stronger dependence on the
effective temperature. Observational evidence is recalled and theoretical
arguments are given for the presence of cyclic activity in the case of
sufficiently slow rotation only. Slow rotation means proximity to the observed
upper bound on the rotation period of solar-type stars. This maximum rotation
period depends on temperature and shortens for hotter stars. The maximum
rotation period is interpreted as the minimum rotation rate for operation of a
large-scale dynamo. A combined model for differential rotation and the dynamo
is applied to stars of different mass rotating with a rate slightly above the
threshold rate for the dynamo. Computations show shorter dynamo cycles for
hotter stars. As the hotter stars rotate faster, the computed cycles are also
shorter for faster rotation. The observed smaller upper bound for rotation
period of hotter stars can be explained by the larger threshold amplitude of
the $\alpha$-effect for onset of their dynamos: a larger $\alpha$ demands
faster rotation. The amplitude of the (cycling) magnetic energy in the
computations is proportional to the difference between the rotation period and
its upper bound for the dynamo. Stars with moderately different rotation rates
can differ significantly in super-criticality of their dynamos and therefore in
their magnetic activity, as observed.

Title:Generating extremely large-volume reionisation simulations,"
Abstract:  Preparing for the first detection of the cosmic 21-cm signal from large-scale
interferometer experiments requires rigorous testing of the data analysis and
reduction pipelines. To validate that these pipelines do not erroneously remove
or add features that can mimic the cosmic signal (e.g. from side-lobes or
large-scale power leakage), we require reionisation simulations larger than the
experiments primary field of view. For an experiment such as the MWA, with a
field of view of $\sim25^{2}$ deg.$^{2}$, this would require a simulation of
several Gpcs, which is currently infeasible. To overcome this, we developed a
simplified version of the semi-numerical reionisation simulation code 21CMFAST
preferencing large volumes over some physical accuracy by assuming linear
theory for structure formation. With this, we constructed a 7.5 Gpc comoving
volume with voxel resolution of $\sim1.17$ cMpc tailored specifically to the
binned spectral resolution of the MWA. This simulation was used for validating
the pipelines for the 2020 MWA 21-cm power spectrum (PS) upper limits (Trott et
al.). We then use this large-volume simulation to explore: (i) whether smaller
volume simulations are biased by the missing large-scale modes, (ii)
non-Gaussianity in estimates of the cosmic variance, (iii) biases in the
recovered 21-cm PS following foreground wedge removal and (iv) the impact of
tiling smaller volume simulations to achieve extremely large volumes. In
summary, we find: (i) no biases from missing large-scale power, (ii)
significant contribution from non-Gaussianity in the cosmic variance as
expected following Mondal et al. (iii) an over-estimate of the 21-cm PS of
10-20 per cent following wedge mode excision for our particular model and (iv)
tiling smaller volume simulations under-estimates the large-scale power and
also the estimated cosmic variance.

Title:On the X-ray pulsar HD 49798: a contracting white dwarf with debris disk?,"
Abstract:  HD49798/RX J0648.0-4418 is a peculiar binary including a hot subdwarf of O
spectral type and a compact companion in a 1.55 day orbit. According to the
steady spin period derivative $\dot{P}=(-2.17\pm0.01)\times10^{-15} ~\rm
s\,s^{-1}$ , the compact object was thought to be a contracting young white
dwarf (WD). However, the X-ray luminosity producing by the wind accretion of
massive WD is one order of magnitude smaller than the observed value. In this
work, we propose an alternative model to account for the observed X-ray
luminosity. If the WD was surrounded by a debris disk, the accretion from the
debris disk can produce the observed X-ray luminosity and X-ray pulses. Based
on the time-varying accretion rate model, the current mass of the debris disk
is constrained to be $3.9\times10^{-6}~\rm M_{\odot}$. Comparing with the
contraction of the WD, the accretion torque exerting by such a debris disk can
only influence the spin evolution of the WD in the early stage. According to
the accretion theory, the magnetic field of the WD is constrained to be $\sim
(0.7-7)\times10^{4}$ G. The calculated conventional polar cap radius of the WD
is larger than the observed emitting-zone radius, which probably originate from
the existence of strong and small-scale local magnetic field in the polar cap
surface. We expect that further multiband observations on this source can help
us to confirm or rule out the existence of a debris disk.

Title:Charge Exchange X-ray Emission Detected in Multiple Shells of Supernova Remnant G296.1-0.5,"
Abstract:  Recent high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy revealed possible presence of
charge exchange (CX) X-ray emission in supernova remnants (SNRs). Although CX
is expected to take place at outermost edges of SNR shells, no significant
measurement has been reported so far due to the lack of nearby SNR samples.
Here we present an X-ray study of SNR G296.1$-$0.5, which has a complicated
multiple-shell structure, with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS)
onboard XMM-Newton. We select two shells in different regions and find that in
both regions O VII line shows a high forbidden-to-resonance ($f/r$) ratio that
cannot be reproduced by a simple thermal model. Our spectral analysis suggests
a presence of CX and the result is also supported by our new radio observation,
where we discover evidence of molecular clouds associated with these shells.
Assuming G296.1$-$0.5 has a spherical shock, we estimate that CX is dominant in
a thin layer with a thickness of 0.2--0.3\% of the shock radius. The result is
consistent with a previous theoretical expectation and we therefore conclude
that CX occurs in G296.1$-$0.5.

Title:Growth after the streaming instability: The radial distance dependence of the planetary growth,"
Abstract:  Streaming instability is hypothesized to be triggered at particular
protoplanetary disk locations where the volume density of the solid particles
is enriched comparable to that of the gas. A ring of planetesimals thus forms
when this condition is fulfilled locally. These planetesimals collide with each
other and accrete inward drifting pebbles from the outer disk to further
increase masses. We investigate the growth of the planetesimals that form in a
ring-belt at various disk radii. Their initial mass distributions are
calculated based on the formula summarized from the streaming instability
simulations. We simulate the subsequent dynamical evolution of the
planetesimals with a protoplanetary disk model based either on the minimum mass
solar nebula (MMSN) or on the Toomre stability criterion. For the MMSN model,
both pebble accretion and planetesimal accretion are efficient at a close-in
orbit of $0.3$ AU, resulting in the emergence of several super-Earth mass
planets after $1$ Myr. For comparison, only the most massive planetesimals
undergo substantial mass growth when they are born at $r{=}3$ AU, while the
planetesimals at $r{=}30$ AU experience little or no growth. On the other hand,
in the denser Toomre disk, the most massive forming planets can reach Earth
mass at $t{=}1$ Myr and reach a mass between that of Neptune and that of Saturn
within $3$ Myr at $30$ AU and $100$ AU. Both the pebble and planetesimal
accretion rate decrease with disk radial distance. Nevertheless, planetesimal
accretion is less pronounced than pebble accretion at more distant disk
regions. Taken together, the planets acquire higher masses when the disk has a
higher gas density, a higher pebble flux, and/or a lower Stokes number of
pebbles.

Title:BeyondPlanck XII. Cosmological parameter constraints with end-to-end error propagation,"
Abstract:  We present cosmological parameter constraints as estimated using the Bayesian
BeyondPlanck (BP) analysis framework. This method supports seamless end-to-end
error propagation from raw time-ordered data to final cosmological parameters.
As a first demonstration of the method, we analyze time-ordered Planck LFI
observations, combined with selected external data (WMAP 33-61GHz, Planck HFI
DR4 353 and 857GHz, and Haslam 408MHz) in the form of pixelized maps which are
used to break critical astrophysical degeneracies. Overall, all results are
generally in good agreement with previously reported values from Planck 2018
and WMAP, with the largest relative difference for any parameter of about 1
sigma when considering only temperature multipoles between 29<l<601. In cases
where there are differences, we note that the BP results are generally slightly
closer to the high-l HFI-dominated Planck 2018 results than previous analyses,
suggesting slightly less tension between low and high multipoles. Using low-l
polarization information from LFI and WMAP, we find a best-fit value of
tau=0.066 +/- 0.013, which is higher than the low value of tau=0.051 +/- 0.006
derived from Planck 2018 and slightly lower than the value of 0.069 +/- 0.011
derived from joint analysis of official LFI and WMAP products. Most
importantly, however, we find that the uncertainty derived in the BP processing
is about 30% larger than when analyzing the official products, after taking
into account the different sky coverage. We argue that this is due to
marginalizing over a more complete model of instrumental and astrophysical
parameters, and this results in both more reliable and more rigorously defined
uncertainties. We find that about 2000 Monte Carlo samples are required to
achieve robust convergence for low-resolution CMB covariance matrix with 225
independent modes.

Title:Revisiting the Affleck-Dine mechanism for primordial black hole formation,"
Abstract:  We study a primordial black hole (PBH) formation scenario based on the
Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism and investigate two PBH mass regions: $M \sim 30
M_\odot$ motivated by the LIGO-Virgo observations of the binary black hole
mergers and $M \gtrsim 10^4 M_\odot$ motivated by the observations of
supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. In the previous studies, it
has been considered that the inhomogeneous AD baryogenesis generates regions
with a large baryon asymmetry, some of which collapse into PBHs. In this paper,
we show that this scenario is severely constrained due to the baryon asymmetry
remaining outside PBHs, which would spoil the success of the big bang
nucleosynthesis. Then, we propose an alternative scenario where the AD
leptogenesis results in the inhomogeneous formation of Q-balls with lepton
charges, which collapse into PBHs. As a result, we find that our scenario can
explain the favorable PBH abundance without conflicting with the observational
constraints.

Title:Transient two pole accretion in the polar V496 UMa,"
Abstract:  We report XMM-Newton and TESS observations of V496 UMa, an AM Herculis-type
cataclysmic variable. The XMM-Newton observation reveals that at times, two
poles on the white dwarf accrete simultaneously, but accretion onto the
secondary magnetic pole is erratic and can nearly cease in less than one binary
orbit (1.5 h). Modelling of the X-ray spectrum during the primary maximum
reveals no change in the accretion structures onto the primary pole when
accretion onto the secondary pole is disrupted, suggesting that the disruption
of accretion onto the secondary pole may be caused by mass-transfer variations
from the donor star. The TESS observation, which spanned eight weeks at a
two-minute cadence, shows a stable, double-humped orbital modulation due to
cyclotron emission from the post-shock region, while the observed times of
maximum light show a slow systematic drift that does not correlate with the
system's overall brightness.

Title:The disk of FU Orionis viewed with MATISSE/VLTI: first interferometric observations in $L$ and $M$ bands,"
Abstract:  The disk of FU Orionis is marginally resolved with MATISSE, suggesting that
the region emitting in the thermal infrared is rather compact. An upper limit
of $\sim1.3\pm0.1$ mas (in $L$) can be given for the diameter of the disk
region probed in the $L$ band, corresponding to 0.5 au at the adopted Gaia EDR3
distance. This represents the hot, gaseous region of the accretion disk. The
$N$-band data indicate that the dusty passive disk is silicate-rich. Only the
innermost region of said dusty disk is found to emit strongly in the $N$ band,
and it is resolved at an angular size of $\sim5$ mas, which translates to a
diameter of about 2 au. The observations therefore place stringent constraints
for the outer radius of the inner accretion disk. Dust radiative transfer
simulations with RADMC-3D provide adequate fits to the spectral energy
distribution from the optical to the submillimeter and to the interferometric
observables when opting for an accretion rate $\dot{M}\sim 2\times 10^{-5}\,
M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and assuming $M_*=0.6\, M_\odot$. Most importantly, the hot
inner accretion disk's outer radius can be fixed at 0.3 au. The outer radius of
the dusty disk is placed at 100 au, based on constraints from scattered-light
images in the literature. The dust mass contained in the disk is
$2.4\times10^{-4}\, M_\odot$, and for a typical gas-to-dust ratio of 100, the
total mass in the disk is approximately 0.02 $M_\odot$. We did not find any
evidence for a nearby companion in the current interferometric data, and we
tentatively explored the case of disk misalignment. For the latter, our
modeling results suggest that the disk orientation is similar to that found in
previous imaging studies by ALMA. Should there be an asymmetry in the very
compact, inner accretion disk, this might be resolved at even smaller spatial
scales ($\leq1$ mas).

Title:The Detection of Transiting Exoplanets by Gaia,"
Abstract:  Context: The space telescope Gaia is dedicated mainly to performing
high-precision astrometry, but also spectroscopy and epoch photometry which can
be used to study various types of photometric variability. One such variability
type is exoplanetary transits. The photometric data accumulated so far have
finally matured enough to allow the detection of some exoplanets.
Aims: In order to fully exploit the scientific potential of Gaia, we search
its photometric data for the signatures of exoplanetary transits.
Methods: The search relies on a version of the Box-Least-Square (BLS) method,
applied to a set of stars prioritized by machine-learning classification
methods. An independent photometric validation was obtained using the public
full-frame images of TESS. In order to validate the first two candidates,
radial-velocity follow-up observations were performed using the spectrograph
PEPSI of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT).
Results: The radial-velocity measurements confirm that two of the candidates
are indeed hot Jupiters. Thus, they are the first exoplanets detected by Gaia -
Gaia-1b and Gaia-2b.
Conclusions: Gaia-1b and Gaia-2b demonstrate that the approach presented in
this paper is indeed effective. This approach will be used to assemble a set of
additional exoplanet candidates, to be released in Gaia third data release,
ensuring better fulfillment of the exoplanet detection potential of Gaia.

Abstract:  Galaxy rotation curves are considered to be convincing evidence for dark

It is shown how the speed of sound squared can be expressed in terms of

polar. The light curves of both satellites, TESS and XMM-Newton, reveal a
double-humped pattern modulated with the periodicity of $91.058467 \pm 0.00001$
minutes. V496 UMa displays a two-pole accretion geometry in the high accretion
state. X-ray spectra from both regions are composed of thermal plasma radiation
and soft blackbody components with almost identical temperatures and a total
accretion rate of $\dot{M}=1.4(8)\times10^{-11}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The
X-ray centers of the humps show longitudinal shifts of -18 and 4 degrees and
-172 and -186 degrees size around photometric phase zero, for the main hump and
second hump, respectively. The long-term ZTF light curves reveal high and low
accretions states. Low-state ZTF and SDSS photometric data are consistent with
an $0.8$ M$_{\odot}$ white dwarf at 10000 K and a main-sequence donor star with
a spectral type of M5.0 at a \gai-determined distance of 758 pc. V496 UMa is a
very bright polar in X-rays when it is in the high state. Due to its unusual
geometric structure, mass accretion onto the second accretion pole is
interrupted occasionally. This discontinuous behavior does not follow a certain
pattern in time and is observed so far only in the high state. The X-ray light
curves display clear evidence for an accretion stream at the photometric phase
of $\phi=$0.81, which does not show up in optical light curves. An accurate
period was derived using the combined TESS and XMM-Newton data, which differs

Abstract:  (Abridged) Exoplanetary research has provided us with exciting discoveries of
planets around very low-mass (VLM) stars (e.g., TRAPPIST-1 and Proxima
Centauri). However, current theoretical models strive to explain planet
formation in these conditions and do not predict the development of giant
planets. Recent high-resolution observations from ALMA of the disk around CIDA
1, a VLM star in Taurus, show substructures hinting at the presence of a
massive planet. We aim to reproduce the dust ring of CIDA 1, observed in the
dust continuum emission in ALMA Band 7 (0.9 mm) and Band 4 (2.1 mm), along with
its $^{12}$CO (J=3-2) and $^{13}$CO (J=3-2) channel maps, assuming the
structures are shaped by the interaction of the disk with a massive planet. We
seek to retrieve the mass and position of the putative planet. We model the
protoplanetary disk with a set of hydrodynamical simulations, varying the mass
and locations of the embedded planet. We compute the dust and gas emission
using radiative transfer simulations, and, finally, we obtain the synthetic
observations treating the images as the actual ALMA observations. Our models
indicate that a planet with a minimum mass of $\sim1.4\,\text{M}_\text{Jup}$
orbiting at a distance of $\sim 9-10$ au can explain the morphology and
location of the observed dust ring at Band 7 and Band 4. We can reproduce the
low spectral index ($\sim 2$) observed where the dust ring is detected. Our
synthetic images reproduce the morphology of the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO
observed channel maps where the cloud absorption allowed a detection. Applying
an empirical relation between planet mass and gap width in the dust, we predict
a maximum planet mass of $\sim4 - 8\,\text{M}_\text{Jup}$. Our results suggest
the presence of a massive planet orbiting CIDA 1, thus challenging our
understanding of planet formation around VLM stars.

Abstract:  This paper explicates the concept of an Intermediate Point (IP), its

Vinfnity Leveraging Manoeuvres (VLM). The SOM has been established
theoretically as an important mechanism by which rapid exit from the solar
system and intercept of ISOs can both be achieved; the VLM has been
demonstrated practically as a method of reducing overall mission Delta-V as
well as the Characteristic Energy, C3, at launch. Thus via these two
applications, the feasibility of missions to interstellar objects (ISOs) such
as 1I/Oumuamua can be analysed. The interplanetary trajectory optimizer tool
exploited for this analysis, OITS, permits IP selection as an encounter option
along the interplanetary trajectory in question. OITS adopts the assumption of
impulsive thrust at discrete points along the trajectory, an assumption which
is generally valid for high thrust propulsion scenarios, like chemical or

Abstract:  3C84 (NGC1275) is one of the brightest radio sources in the mm radio-bands,
which led to a plethora of VLBI observations at numerous frequencies over the
years. They reveal a two-sided jet structure, with an expanding but not
well-collimated parsec-scale jet, pointing southward. High resolution mm-VLBI
observations allow the study and imaging of the jet base on the sub-parsec
scale. This could facilitate the investigation of the nature of the jet origin,
also in view of the previously detected two-railed jet structure and east-west
oriented core region seen with RadioAstron at 22 GHz. We produce VLBI images of
this core and inner jet region, observed during the past twenty years at 15,
43, and 86 GHz. We determine the kinematics of the inner jet and ejected
features at 43 and 86 GHz and compare their ejection times with radio and
$\gamma$-ray variability. For the moving jet features, we find an average
velocity of $\beta^\textrm{avg}_\textrm{app} = 0.055-0.22$c ($\mu^\textrm{avg}
= 0.04-0.18\,$mas/yr). From the time-averaged VLBI images at the three
frequencies, we measure the transverse jet width along the bulk flow. On the
$\leq 1.5$ parsec scale, we find a clear trend of the jet width being frequency
dependent, with the jet being narrower at higher frequencies. This
stratification is discussed in the context of a spine-sheath scenario, and is
compared to other possible interpretations. From quasi-simultaneous
observations at 43 and 86\,GHz we obtain spectral index maps, revealing a
time-variable orientation of the spectral index gradient, due to structural
variability of the inner jet.

Title:About the observational check of the mechanism of gamma radiation in Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGR),"
Abstract:  Soft gamma repeaters (SGR) are identified as single neutron stars (NS) inside
the Galaxy, or nearby galaxies, with sporadic transient gamma radiation. A
total number of discovered SGR, including relative Anomalous X-ray pulsars
(AXP), is few tens of objects. Many of them show periodic radiation, connected
with NS rotation, with periods 2-12 s. The slow rotation is accompanied by
small rate of loss of rotational energy, which is considerably smaller than the
observed sporadic gamma ray luminosity, and is many orders less that the
luminosity during giant bursts, observed in 4 SGR. Therefore the energy source
is usually connected with annihilation of very strong NS magnetic field.
Another model is based on release of a nuclear energy stored in the NS
nonequilibrium layer. We suggest here an observational test with could
distinguish between these two models.

Title:A Method for Quantifying Position Reconstruction Uncertainty in Astroparticle Physics using Bayesian Networks,"
Abstract:  Robust position reconstruction is paramount for enabling discoveries in
astroparticle physics as backgrounds are significantly reduced by only
considering interactions within the fiducial volume. In this work, we present
for the first time a method for position reconstruction using a Bayesian
network which provides per interaction uncertainties. We demonstrate the
utility of this method with simulated data based on the XENONnT detector
design, a dual-phase xenon time-projection chamber, as a proof-of-concept. The
network structure includes variables representing the 2D position of the
interaction within the detector, the number of electrons entering the gaseous
phase, and the hits measured by each sensor in the top array of the detector.
The precision of the position reconstruction (difference between the true and
expectation value of position) is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods --
an RMS of 0.69 cm, ~0.09 of the sensor spacing, for the inner part of the
detector (<60 cm) and 0.98 cm, ~0.12 of the sensor spacing, near the wall of
the detector (>60 cm). More importantly, the uncertainty of each interaction
position was directly computed, which is not possible with other reconstruction
methods. The method found a median 3-$\sigma$ confidence region of 11 cm$^2$
for the inner part of the detector and 21 cm$^2$ near the wall of the detector.
We found the Bayesian network framework to be well suited to the problem of
position reconstruction. The performance of this proof-of-concept, even with
several simplifying assumptions, shows that this is a promising method for
providing per interaction uncertainty, which can be extended to energy
reconstruction and signal classification.

Title:In-situ wavelength calibration without a calibration target: use of Fraunhofer lines after landing on planetary surface,"
Abstract:  Accurate wavelength calibration is critical for qualitative and quantitative
spectroscopic measurements. Many spectrometers for planetary exploration are
equipped with onboard calibration sources. However, such calibration sources
are not always available because planetary lander missions often have strong
limitations in size and mass. In this study, we propose and validate a
wavelength calibration method using solar Fraunhofer lines observed in
reflective spectra. As a result, for a visible Raman spectrometer, the accuracy
is better than 0.6 cm-1 in 0-4000 cm-1 range, and the magnesium abundance of
olivine is estimated more accurately than 2%.

Title:Is the Rees-Sciama effect detectable by the next generation of cosmological experiments?,"
Abstract:  Non-linear growth of structure causes the gravitational potentials to grow
with time, and this leaves an imprint on the small-scale temperature
fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), a signal known as the
Rees-Sciama (RS) effect. Building on previous studies, here we investigate the
detectability of the RS effect by cross-correlating upcoming CMB and
Large-Scale Structure surveys. We include tracers with realistic number density
and bias, realistic noise for upcoming and future CMB experiments, and
importantly, the contribution from CMB foregrounds to the noise budget. We also
derive optimal redshift weights, which are crucial to the detection due to the
mismatch between the redshift kernel of the RS effect and the typical redshift
distribution of current and upcoming galaxy surveys. In agreement with previous
work, we confirm that the signal would in principle be detectable at high
significance by ""white noise"" versions of future CMB experiments, when
foregrounds are not included as part of the noise. However, we show that
inclusion of foregrounds limits the statistical detectability of the signal: an
optimally-weighted high-redshift sample from Rubin Observatory LSST, together
with CMB maps from CMB-S4 or CMB-HD, can yield a detection with signal-to-noise
6 - 8, when taking $\ell_{\rm max} = 6000$, provided that foreground-induced
biases can be successfully controlled. Improvements are possible if the total
power from foregrounds is further reduced, for example by more aggressive
masking, or if the signal can be modeled down to smaller scales.

Title:Tidal disruption of solitons in self-interacting ultralight axion dark matter,"
Abstract:  Ultralight axions (ULAs) are promising dark matter candidates that can have a
distinct impact on the formation and evolution of structure on nonlinear scales
relative to the cold, collisionless dark matter (CDM) paradigm. However, most
studies of structure formation in ULA models do not include the effects of
self-interactions, which are expected to arise generically. Here, we study how
the tidal evolution of solitons is affected by ULA self-interaction strength
and sign. Specifically, using the pseudospectral solver UltraDark.jl, we
simulate the tidal disruption of self-interacting solitonic cores as they orbit
a $10^{11}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ Navarro-Frenk-White CDM host halo potential for
a range of orbital parameters, assuming a fiducial ULA particle mass of
$10^{-22}\mathrm{eV}$. We find that repulsive (attractive) self-interactions
significantly accelerate (decelerate) soliton tidal disruption. We also
identify a degeneracy between the self-interaction strength and soliton mass
that determines the efficiency of tidal disruption, such that disruption
timescales are affected at the $\sim 50\%$ level for variations in the
dimensionless ULA self-coupling from $\lambda=-10^{-92}$ to $\lambda=10^{-92}$.

Title:Searching for Mini Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals with Gravitational-Wave Detectors,"
Abstract:  A compact object with a mass $\mathcal{O}(1 \sim 1000) M_{\odot}$, such as a
black hole of stellar or primordial origin or a neutron star, and a much
lighter exotic compact object with a subsolar mass could form a non-standard
mini extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) and emit gravitational waves within the
frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. These systems are
extremely interesting because detecting them would definitively point to new
physics. We study the capability of using LIGO/Virgo to search for mini-EMRIs
and find that a large class of exotic compact objects can be probed at current
and design sensitivities using a method based on the Hough Transform that
tracks quasi power-law signals during the inspiral phase of the mini-EMRI
system.

Title:There and back again: understanding the critical properties of backsplash galaxies,"
Abstract:  Backsplash galaxies are galaxies that once resided inside a cluster, and have
migrated back outside as they move towards the apocenter of their orbit. The
kinematic properties of these galaxies are well understood, thanks to the
significant study of backsplashers in dark matter-only simulations, but their
intrinsic properties are not well constrained due to modeling uncertainties in
sub-grid physics, ram pressure stripping, dynamical friction, and tidal forces.
In this paper, we use the Illustris-TNG-300-1 simulation, with a baryonic
resolution of $M_{\rm b} \approx 1.1\times 10^7$ M$_\odot$, to study backsplash
galaxies around 1302 isolated galaxy clusters with mass $10^{13.0} < M_{\rm
200,mean} / {\rm M}_\odot< 10^{15.5}$. We employ a decision tree classifier to
extract features of galaxies that make them likely to be backsplash galaxies,
compared to nearby field galaxies, and find that backsplash galaxies have low
gas fractions, high mass-to-light ratios, large stellar sizes, and low black
hole occupation fractions. We investigate in detail the origins of these large
sizes, and hypothesise their origins are linked to the tidal environments in
the cluster. We show that the black hole recentering scheme employed in many
cosmological simulations leads to the loss of black holes from galaxies
accreted into clusters, and suggest improvements to these models. Generally, we
find that backsplash galaxies are a useful population to test and understand
numerical galaxy formation models.

Title:The extinction law in the inner $3\times3$ deg$^2$ of the Milky Way and the red clump absolute magnitude in the inner bar-bulge,"
Abstract:  The extinction law from $0.9$ to $8$ microns in the inner $3\times3$ deg$^2$
of the Milky Way is measured using data from VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea,
GLIMPSE and WISE. Absolute extinction ratios are found by requiring that the
observed red clump density peaks at the GRAVITY collaboration distance to the
Galactic centre. When combined with selective extinction ratios measured from
the bulge giant colour-colour diagrams, we find an extinction law of
$A_Z:A_Y:A_J:A_H:A_{K_s}:A_{W1}:A_{[3.6]}:A_{[4.5]}:A_{W2}:A_{[5.8]}:A_{[8.0]}
=7.19(0.30):5.11(0.20):3.23(0.11):1.77(0.04):1:0.54(0.02):0.46(0.03):0.34(0.03):0.32(0.03):0.24(0.04):0.28(0.03)$
valid for low extinctions where non-linearities are unimportant. These results
imply an extinction law from the Rayleigh Jeans colour excess method (RJCE) of
$A_{K_s}=0.677(H-[4.5]-0.188)$. We find little evidence for significant
selective extinction ratio variation over the inspected region (around $5\%$).
Assuming the absolute extinction ratios do not vary across the inspected region
gives an independent measurement of the absolute $K_s$ magnitude of the red
clump at the Galactic Centre of $(-1.61\pm0.07)\,\mathrm{mag}$. This is very
similar to the value measured for solar neighbourhood red clump stars giving
confidence in the use of red clump stars as standard candles across the Galaxy.
As part of our analysis, we inspect the completeness of PSF photometry from the
VVV survey using artificial star tests, finding $90\%$ completeness at
$K_s\approx16 \,(17)$ in high (low) density regions and good agreement with the
number counts with respect to the GALACTICNUCLEUS and DECAPS catalogues over
small regions of the survey.

"Title:In-situ extreme mass ratio inspirals via sub-parsec formation and migration of stars in thin, gravitationally unstable AGN discs","
Abstract:  We investigate the properties of stars born via gravitational instability in
accretion discs around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic
nuclei (AGN), and how this varies with the SMBH mass, accretion rate, or
viscosity. We show with geometrically thin, steady-state disc solutions that
fragmentation results in different populations of stars when one considers the
initial conditions (e.g. density and temperature of the gravitationally
unstable regions). We find that opacity gaps in discs around $10^6 \rm
M_{\odot}$ SMBHs can trigger fragmentation at radii $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ pc,
although the conditions lead to the formation of initially low stellar masses
primarily at $0.1-0.5 M_{\odot}$. Discs around more massive SMBHs ($M_{\rm BH}
=10^{7-8} M_{\odot}$) form moderately massive or supermassive stars (the
majority at $10^{0-2} M_{\odot}$). Using linear migration estimates, we discuss
three outcomes: stars migrate till they are tidally destroyed, accreted as
extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), or leftover after disc dispersal. For a
single AGN activity cycle, we find a lower-limit for the EMRI rate $R_{\rm
emri}\sim 0-10^{-4} \rm yr^{-1}$ per AGN assuming a SF efficiency $\epsilon=1
\%$. In cases where EMRIs occur, this implies a volumetric rate up to $0.5-10
\rm yr^{-1} Gpc^{-3}$ in the local Universe. The rates are particularly
sensitive to model parameters for $M_{\rm BH}=10^6 M_{\odot}$, for which EMRIs
only occur if stars can accrete to $10$s of solar masses. Our results provide
further evidence that gas-embedded EMRIs can contribute a substantial fraction
of events detectable by milliHz gravitational wave detectors such as LISA. Our
disc solutions suggest the presence of migration traps, as has been found for
more massive SMBH discs. Finally, the surviving population of stars after the
disc lifetime leaves implications for stellar disc populations in galactic
nuclei.

Title:Phase Shifts Measured in Evanescent Acoustic Waves above the Solar Photosphere and Their Possible Impacts to Local Helioseismology,"
Abstract:  A set of 464-min high-resolution high-cadence observations were acquired for
a region near the Sun's disk center using the Interferometric BI-dimensional
Spectrometer (IBIS) installed at the Dunn Solar Telescope. Ten sets of
Dopplergrams are derived from the bisector of the spectral line corresponding
approximately to different atmospheric heights, and two sets of Dopplergrams
are derived using MDI-like algorithm and center-of-gravity method. These data
are then filtered to keep only acoustic modes, and phase shifts are calculated
between Doppler velocities of different atmospheric heights as a function of
acoustic frequency. The analysis of the frequency- and height-dependent phase
shifts shows that for evanescent acoustic waves, oscillations in the higher
atmosphere lead those in the lower atmosphere by an order of 1 s when their
frequencies are below about 3.0 mHz, and lags behind by about 1 s when their
frequencies are above 3.0 mHz. Non-negligible phase shifts are also found in
areas with systematic upward or downward flows. All these frequency-dependent
phase shifts cannot be explained by vertical flows or convective blueshifts,
but are likely due to complicated hydrodynamics and radiative transfer in the
non-adiabatic atmosphere in and above the photosphere. These phase shifts in
the evanescent waves pose great challenges to the interpretation of some local
helioseismic measurements that involve data acquired at different atmospheric
heights or in regions with systematic vertical flows. More quantitative
characterization of these phase shifts is needed so that they can either be
removed during measuring processes or be accounted for in helioseismic
inversions.

Title:Effects of the environment and feedback physics on the initial mass function of stars in the STARFORGE simulations,"
Abstract:  One of the key mysteries of star formation is the origin of the stellar
initial mass function (IMF). The IMF is observed to be nearly universal in the
Milky Way and its satellites, and significant variations are only inferred in
extreme environments, such as the cores of massive elliptical galaxies. In this
work we present simulations from the STARFORGE project that are the first
cloud-scale RMHD simulations that follow individual stars and include all
relevant physical processes. The simulations include detailed gas
thermodynamics, as well as stellar feedback in the form of protostellar jets,
stellar radiation, winds and supernovae. In this work we focus on how stellar
radiation, winds and supernovae impact star-forming clouds. Radiative feedback
plays a major role in quenching star formation and disrupting the cloud,
however the IMF peak is predominantly set by protostellar jet physics. We find
the effect of stellar winds is minor, and supernovae occur too late}to affect
the IMF or quench star formation. We also investigate the effects of initial
conditions on the IMF. The IMF is insensitive to the initial turbulence, cloud
mass and cloud surface density, even though these parameters significantly
shape the star formation history of the cloud, including the final star
formation efficiency. The characteristic stellar mass depends weakly on
metallicity and the interstellar radiation field. Finally, while turbulent
driving and the level of magnetization strongly influences the star formation
history, they only influence the high-mass slope of the IMF.

Title:A statistical primer on exoplanet detection methods,"
Abstract:  Historically, a lack of cross-disciplinary communication has led to the
development of statistical methods for detecting exoplanets by astronomers,
independent of the contemporary statistical literature. The aim of our paper is
to investigate the properties of such methods. Many of these methods (both
transit- and radial velocity-based) have not been discussed by statisticians
despite their use in thousands of astronomical papers. Transit methods aim to
detect a planet by determining whether observations of a star contain a
periodic component. These methods tend to be overly rudimentary for starlight
data and lack robustness to model misspecification. Conversely, radial velocity
methods aim to detect planets by estimating the Doppler shift induced by an
orbiting companion on the spectrum of a star. Many such methods are unable to
detect Doppler shifts on the order of magnitude consistent with Earth-sized
planets around Sun-like stars. Modern radial velocity approaches attempt to
address this deficiency by adapting tools from contemporary statistical
research in functional data analysis, but more work is needed to develop the
statistical theory supporting the use of these models, to expand these models
for multiplanet systems, and to develop methods for detecting ever smaller
Doppler shifts in the presence of stellar activity.

Title:Signatures of R-process Enrichment in Supernovae from Collapsars,"
Abstract:  Despite recent progress, the astrophysical channels responsible for rapid
neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis remain an unsettled question.
Observations of kilonovae following gravitational wave-detected neutron star
mergers established mergers as one site of the r-process, but additional
sources may be needed to fully explain r-process enrichment in the Universe.
One intriguing possibility is that rapidly rotating massive stars undergoing
core collapse launch r-process-rich outflows off the accretion disks formed
from their infalling matter. In this scenario, r-process winds comprise one
component of the supernova (SN) ejecta produced by ""collapsar"" explosions. We
present the first systematic study of the effects of r-process enrichment on
the emission from collapsar-generated SNe. We semi-analytically model r-process
SN emission from explosion out to late times, and determine its distinguishing
features. The ease with which r-process SNe can be identified depends on how
effectively wind material mixes into the initially r-process-free outer layers
of the ejecta. In many cases, enrichment produces a near infrared (NIR) excess
that can be detected within ~75 days of explosion. We also discuss optimal
targets and observing strategies for testing the r-process collapsar theory,
and find that frequent monitoring of optical and NIR emission from
high-velocity SNe in the first few months after explosion offers a reasonable
chance of success while respecting finite observing resources. Such early
identification of r-process collapsar candidates also lays the foundation for
nebular-phase spectroscopic follow-up in the near- and mid-infrared, for
example with the James Webb Space Telescope.

Abstract:  We report new VLA and e-MERLIN high resolution and sensitivity images of the

observations allowed us to perform a deep multi-frequency, multi-epoch study by
exploring the innermost regions (<~100 au) of an intermediate-mass YSO for the
first time, with a physical resolution of ~15 au. The kinematic analysis of
knots recently ejected by the protostar indicates that the jet is undergoing
episodic variations in velocity. In addition, our multi-frequency images reveal
striking characteristics, e.g., a highly collimated ionized stream that would
be launched at a radial distance of ~0.4 au from the protostar, and a narrow
(~28 au wide) ionized cavity that would be excited by the interaction of a
wide-angle component with the surrounding toroid of infalling material. In
light of these results, we propose the scenario in which both a
highly-collimated jet and a wide-angle wind coexist to be the most plausible to
explain our observations, either launched by the X-wind or X- plus Disk-wind
mechanism.

Abstract:  We present a study of the filamentary structure in the atomic hydrogen (HI)
emission at the 21 cm wavelength toward the Galactic plane using the
observations in the HI4PI survey. Using the Hessian matrix method across radial
velocity channels, we identified the filamentary structures and quantified
their orientations using circular statistics. We found that the regions of the
Milky Way's disk beyond 10 kpc and up to roughly 18 kpc from the Galactic
center display HI filamentary structures predominantly parallel to the Galactic
plane. For regions at lower Galactocentric radii, we found that the HI
filaments are mostly perpendicular or do not have a preferred orientation with
respect to the Galactic plane. We interpret these results as the imprint of
supernova feedback in the inner Galaxy and Galactic rotation in the outer Milky
Way. We found that the HI filamentary structures follow the Galactic warp and
that they highlight some of the variations interpreted as the effect of the
gravitational interaction with satellite galaxies. In addition, the mean scale
height of the filamentary structures is lower than that sampled by the bulk of
the HI emission, thus indicating that the cold and warm atomic hydrogen phases
have different scale heights in the outer galaxy. Finally, we found that the
fraction of the column density in HI filaments is almost constant up to
approximately 18 kpc from the Galactic center. This is possibly a result of the
roughly constant ratio between the cold and warm atomic hydrogen phases
inferred from the HI absorption studies. Our results indicate that the HI
filamentary structures provide insight into the dynamical processes shaping the
Galactic disk. Their orientations record how and where the stellar energy
input, the Galactic fountain process, the cosmic ray diffusion, and the gas
accretion have molded the diffuse interstellar medium in the Galactic plane.

Title:Stability analysis of supermassive primordial stars: a new mass range for general relativistic instability supernovae,"
Abstract:  Observed supermassive black holes in the early universe have several proposed
formation channels, in part because most of these channels are difficult to
probe. One of the more promising channels, the direct collapse of a
supermassive star, has several possible probes including the explosion of a
helium-core supermassive star triggered by a general relativistic instability.
We develop a straightforward method for evaluating the general relativistic
radial instability without simplifying assumptions and apply it to population
III supermassive stars taken from a post Newtonian stellar evolution code. This
method is more accurate than previous determinations and it finds that the
instability occurs earlier in the evolutionary life of the star. Using the
results of the stability analysis, we perform 1D general relativistic
hydrodynamical simulations and we find two general relativistic instability
supernovae fueled by alpha capture reactions as well as several lower mass
pulsations, analogous to the puslational pair instability process. The mass
range for the events (2.6-3.0 $\times 10^4$ ${\rm M}_\odot$) is lower than had
been suggested by previous works (5.5 $\times 10^4$ ${\rm M}_\odot$) because
the instability occurs earlier in the star's evolution. The explosion may be
visible to, among others, JWST, while the discovery of the pulsations opens up
additional possibilities for observation.

"Title:Shocks in radiatively driven time dependent, relativistic jets around black holes","
Abstract:  We study time-dependent relativistic jets under the influence of radiation
field of the accretion disk. The accretion disk consists of an inner compact
corona and an outer sub-Keplerian disk. The thermodynamics of the fluid is
governed by a relativistic equation of state (EoS) for multispecies fluid which
enables to study the effect of composition on jet-dynamics. Jets originate from
the vicinity of the central black hole where the effect of gravity is
significant and traverses large distances where only special relativistic
treatment is sufficient. So we have modified the flat metric to include the
effect of gravity. In this modified relativistic framework we have developed a
new total variation diminishing (TVD) routine along with multispecies EoS for
the purpose. We show that the acceleration of jets crucially depends on flow
composition. All the results presented are transonic in nature, starting from
very low injection velocities, the jets can achieve high Lorentz factors. For
sub-Eddington luminosities, lepton dominated jets can be accelerated to Lorentz
factors > 50. The change in radiation field due to variation in the accretion
disk dynamics will be propagated to the jet in a finite amount of time. Hence
any change in radiation field due to a change in disk configuration will affect
the lower part of the jet before it affects the outer part. This can drive
shock transition in the jet flow. Depending upon the disk oscillation
frequency, amplitude and jet parameters these shocks can collide with each
other and may trigger shock cascades.

systems have mass ratios of the order of $10^{-4}$ and the other has a mass
ratio slightly greater than $10^{-3}$. The estimated masses indicate that all
discovered planets have sub-Jovian masses. The planet masses of
KMT-2021-BLG-0320Lb, KMT-2021-BLG-1303Lb, and KMT-2021-BLG-1554Lb correspond to
$\sim 0.10$, $\sim 0.38$, and $\sim 0.12$ times of the mass of the Jupiter, and
the mass of OGLE-2017-BLG-1691Lb corresponds to that of the Uranus. The
estimated mass of the planet host KMT-2021-BLG-1554L, $M_{\rm host}\sim

of the planets well demonstrate the capability of the current high-cadence

left-handed neutrinos in thermal equilibrium with finite temperature and
chemical potential in the radiation dominated era. We compute the correlation
functions of gravitational fields pertinent to the Stokes parameter $V$
characterizing the circular polarization of gravitational waves in the
Minkowski and expanding spacetime backgrounds. In the expanding universe, we
find that the thermalized neutrinos induce a non-vanishing $V$ linear to the
neutrino degeneracy parameter and wavenumber of gravitational waves in the long
wavelength region. While the magnitude of the gravitational waves generated by
thermal neutrinos is too small to be detectable by current and planned third
generation gravitational wave detectors, their observations by future
generation detectors for ultra-high frequency regimes could provide information
on the neutrino degeneracy parameter in the early Universe.

Title:Formation of episodic jets and associated flares from black hole accretion systems,"
Abstract:  Episodic ejections of blobs (episodic jets) are widely observed in black hole
sources and usually associated with flares. In this paper, by performing and
analyzing three dimensional general relativity magnetohydrodynamical numerical
simulations of accretion flows, we investigate their physical mechanisms. We
find that magnetic reconnection occurs in the accretion flow, likely due to the
turbulent motion and differential rotation of the accretion flow, resulting in
flares and formation of flux ropes. Flux ropes formed inside of 10-15
gravitational radii are found to mainly stay within the accretion flow, while
flux ropes formed beyond this radius are ejected outward by magnetic forces and
form the episodic jets. These results confirm the basic scenario proposed in
Yuan et al.(2009). Moreover, our simulations find that the predicted velocity
of the ejected blobs is in good consistency with observations of Sgr A*, M81,
and M87. The whole processes are found to occur quasi-periodically, with the
period being the orbital time at the radius where the flux rope is formed. The
predicted period of flares and ejections is consistent with those found from
the light curves or image of Sgr A*, M87, and PKS 1510-089. The possible
applications to protostellar accretion systems are discussed.

Abstract:  Aim: We aim to refine the orbital and physical parameters and determine the
sky-projected planet orbital obliquity of five eccentric transiting planetary
systems: HAT-P-15, HAT-P-17, HAT-P-21, HAT-P-26, and HAT-P-29. Each of the
systems hosts a hot Jupiter, except for HAT-P-26 which hosts a Neptune-mass
planet. Methods: We observed transit events of these planets with the HARPS-N
spectrograph, obtaining high-precision radial velocity measurements that allow
us to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for each of the target systems. We
used these new HARPS-N spectra and archival data, including those from Gaia, to
better characterise the stellar atmospheric parameters. The photometric
parameters for four of the hot Jupiters were recalculated using 17 new transit
light curves, obtained with an array of medium-class telescopes, and data from
the TESS space telescope. HATNet time-series photometric data were checked for
the signatures of rotation periods of the target stars and their spin axis
inclination. Results: From the analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, we
derived a sky-projected obliquity of 13, -26.3, -0.7, -26 degree for HAT-P-15b,
HAT-P-17b, HAT-P-21b and HAT-P-29b, respectively. Due to the quality of the
data, we were not able to well constrain the sky-projected obliquity for
HAT-P-26b, although a prograde orbit is favoured. The stellar activity of
HAT-P-21 indicates a rotation period of 15.88 days, which allowed us to
determine its true misalignment angle (25 degree). Our new analysis of the
physical parameters of the five exoplanetary systems returned values compatible
with those existing in the literature. Using TESS and the available transit
light curves, we reviewed the orbital ephemeris for the five systems and
confirmed that the HAT-P-26 system shows transit timing variations, which may
tentatively be attributed to the presence of a third body.

Title:Decoding NGC 628 with radiative transfer methods,"
Abstract:  We present an axi-symmetric model for the ultraviolet (UV)-to-submillimetre
(submm) images of the nearly face-on spiral galaxy NGC 628. It was calculated
using a radiative transfer (RT) code, accounting for the absorption and
re-emission of starlight by dust in the interstellar medium of this galaxy. The
code incorporates emission from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, anisotropic
scattering and stochastic heating of the grains. This is the second successful
modelling of a face-on spiral galaxy with RT methods, whereby the large-scale
geometry of stars and dust is self-consistently determined. The solution was
obtained by fitting azimuthally averaged profiles in the UV, optical and submm.
The model predicts remarkably well all characteristics of the profiles,
including the increase by a factor of 1.8 of the scale-length of the infrared
emissivity between 70 and 500 $\mu$m. We find that NGC 628 did not undergo an
efficient inside-out disk growth, as predicted by semi-analytical hierarchical
models for galaxy formation. We also find large amounts of dust grains at large
radii, that could involve efficient transport mechanisms from the inner disk.
Our results show that 71% of the dust emission in NGC 628 is powered by the
young stellar populations, with the old stellar populations from the bulge
contributing 65% to the heating of the dust in the central region ($R<0.5$
kpc). The derived star formation rate is $\rm SFR=2.00\pm0.15\,{\rm
M}_{\odot}{\rm yr}^{-1}$..

Abstract:  We estimated the radiative efficiency and spin value for a number of local
active galactic nuclei with z < 0.34 using 3 popular models connecting the
radiative efficiency with such parameters of AGNs as mass of supermassive black
hole, angle between the line of sight and the axis of the accretion disk and
bolometric luminosity. Analysis of the obtained data shown that the spin value
decreases with cosmic time, which is in agreement with results of theoretical
calculations for low redshift AGNs of other authors. Also we found that the
spin value increases with the increasing mass of SMBH and bolometric
luminosity. This is the expected result that corresponds to theoretical
calculations. Analysis of the distribution of the spin values shown a
pronounced peak in the distribution in 0.75 < a < 1.0 range. ~ 40% of objects

Title:Broad-line Region Clouds orbiting an AGN sample,"
Abstract:  We present a spectral and temporal analysis of XMM-Newton data from a sample
of six galaxies (NGC 3783, Mrk 279, Mrk 766, NGC 3227, NGC 7314, and NGC 3516).
Using the hardness-ratio curves, we identify time-intervals in which clouds are
eclipsing the central X-ray source in five of the six sources. We detect three
occultations in NGC 3227 and one occultation in NGC 3783, NGC 7314, and NGC
3516, together with the well-known occultations in Mrk 766. We estimate the
physical properties of the eclipsing clouds. The derived physical size of the
X-ray sources ($\sim$(3-28)$\times$10$^{13}$ cm) is less than that of the
eclipsing clouds with column densities of $\sim$10$^{22}$-10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$,
thus a single cloud may block the X-ray source, leading to notorious temporal
variability of the X-ray flux. The eclipsing clouds in Mrk 766, NGC 3227, NGC
7314, and NGC 3516 with distances from the X-ray source of
$\sim$(0.3-3.6)$\times$10$^4$ $R_g$ are moving at Keplerian velocities $>$1122
km s$^{-1}$, typical parameters of broad-line region clouds, while the
eclipsing cloud in NGC 3783 is likely located in the dusty torus. We also find
a good anti-correlation with a slope of -187$\pm$62 between the known masses of
the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxies with the equivalent
width (EW) of the 6.4 keV Fe line for the five Seyfert 1 galaxies of our
sample, while the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7314 shows an average EW value of
100$\pm$11 eV inconsistent with the above anti-correlation.

Title:Astrophysical implications on hyperon couplings and hyperon star properties with relativistic equations of states,"
Abstract:  Hyperons are essential constituents in the neutron star interior. The
poorly-known hyperonic interaction is a source of uncertainty for studying
laboratory hypernuclei and neutron star observations. In this work, we perform
Bayesian inference of phenomenological hyperon-nucleon interactions using the
tidal-deformability measurement of the GW170817 binary neutron star merger as
detected by LIGO/Virgo and the mass-radius measurements of PSR J0030+0541 and
PSR J0740+6620 as detected by NICER. The analysis is based on a set of stiff
relativistic neutron-star-matter equation of states with hyperons from the
relativistic mean-field theory, naturally fulfilling the causality requirement
and empirical nuclear matter properties. We specifically utilize the strong
correlation recently deduced between the scalar and vector meson hyperon
couplings, imposed by the measured $\Lambda$ separation energy in
single-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei, and perform four different tests with or without
the strong correlation. We find that the laboratory hypernuclear constraint
ensures a large enough $\Lambda$-scalar-meson coupling to match the large
vector coupling in hyperon star matter. When adopting the current most probable
intervals of hyperon couplings from the joint analysis of laboratory and
astrophysical data, we find the maximum mass of hyperon stars is at most
$2.176^{+0.085}_{-0.202}M_{\odot}$ ($68\%$ credible interval) from the chosen
set of stiff equation of states. The reduction of the stellar radius due to
hyperons is quantified based on our analysis and various hyperon star
properties are provided.

Title:Identification and Properties of Isolated Field Elliptical Galaxies from CFHTLS-W1,"
Abstract:  We present a catalogue of isolated field elliptical (IfE) galaxies drawn from
the W1 field of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). 228
IfEs were identified from a flux-limited (r<21.8) galaxy catalogue which
corresponds to a density of 3 IfE/sq.deg. For comparison we consider a sample
of elliptical galaxies living in dense environments, based on identification of
the brightest cluster galaxies (BGCs) in the same survey. Using the same
dataset for the comparison sample ensures a uniform selection, including in the
redshift range as IfEs (i.e. 0.1 < z < 0.9). A comparison of elliptical
galaxies in different environments reveals that IfEs and BCGs have similar
behaviours in their colours, star formation activities, and scaling relations
of mass-size and size-luminosity. IfEs and BCGs have similar slopes in the
scaling relations with respect to cluster ellipticals within the $-24 \leq
M_{r} \leq -22$ magnitude and $10.2< \textrm{log}( \textrm M_{*}/ \textrm
M_\odot)\leq12.0$ mass ranges. Three IfEs identified in this study can be
associated with fossil groups found in the same survey area which gives clues
for future studies.

Abstract:  We observe the brightest member of the Praesepe cluster, Epsilon Cancri, to
precisely measure the characteristics of the stars in this binary system, en
route to a new measurement of the cluster's age. We present spectroscopic
radial velocity measurements and interferometric observations of the
sky-projected orbit to derive the masses, which we find to be M_1/M_sun = 2.420
+/- 0.008 and M_2/M_sun = 2.226 +/- 0.004. We place limits on the
color-magnitude positions of the stars by using spectroscopic and
interferometric luminosity ratios while trying to reproduce the spectral energy
distribution of Epsilon Cancri. We re-examine the cluster membership of stars
at the bright end of the color-magnitude diagram using Gaia data and literature
radial velocity information. The binary star data are consistent with an age of
637 +/- 19 Myr, as determined from MIST model isochrones. The masses and
luminosities of the stars appear to select models with the most commonly used
amount of convective core overshooting.

Title:Formation of Mass-gap Black Holes from Neutron Star X-ray Binaries with Super-Eddington Accretion,"
Abstract:  Electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations indicate that there is
dearth of compact objects with mass $\sim 2.5-5~{\rm M_\odot}$. This so-called
""mass gap"" may be linked to the supernova explosion mechanisms that produce
neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). However, the existence of a few
mass-gap compact objects, some of which have been confirmed to be BHs, poses a
challenge to the traditional theory of black hole formation. In this work we
investigate the possible formation channel of BHs from accretion-induced
collapse (AIC) of NSs in X-ray binaries. In particular, we consider the
influence of super-Eddington accretion of NSs. Recent observations of
ultraluminous X-ray pulsars suggest that their apparent luminosities may
reflect the true accretion luminosities of the accreting NSs, even exceeding
the Eddington limit by a factor of $\gtrsim 100$. Thus, NSs accreting at a
super-Eddington accretion rate may rapidly grow into BHs in
intermediate/low-mass X-ray binaries. Based on the super-Eddington accretion
disk models, we have investigated the evolution of NSs in intermediate/low-mass
X-ray binaries by combining binary population synthesis and detailed stellar
evolutionary calculations. We show that super-Eddington accretion plays a
critical role in mass growth of NSs, and the final masses of the descendant BHs
are heavily dependent on the NS magnetic fields, the metallicity of the donor
star, and the bifurcation period of the binaries. AIC of NSs may account for
some of the observed mass-gap BHs like GRO J0422+32. We also present the
parameter distributions of the potential mass-gap BHs in a Milky Way-like
galaxy, and point out that future space-based gravitational wave observations
may provide important test of or constraints on the formation of mass-gap BHs
from the AIC channel.

Title:Galaxy morphoto-Z with neural Networks (GaZNets). I. Optimized accuracy and outlier fraction from Imaging and Photometry,"
Abstract:  In the era of large sky surveys, photometric redshifts (photo-z) represent
crucial information for galaxy evolution and cosmology studies. In this work,
we propose a new Machine Learning (ML) tool called Galaxy morphoto-Z with
neural Networks (GaZNet-1), which uses both images and multi-band photometry
measurements to predict galaxy redshifts, with accuracy, precision and outlier
fraction superior to standard methods based on photometry only. As a first
application of this tool, we estimate photo-z of a sample of galaxies in the
Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). GaZNet-1 is trained and tested on $\sim140 000$
galaxies collected from KiDS Data Release 4 (DR4), for which spectroscopic
redshifts are available from different surveys. This sample is dominated by
bright (MAG$\_$AUTO$<21$) and low redshift ($z < 0.8$) systems, however, we
could use $\sim$ 6500 galaxies in the range $0.8 < z < 3$ to effectively extend
the training to higher redshift. The inputs are the r-band galaxy images plus
the 9-band magnitudes and colours, from the combined catalogs of optical
photometry from KiDS and near-infrared photometry from the VISTA Kilo-degree
Infrared survey. By combining the images and catalogs, GaZNet-1 can achieve
extremely high precision in normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD=0.014
for lower redshift and NMAD=0.041 for higher redshift galaxies) and low
fraction of outliers ($0.4$\% for lower and $1.27$\% for higher redshift
galaxies). Compared to ML codes using only photometry as input, GaZNet-1 also
shows a $\sim 10-35$% improvement in precision at different redshifts and a
$\sim$ 45% reduction in the fraction of outliers. We finally discuss that, by
correctly separating galaxies from stars and active galactic nuclei, the
overall photo-z outlier fraction of galaxies can be cut down to $0.3$\%.

Title:The Hubble PanCET Program: A Featureless Transmission Spectrum for WASP-29b and Evidence of Enhanced Atmospheric Metallicity on WASP-80b,"
Abstract:  We present a uniform analysis of transit observations from the Hubble Space
Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope of two warm gas giants orbiting K-type
stars - WASP-29b and WASP-80b. The transmission spectra, which span 0.4-5.0
$\mu$m, are interpreted using a suite of chemical equilibrium PLATON
atmospheric retrievals. Both planets show evidence of significant aerosol
opacity along the day-night terminator. The spectrum of WASP-29b is flat
throughout the visible and near-infrared, suggesting the presence of condensate
clouds extending to low pressures. The lack of spectral features hinders our
ability to constrain the atmospheric metallicity and C/O ratio. In contrast,
WASP-80b shows a discernible, albeit muted H$_2$O absorption feature at 1.4
$\mu$m, as well as a steep optical spectral slope that is caused by
fine-particle aerosols and/or contamination from unocculted spots on the
variable host star. WASP-80b joins the small number of gas-giant exoplanets
that show evidence for enhanced atmospheric metallicity: the transmission
spectrum is consistent with metallicities ranging from $\sim$30-100 times solar
in the case of cloudy limbs to a few hundred times solar in the cloud-free
scenario. In addition to the detection of water, we infer the presence of
CO$_2$ in the atmosphere of WASP-80b based on the enhanced transit depth in the
Spitzer 4.5 $\mu$m bandpass. From a complementary analysis of Spitzer secondary
eclipses, we find that the dayside emission from WASP-29b and WASP-80b is
consistent with brightness temperatures of $937 \pm 48$ and $851 \pm 14$ K,
respectively, indicating relatively weak day-night heat transport and low Bond
albedo.

Abstract:  Multi-messenger astronomy is becoming a major avenue to explore the Universe.
Several well known astrophysical sources are also expected to emit other
'messenger' than photons: namely cosmic rays, gravitational waves and
neutrinos. These additional messengers bring complementary pieces of
information to the ones carried by electromagnetic radiation and concur to draw
a complete phenomenological picture of several astrophysical events as well as
to measure key cosmological parameters. Indeed, it is widely believed in the
astronomical community that several aspects of fundamental physics and
cosmology will be unveiled only within the framework of multi-messenger
astronomy. The most recent breakthrough discoveries of a gravitational wave
source associated with a short gamma-ray burst, and of a neutrino event found
to be spatially consistent with a flaring blazar, have already shown the key
role that high-energy sources will play in multi-messenger observations. The
first part of this chapter provides a description of the main properties of
gamma-ray bursts, blazars, and other high-energy sources from which we expect
to detect gravitational waves and/or neutrinos in the next years, and the
achievements that will be reached from multi-messenger observations. The second

that will play a crucial role in multi-messenger observational campaigns. More
specifically, we provide an overview of current and next generation
ground-based gravitational wave interferometers and neutrino telescopes, as
well as the major X-ray and gamma-ray observatories that will be crucial for

Abstract:  In this Paper we consider a problem of formation and evolution of orbital
parameters of a binary primordial black hole (PBH) due to gravitational
interaction with clustering cold dark matter (CDM). Mass and initial separation
have values, which are appropriate for the problem of explanation of the
LIGO/Virgo events by coalescing binary PBHs. We consider both radiation
dominated and CDM dominated stages of the evolution using numerical and
semi-analytical means. We show that at the end time of our numerical
simulations binary's semimajor axis decreases by approximately one hundred
times, while its angular momentum decreases by ten times, in comparison to the
standard values, which do not take into account effects associated with CDM
clustering. We check that our conclusions are hardly affected by numerical
artefacts. We estimate the merger rate of binary PBHs due to emission of
gravitational wave at the present time both in the standard case when the
effects associated with clustering are neglected and in the case when they are
taken into account and show, that these effects could increase the merger rate
at least by $6-8$ times in comparison to the standard estimate. This, in turn,
means, that a mass fraction of PBHs, $f$, should be smaller than it was assumed
before.

Title:Prevalence of Thermal Non-Equilibrium over an Active Region,"
Abstract:  Recent observations have shown that besides the characteristic multi-million
degree component the corona also contains a large amount of cool material
called coronal rain, whose clumps are 10 - 100 times cooler and denser than the
surroundings and are often organised in larger events termed showers. Thermal
instability (TI) within a coronal loop in a state of thermal non-equilibrium
(TNE) is the leading mechanism behind the formation of coronal rain but no
investigation on showers exists to date. In this study, we conduct a
morphological and thermodynamic multi-wavelength study of coronal rain showers
observed in an active region (AR) off-limb with IRIS and SDO, spanning
chromospheric to transition region and coronal temperatures. Rain showers were
found to be widespread across the AR over the 5.45-hour observing time, with
average length, width and duration of 27.37$\pm$11.95 Mm, 2.14$\pm$0.74 Mm, and
35.22$\pm$20.35 min, respectively. We find a good correspondence between
showers and the cooling coronal structures consistent with the TNE-TI scenario,
thereby properly identifying coronal loops in the 'coronal veil', including the
strong expansion at low heights and an almost zero expansion in the corona.
This agrees with previous work suggesting that the observed zero expansion in
the EUV is due to specific cross-field temperature distribution. We estimate
the total number of showers to be 155$\pm$40, leading to a TNE volume of
4.56$\pm$3.71 $\times$ $10^{28}$cm$^{3}$, i.e. on the same order of the AR
volume. This suggests a prevalence of TNE over the AR indicating strongly
stratified and high-frequency heating on average.

Title:Three new brown dwarfs and a massive hot Jupiter revealed by TESS around early-type stars,"
Abstract:  The detection and characterization of exoplanets and brown dwarfs (BDs)
around massive AF-type stars is essential to investigate and constrain the
impact of stellar mass on planet properties. However, such targets are still
poorly explored in radial velocity (RV) surveys because they only feature a
small number of stellar lines and those are usually broadened and blended by
stellar rotation as well as stellar jitter. As a result, the available
information about the formation and evolution of planets and BDs around hot
stars is limited. We aim to increase the sample and precisely measure the
masses and eccentricities of giant planets and BDs transiting AF-type stars
detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We followed
bright (V < 12 mag) stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ > 6200 K that host giant
companions (R > 7 $\mathrm{R_{\rm \oplus}}$) using ground-based photometric
observations as well as high precision RV measurements from the CORALIE,
CHIRON, TRES, FEROS, and MINERVA-Australis spectrographs. In the context, we
present the discovery of three BD companions, TOI-629b, TOI-1982b, and
TOI-2543b, and one massive planet, TOI-1107b. From the joint analysis we find
the BDs have masses between 66 and 68 $\mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$, periods between
7.54 and 17.17 days, and radii between 0.95 and 1.11 $\mathrm{R_{\rm Jup}}$.
The hot Jupiter TOI-1107b has an orbital period of 4.08 days, a radius of 1.30
$\mathrm{R_{\rm Jup}}$, and a mass of 3.35 $\mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$. As a
by-product of this program, we identified four low-mass eclipsing components

This is primarily because they are able to induce the same phase ramp

Title:Improving cosmological covariance matrices with machine learning,"
Abstract:  Cosmological covariance matrices are fundamental for parameter inference,
since they are responsible for propagating uncertainties from the data down to
the model parameters. However, when data vectors are large, in order to
estimate accurate and precise matrices we need huge numbers of observations, or
rather costly simulations - neither of which may be viable. In this work we
propose a machine learning approach to alleviate this problem in the context of
the matrices used in the study of large-scale structure. With only a small
amount of data (matrices built with samples of 50-200 halo power spectra) we
are able to provide significantly improved matrices, which are almost
indistinguishable from the ones built from much larger samples (thousands of
spectra). In order to perform this task we trained convolutional neural
networks to denoise the matrices, using in the training process a data set made
up entirely of spectra extracted from simple, inexpensive halo simulations
(mocks). We then show that the method not only removes the noise in the
matrices of the cheap simulation, but it is also able to successfully denoise
the matrices of halo power spectra from N-body simulations. We compare the
denoised to the other matrices using several metrics, and in all of them they
score better, without any signs of spurious artifacts. With the help of the
Wishart distribution we derive an analytical extrapolation for the effective
sample augmentation allowed by the denoiser. Finally, we show that, by using
the denoised matrices, the cosmological parameters can be recovered with nearly
the same accuracy as when using matrices built with a sample of 30,000 spectra
in the case of the cheap simulations, and with 15,000 spectra in the case of
the N-body simulations. Of particular interest is the bias in the Hubble
parameter $H_0$, which was significantly reduced after applying the denoiser.

Title:Moon and background removal algorithm for all-sky imager,"
Abstract:  All-sky imagers (ASIs) are used to record auroral activities from the ground
but are often contaminated by the moon. Here, we studied the THEMIS ASIs data
and developed an algorithm to eliminate the moon which can be generalized to
other types of ASIs. With our algorithm, the ASI pixels within the moon's
surface are typically saturated and thus removed by the algorithm. The ASI
pixels within the moon's glow are close to but not saturated and thus can be
calibrated by the algorithm to recover auroral structures within the glow. For
pixels far away from the moon or when there is no moon, the algorithm preserves
typical auroral forms, from the transient features of auroral streamers and
pulsating aurora to more stable features of pre-onset arcs. Note that the
algorithm does not treat clouds, which is a known limitation.

Title:Improved model of X-ray emission from hot accretion flows,"
Abstract:  We have developed an improved model of X-ray emission from optically thin,
two-temperature accretion flows, \texttt{kerrflow}, using an exact Monte Carlo
treatment of global Comptonization as well as with a fully general relativistic
description of both the radiative and hydrodynamic processes. It also includes
pion-decay electrons, whose synchrotron emission dominates the seed photons
yield at high accretion rates in flows around supermassive black holes. We
consider in detail the dependence of the model spectra on the black hole spin,
the electron heating efficiency, the plasma magnetization and the accretion
rate, and we discuss feasibility of constraining these parameters by analyzing
X-ray spectra of nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. We note some
degeneracies which hinder precise estimations of these parameters when
individual X-ray spectra are analyzed. These degeneracies are eliminated when
several spectra from a given source are fitted jointly, which then allows us to
reliably measure the model parameters. We find significant differences with
previous spectral models of hot-flow emission, related with the computational
methods for Comptonization. Finally, we briefly consider and discuss the
dependence on the viscosity parameter and on the outflow strength.

Title:Modelling the secular evolution of proto-planetary disc dust sizes -- A comparison between the viscous and magnetic wind case,"
Abstract:  For many years proto-planetary discs have been thought to evolve viscously:
angular momentum redistribution leads to accretion and outward disc spreading.
Recently, the hypothesis that accretion is due, instead, to angular momentum
removal by magnetic winds gained new popularity: no disc spreading is expected
in this case. In this paper, we run several one-dimensional gas and dust
simulations to make predictions on the time-evolution of disc sizes \textit{in
the dust} and to assess whether they can be used to understand how discs
evolve. We show that viscous and magnetic wind models have very different dust
disc radii. In particular, MHD wind models are compact and their sizes either
remain constant or decrease with time. On the contrary, discs become larger
with time in the viscous case (when $\alpha\gtrsim10^{-3}$). Although current
observations lack enough sensitivity to discriminate between these two
scenarios, higher-sensitivity surveys could be fruitful to this goal on a
$1\,{\rm to}\,10\,{\rm Myr}$ age range. When compared with the available ALMA
Band~7 data, both viscous and magnetic wind models are compatible with the
observationally-inferred dust radii in Lupus, Chamaeleon~I and Upper Sco.
Furthermore, in the drift-dominated regime, the size-luminosity correlation is
reproduced in Lupus, both in Band~7 and 3, while in Upper Sco a different slope
than in the data is predicted. Sub-structures (potentially undetected) can
explain several outliers with large observed sizes. Higher-angular-resolution
observations will be helpful to test our predictions in the case of more
compact discs, expected in both frameworks, particularly at the age of Upper
Sco.

Title:Venus as an Exoplanet: I. An Initial Exploration of the 3-D Energy Balance for a CO$_{2}$ Exoplanetary Atmosphere Around an M-Dwarf Star,"
Abstract:  The chemical evolution of an exoplanetary Venus-like atmosphere is dependent
upon the ultraviolet to near ultraviolet (FUV-NUV) radiation ratio from the
parent star, the balance between CO$_{2}$ photolysis and recombination via
reactions that depend on the water abundance, and various catalytic chemical
cycles. In this study, we use a three-dimensional (3-D) model to simulate
conditions for a Venus-like exoplanet orbiting the M-dwarf type star GJ 436 by
varying the star/planet distance and considering the resultant effects on
heating/cooling and dynamics. The simulation includes the middle and upper
atmosphere (<40 mbar). Overall, these model comparisons reveal that the impact
of extreme ultraviolet to ultraviolet (EUV-UV) heating on the energy balance
shows both radiative and dynamical processes are responsible for driving
significant variations in zonal winds and global temperature profiles at <
10$^{-5}$ mbar. More specifically, CO$_{2}$ 15-${\mu}$m cooling balances EUV/UV
and Near InfraRed (NIR) heating at altitudes below 10$^{-7}$ mbar pressure with
a strong maximum balance for pressures at ~10$^{-5}$ mbar, thus explaining the
invariance of the temperature distribution at altitudes below 10$^{-5}$mbar
pressure for all cases. Our model comparisons also show that moderate changes
in NIR heating result in relatively small changes in neutral temperature in the
upper atmosphere, and virtually no change in the middle atmosphere. However,
with larger changes in the NIR heating profile, much greater changes in neutral
temperature occur in the entire upper and middle atmosphere studied.

Title:Type IIP supernova SN 2016X in radio frequencies,"
Abstract:  Context: The study of radio emission from core-collapse supernovae (SNe)
probes the interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar medium (CSM) and
reveals details of the mass-loss history of the progenitor. Aims: We report
observations of the type IIP supernova SN\,2016X during the plateau phase, at
ages between 21 and 75 days, obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA) radio observatory. Methods: We modelled the radio spectra as
self-absorbed synchrotron emission, and we characterised the shockwave and the
mass-loss rate of the progenitor. We also combined our results with previously
reported X-ray observations to verify the energy equipartition assumption.
Results: The properties of the shockwave are comparable to other type IIP
supernovae. The shockwave expands according to a self-similar law $R \propto
t^m$ with $m=0.76 \pm 0.08$, which is notably different from a constant
expansion. The corresponding shock velocities are approximately 10700 - 8000 km
s$^{-1}$ during the time of our observations. The constant mass-loss rate of
the progenitor is $\dot{M}=$ (7.8 $\pm$ 0.9)\,$\times 10^{-7} \alpha^{-8/19}
(\epsilon_B/0.1)^{-1} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, for an assumed wind velocity of 10
km s$^{-1}$. We observe spectral steepening in the optically thin regime at the
earlier epochs, and we demonstrate that it is caused by electron cooling via
the inverse Compton effect. We show that the shockwave is characterised by a
moderate deviation from energy equipartition by a factor of $\epsilon_e /
\epsilon_B \approx 28$, being the second type IIP supernova to show such a
feature.

Abstract:  We present a precise thermometry system to monitor room-temperature
components of a telescope for radio-astronomy such as cosmic microwave

Title:Feeding post core collapse supernova explosion jets with an inflated main sequence companion,"
Abstract:  We simulate the response of a main sequence star to the explosion of a
stripped-envelope (type Ib or Ic) core collapse supernova (CCSN) when the main
sequence star orbits the core at a distance of 10-20Ro at explosion. We use the
stellar evolution code MESA to follow the response of main sequence stars of
masses 3Mo and 7Mo to energy deposition and mass removal. The collision of the
CCSN ejecta with the main sequence star deposits energy and inflate the main
sequence star. If the binary system stays bound after the CCSN explosion the
inflated main sequence star might engulf the newly born neutron star (NS). We
assume that the NS accretes mass through an accretion disk and launches jets.
The jets remove mass from the inflated main sequence star and collide with the
CCSN ejecta. Although this scenario is rare, it adds up to other rare scenarios
to further support the notion that many stripped envelope CCSNe are powered by
late jets. The late jets can power these CCSNe-I for a long time and might
power bumps in their lightcurve. The jets might also shape the inner ejecta to
a bipolar morphology. Our results further support suggestions that there are
several ways to feed a NS (or a black hole) to launch the late jets in
superluminous supernovae.

Title:The Ages of Optically Bright Sub-Clusters in the Serpens Star-Forming Region,"
Abstract:  The Serpens Molecular Cloud is one of the most active star-forming regions
within 500 pc, with over one thousand of YSOs at different evolutionary stages.
The ages of the member stars inform us about the star formation history of the
cloud. In this paper, we develop a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting
method for nearby evolved (diskless) young stars from members of the Pleiades
to estimate their ages, with a temperature scale adopted from APOGEE spectra.
When compared with literature temperatures of selected YSOs in Orion, the SED
fits to cool (<5000 K) stars have temperatures that differ by an average of <~
50 K and have a scatter of ~ 210 K for both disk-hosting and diskless stars. We
then apply this method to YSOs in the Serpens Molecular Cloud to estimate ages
of optical members previously identified from Gaia DR2 astrometry data. The
optical members in Serpens are concentrated in different subgroups with ages
from ~4 Myr to ~22 Myr; the youngest clusters, W40 and Serpens South, are dusty
regions that lack enough optical members to be included in this analysis. These
ages establish that the Serpens Molecular Cloud has been forming stars for much
longer than has been inferred from infrared surveys.

Title:Accounting for stellar activity signals in radial-velocity data by using Change Point Detection techniques,"
Abstract:  Active regions on the photosphere of a star have been the major obstacle for
detecting Earth-like exoplanets using the radial velocity (RV) method. A
commonly employed solution for addressing stellar activity is to assume a
linear relationship between the RV observations and the activity indicators
along the entire time series, and then remove the estimated contribution of
activity from the variation in RV data (overall correction method). However,
since active regions evolve on the photosphere over time, correlations between
the RV observations and the activity indicators will correspondingly be
anisotropic. We present an approach that recognizes the RV locations where the
correlations between the RV and the activity indicators significantly change in
order to better account for variations in RV caused by stellar activity. The
proposed approach uses a general family of statistical breakpoint methods,
often referred to as change point detection (CPD) algorithms; several
implementations of which are available in R and python. A thorough comparison
is made between the breakpoint-based approach and the overall correction
method. To ensure wide representativity, we use measurements from real stars
that have different levels of stellar activity and whose spectra have different
signal-to-noise ratios. When the corrections for stellar activity are applied
separately to each temporal segment identified by the breakpoint method, the
corresponding residuals in the RV time series are typically much smaller than
those obtained by the overall correction method. Consequently, the generalized
Lomb-Scargle periodogram contains a smaller number of peaks caused by active
regions. The CPD algorithm is particularly effective when focusing on active
stars with long time series, such as alpha Cen B.

Title:A Radio Continuum Study of NGC 2082,"
Abstract:  We present radio continuum observations of NGC 2082 using ASKAP, ATCA and
Parkes telescopes from 888 MHz to 9000 MHz. Some 20 arcsec from the centre of
this nearby spiral galaxy, we discovered a bright and compact radio source,
J054149.24-641813.7, of unknown origin. To constrain the nature of
J054149.24-641813.7, we searched for transient events with the Ultra-Wideband
Low Parkes receiver, and compare its luminosity and spectral index to various
nearby supernova remnants (SNRs), and fast radio burst (FRB) local
environments. Its radio spectral index is flat (${\alpha} = 0.02 \pm 0.09$)
which is unlikely to be either an SNR or pulsar. No transient events were
detected with the Parkes telescope over three days of observations, and our
calculations show J054149.24-641813.7 is two orders of magnitude less luminous
than the persistent radio sources associated with FRB 121102 & 190520B. We find
that the probability of finding such a source behind NGC 2082 is P = 1.2%, and
conclude that the most likely origin for J054149.24-641813.7 is a background
quasar or radio galaxy.

Title:The need for a public forecast of stellar activity to optimise exoplanet radial velocity detections & transmission spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  Advances in high-precision spectrographs have paved the way for the search
for an Earth analogue orbiting a Sun-like star within its habitable zone.
However, the research community remains limited by the presence of stellar
noise produced by stellar magnetic activity. These activity phenomena can
obscure the detection of Earth-mass exoplanets and can create parasitic signals
in transmission spectra. In this paper, we outline the need for a public
forecast of stellar activity, and produce a proof of principle. Using publicly
available spectra we are able to forecast stellar minima several years ahead
and reach a typical uncertainty on the timing of these minima of ~0.5 year,
similar to the precision reached on our own Sun's magnetic cycle. Furthermore,
we use our toy model to show that knowing when to observe can improve the
sensitivity of HARPS-North's Solar telescope to low mass planets by up to an
order of magnitude, and we show that the majority of exoplanets selected for
Early Release Science and Guaranteed Time Observations on the James Webb will
be observed close or during stellar maxima, incurring a higher risk of stellar
contamination. We finish our paper by outlining a number of next steps to
create a public forecast usable by teams around the globe, by telescope time
allocation committees, and in preparation for spacecrafts such as Ariel.

"Title:Apsidal motion in massive eccentric binaries: The case of CPD-41$^\circ$7742, and HD 152218 revisited","
Abstract:  This paper is part of a study of the apsidal motion in close eccentric
massive binary systems, which aims to constrain the internal structure of the
stars. We focus on the binary CPD-417742 and revisit HD152218.
Independent studies of CPD-417742 in the past showed large discrepancies
in the longitude of periastron of the orbit, hinting at the presence of apsidal
motion. We perform a consistent analysis of all observational data, explicitly
accounting for the apsidal motion. We use spectroscopic and photometric
observations of CPD-417742 to infer values for the fundamental stellar
and binary parameters. We apply a disentangling method to the spectra to
simultaneously derive the RVs at the times of observation and reconstruct the
individual stellar spectra. These are analysed by means of CMFGEN to determine
the stellar properties. We determine the apsidal motion rate in two ways: We
complement our RVs with those reported in the literature and we use the phase
shifts between the primary and secondary eclipses. The light curves are
analysed by means of Nightfall to constrain the orbital inclination and stellar
masses. Stellar structure and evolution models are constructed with Cles.
Different prescriptions for the mixing are adopted. Photometric data of
HD152218 are analysed and stellar evolution models are built. The binary
CPD-417742 displays apsidal motion at a rate of 15.38+0.42-0.51
yr-1. Our analysis of the observational data of CPD-417742 explicitly
accounting for the apsidal motion allows us to explain the discrepancy in
periastron longitudes. The age estimates are in good agreement with estimates
obtained for other massive binaries in NGC 6231. This study confirms the need
for enhanced mixing in the stellar evolution models to reproduce the
observational stellar properties; this points towards larger convective cores
than usually considered.

Title:Magnetically-gated accretion model: application to short bursts in the intermediate polar V1223 Sgr,"
Abstract:  Some intermediate polars show outbursts that are much shorter than those
observed in normal dwarf novae, and whose origin has remained unelucidated for
a long time. We examine here the case of V1223 Sgr, an intermediate polar that
showed a short outburst in 1984, and compare the outburst characteristics with
the predictions of the magnetospheric gating model. We use the archival data
from the AAVSO from which we extract the outburst profiles. We use our code for
computing the time-dependent evolution of an accretion disc truncated by the
white dwarf magnetic field, using a simple description of the interaction
between the disc and the magnetic field, as in D'Antona and Spruit (2010). We
find that V1223 Sgr underwent a series of short outbursts, with a rise lasting
for typically two to three hours, and a slightly longer decay. When applied to
intermediate polars, the model by D'Antona and Spruit (2010) accounts well for
the observed outburst duration and intensity. We confirm, however, that the
model outcome depends sensitively on the rather poorly constrained model's
assumptions. We have also searched the AAVSO database for short outbursts in
other IPs, identifying individual short outbursts in FO Aqr, TV Col, NY Lup and
EI UMa, but no series as those observed in V1223 Sgr. We also found a
superoutburst, followed by a reflare in CTCV J2056-3014. Although the
magnetic-gating accretion instability model is clearly responsible for the
series of V1223 Sgr short outbursts and most probably for similar events in
other intermediate polars, the model describing this process needs improving,
in particular concerning the interaction of the white-dwarf's magnetic field
with the accretion disc. This difficult task might benefit from further
comparison of the model outcome with additional observations having good time
coverage and time resolution.

Title:Dynamical essence of the eccentric von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effect in restricted hierarchical planetary systems,"
Abstract:  Aim. The eccentric von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect is widely used to
explain dynamical phenomena in varieties of astrophysical systems. The purpose
of this work is to make clear the dynamical essence of the eccentric ZLK effect
by constructing an inherent connection between such an effect and dynamics of
secular resonance in restricted hierarchical planetary systems. Methods.
Dynamical structures of apsidal resonance are analytically studied by means of
perturbative treatments. The resonant model is formulated by averaging the
Hamiltonian (up to octupole order) over rotating ZLK cycles, producing an
additional motion integral. The phase portraits under the resonant model can be
used to analyse dynamical structures, including resonant centres, dynamical
separatrices and islands of libration. Results. By analysing phase portraits,
five branches of libration centres and eight libration zones are found in the
eccentricity--inclination space. There is an excellent agreement between
analytical results of libration zone and numerical distributions of resonant
orbit, indicating that the resonant model for apsidal resonances is valid and
applicable. Additionally, it is found that, in the test-particle limit,
distributions of flipping orbits are dominated by those apsidal resonances
centred at the inclination of i = 90 deg. Conclusions. The eccentric ZLK effect
is dynamically equivalent to the effect of apsidal resonance in restricted
hierarchical planetary systems. The dynamical response of the eccentric ZLK
effect (or effect of apsidal resonance) is to significantly excite
eccentricities and/or inclinations of test particles in the very long-term
evolution.

Title:Observable characteristics of the charged black hole surrounded by thin disk accretion in Rastall gravity,"
Abstract:  The observable characteristics of the charged black hole (BH) surrounded by a
thin disk accretion are investigated in the Rastall gravity. We found that the
radii of the direct emission, lensing ring, and photon ring dramatically
increased as the radiation field parameter increases, but they only weakly
depend on the BH charge. Three positions of the radiation accretion disk
relative to the BH are considered, i.e., the innermost accretion disk is closed
to the radii of the innermost stable circular orbit, the photon ring of the BH,
and the event horizon of the BH. The observed images in three cases
respectively are obtained. It is found that the total observed flux is
dominated by the direct emission, the lensing ring provides a small
contribution, and the photon ring is negligible. The lensing and photon rings
could not be observed in the blurred image with the EHT resolution. Our results
suggest that the observable characteristics of the charged BH surrounded by the
thin disk accretion in the Rastall gravity depend on both the BH space-time
structure and the position of the radiating accretion disk with respect to the
BH. The research of these BH images may serve as a probe for the BH-disk
structure in M87$^{*}$ like nearby active galactic nuclei.

Title:Particle deposition on the saturnian satellites from ephemeral cryovolcanism on Enceladus,"
Abstract:  The geologically active south pole of Enceladus generates a plume of
micron-sized particles, which likely form Saturn's tenuous E-ring extending
from the orbit of Mimas to Titan. Interactions between these particles and
satellites have been suggested, though only as very thin surficial phenomena.
We scrutinize high-resolution images with a newly developed numerical shape
model of Helene and find that the leading hemisphere of Helene is covered by
thick deposits of E-ring particles, which occasionally collapse to form
gully-like depressions. The depths of the resultant gullies and near-absence of
small craters on the leading hemisphere indicate that the deposit is tens to
hundreds of meters thick. The ages of the deposits are less than several tens
of My, which coincides well with similar deposits found on Telesto and Calypso.
Our findings as well as previous theoretical work collectively indicate that
the cryovolcanic activity currently occurring on Enceladus is ephemeral.

Abstract:  Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences provide an
independent probe of the cosmic expansion history other than electromagnetic
waves. In this work, we assume the binary black holes (BBHs) detected by
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaborations are of primordial origin and constrain
the population parameters of primordial black holes (PBHs) and Hubble parameter
$H(z)$ using $42$ BBHs from third LVK GW transient catalog (GWTC-3). Three PBH
mass models are considered: lognormal, power-law, and critical collapse PBH
mass functions. By performing a hierarchical Bayesian population analysis, the
Bayes factor strongly disfavors the power-law PBH mass function for the other
two in GWTC-3. The constraints on standard $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ cosmological
parameters are rather weak and in agreement with current results. When
combining the multi-messenger standard siren measurement from GW170817, the
Hubble constant $H_0$ is constrained to be $69^{+19}_{-8}\, \mathrm{km}\,
\mathrm{s}^{-1}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $70^{+26}_{-8}\, \mathrm{km}\,
\mathrm{s}^{-1}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at $68\%$ confidence for the lognormal and
critical collapse mass functions, respectively. Our results are comparable with
those assuming the phenomenological mass models inspired by the astrophysical

Title:Subarcsecond view on the high-redshift blazar GB 1508+5714 by the International LOFAR Telescope,"
Abstract:  Studies of the most distant AGNs allow us to test our current understanding
of the physics present in radio-jetted AGNs across a range of environments. The
decrease in apparent luminosity with distance is the primary difficulty to
overcome in the study of these distant AGNs, which requires highly sensitive
instruments. Our goal is to employ new long wavelength radio data to better
parametrise the broad-band SED of GB 1508+5714, a high-redshift (z=4.30) AGN.
Its high redshift, high intrinsic luminosity, and classification as a blazar
allow us to test emission models that consider the efficient cooling of jet
electrons via inverse Compton losses in interactions with the dense CMB photon
field at high redshifts. A significant detection of this effect in GB 1508+5714
may partly explain the apparent sparsity of high-redshift radio galaxies in
wide-field surveys; detections of this kind are only becoming possible with the
current generation of SKA precursors. We used international LOFAR telescope to
image the long wavelength radio emission around the high-redshift blazar GB
1508+5714 on arcsecond scales at frequencies between 128 MHz and 160 MHz. This
allowed us to compare the spatially resolved structure with higher frequency
observations, and to construct spectral index maps. The LOFAR image shows a
compact unresolved core and two resolved emission regions around 2 arcsec to
the east and to the west of the radio core. We find structure consistent with
previous VLA observations, as well as a previously unreported emission region
to the east. We interpret the arcsecond-scale radio structure of GB 1508+5714
as a FR II-like radio galaxy at a small viewing angle. Our SED modelling shows
that a scenario featuring significant quenching effects caused by interaction
with the CMB provides a good description of the data, and notably explains the
suppressed radio emission.

"Title:Note on fundamental physics tests from black hole imaging: Comment on ""Hunting for extra dimensions in the shadow of Sagittarius A$^*$""","
Abstract:  Several works over the past years have discussed the possibility of testing
fundamental physics using Very Long Baseline Interferometry horizon-scale black
hole (BH) images, such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of M87$^*$

from circularity $\Delta \mathcal{C}$ of the BH shadow. For the case of the EHT
image of Sgr A$^*$, limits on $\Delta \mathcal{C}$ are not available due to the
sparse interferometric coverage of the 2017 observations, alongside the short
variability timescale of Sgr A$^*$ compared to M87$^*$. Concerning this point,
we comment on the results of a recent preprint which purports to have derived
new limits on extra dimensions using the deviation from circularity of Sgr
A$^*$'s shadow. The latter is quoted to be $\lesssim 10\%$ as with M87$^*$,
based on the ""similarity"" of the two shadows: however, this is an incorrect
assumption, invalidating the subsequent results. In the immediate future, the
simplest tests of fundamental physics from Sgr A$^*$'s image will therefore
mostly have to rely on $r_{\rm sh}$, whereas additional observables such as the
photon ring and azimuthal angle lapse should soon be available and allow for
novel tests.

Title:Tracing Lyman-alpha and Lyman Continuum Escape in Galaxies with Mg II Emission,"
Abstract:  Star-forming galaxies are considered the likeliest source of the H I ionizing
Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons that reionized the intergalactic medium at high
redshifts. However, above z >~ 6, the neutral intergalactic medium prevents
direct observations of LyC. Therefore, recent years have seen the development
of indirect indicators for LyC that can be calibrated at lower redshifts and
applied in the Epoch of Reionization. Emission from Mg II \ly\ly 2796, 2803
doublet has been proposed as a promising LyC proxy. In this paper, we present
new Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations for 8 LyC
emitter candidates, selected to have strong Mg II emission lines. We securely
detect LyC emission in 50% (4/8) galaxies with 2$\sigma$ significance. This
high detection rate suggests that strong Mg II emitters might be more likely to
leak LyC than similar galaxies without strong Mg II. Using photoionization
models, we constrain the escape fraction of Mg II as ~ 15 -- 60%. We confirm
that the escape fraction of Mg II correlates tightly with that of Lyman-alpha
(LyA), which we interpret as an indication that the escape fraction of both
species is controlled by resonant scattering in the same low column density
gas. Furthermore, we show that the combination of the Mg II emission and dust
attenuation can be used to estimate the escape fraction of LyC statistically.
These findings confirm that Mg II emission can be adopted to estimate the
escape fraction of LyA and LyC in local star-forming galaxies and may serve as
a useful indirect indicator at the Epoch of Reionization.

Title:Multiple variability time-scales of the early nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet star WR7,"
Abstract:  We present the analysis of the optical variability of the early,
nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) star WR7. The analysis of multi-sector Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves and high-resolution
spectroscopic observations confirm multi-periodic variability that is modulated
on time-scales of years. We detect a dominant period of $2.6433 \pm 0.0005$ d
in the TESS sectors 33 and 34 light curves in addition to the previously
reported high-frequency features from sector 7. We discuss the plausible
mechanisms that may be responsible for such variability in WR7, including
pulsations, binarity, co-rotating interacting regions (CIRs) and clumpy winds.
Given the lack of strong evidence for the presence of a stellar or compact
companion, we suggest that WR7 may pulsate in quasi-coherent modes in addition
to wind variability likely caused by CIRs on top of stochastic low-frequency
variability. WR7 is certainly a worthy target for future monitoring in both
spectroscopy and photometry to sample both the short ($\lesssim 1$ d) and long
($\gtrsim 1000$ d) variability time scales.

"Title:The Astrophysical Distance Scale: V. A 2% Distance to the Local Group Spiral M33 via the JAGB Method, Tip of the Red Giant Branch, and Leavitt Law","
Abstract:  The J-region asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) method is a new standard candle
that is based on the stable intrinsic J-band magnitude of color-selected carbon
stars, and has a precision comparable to other primary distance indicators such
as Cepheids and the TRGB. We further test the accuracy of the JAGB method in
the Local Group Galaxy M33. M33's moderate inclination, low metallicity, and
nearby proximity make it an ideal laboratory for tests of systematics in local
distance indicators. Using high-precision optical BVI and near-infrared JHK
photometry, we explore the application of three independent distance
indicators: the JAGB method, the Cepheid Leavitt Law, and the TRGB. We find:
$\mu_0$ (TRGB I) = 24.72 +/- 0.02 (stat) +/- 0.07 (sys) mag, $\mu_0$ (TRGB NIR)
= 24.72 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.10 (sys) mag, $\mu_0$ (JAGB) = 24.67 +/- 0.03
(stat) +/- 0.04 (sys) mag, $\mu_0$ (Cepheid) = 24.71 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.01
(sys) mag. For the first time, we also directly compare a JAGB distance using
ground-based and space-based photometry. We measure: $\mu_0$ (JAGB F110W) =
24.71 +/- 0.06 (stat) +/- 0.05 (sys) mag using the (F814-F110W) color
combination to effectively isolate the JAGB stars. In this paper, we measure a
distance to M33 accurate to 2% and provide further evidence that the JAGB
method is a powerful extragalactic distance indicator that can effectively
probe a local measurement of the Hubble constant using spaced-based
observations. We expect to measure the Hubble constant via the JAGB method in
the near future, using observations from JWST.

Title:CHEX-MATE: Morphological analysis of the sample,"
Abstract:  In this work, we performed an analysis of the X-ray morphology of the 118
CHEX-MATE (Cluster HEritage project with XMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and
Thermodynamics at the Endpoint of structure formation) galaxy clusters, with
the aim to provide a classification of their dynamical state. To investigate
the link between the X-ray appearance and the dynamical state, we considered
four morphological parameters: the surface brightness concentration, the
centroid shift, and the second- and third-order power ratios. These indicators
result to be: strongly correlated with each other, powerful in identifying the
disturbed and relaxed population, characterised by a unimodal distribution and
not strongly influenced by systematic uncertainties. In order to obtain a
continuous classification of the CHEX-MATE objects, we combined these four
parameters in a single quantity, M, which represents the grade of relaxation of
a system. On the basis of the M value, we identified the most extreme systems
of the sample, finding 15 very relaxed and 27 very disturbed galaxy clusters.
From a comparison with previous analysis on X-ray selected samples, we
confirmed that the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) clusters tend to be more disturbed.
Finally, by applying our analysis on a simulated sample, we found a general
agreement between the observed and simulated results, with the only exception
of the concentration. This latter behaviour, is partially related to the
presence of particles with high smoothed-particle hydrodynamics density in the
central regions of the simulated clusters due to the action of the idealised
isotropic thermal Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback.

Title:Asteroid phase curves using sparse Gaia DR2 data and differential dense light curves,"
Abstract:  The amount of sparse asteroid photometry being gathered by both space- and
ground-based surveys is growing exponentially. This large volume of data poses
a computational challenge owing to both the large amount of information to be
processed and the new methods needed to combine data from different sources
(e.g. obtained by different techniques, in different bands, and having
different random and systematic errors). The main goal of this work is to
develop an algorithm capable of merging sparse and dense data sets, both
relative and differential, in preparation for asteroid observations originating
from, for example, Gaia, TESS, ATLAS, LSST, K2, VISTA, and many other sources.
We present a novel method to obtain asteroid phase curves by combining sparse
photometry and differential ground-based photometry. In the traditional
approach, the latter cannot be used for phase curves. Merging those two data
types allows for the extraction of phase-curve information for a growing number
of objects. Our method is validated for 26 sample asteroids observed by the
Gaia mission.

Title:Parker Solar Probe observations of near-$f_{\rm ce}$ harmonics emissions in the near-Sun solar wind and their dependence on the magnetic field direction,"
Abstract:  Wave emissions at frequencies near electron gyrofrequency harmonics are
observed at small heliocentric distances below about 40 solar radii and are
known to occur in regions with quiescent magnetic fields. We show the close
connection of these waves with the large-scale properties of the magnetic
field. Near electron gyrofrequency harmonics emissions occur only when the
ambient magnetic field points to a narrow range of directions bounded by polar
and azimuthal angular ranges in the RTN coordinate system of correspondingly
$80^{\circ} \lesssim \theta_B \lesssim 100^{\circ}$ and $10^{\circ} \lesssim
\phi_B \lesssim 30^{\circ}$. We show that the amplitudes of wave emissions are
highest when both angles are close to the center of their respective angular
interval favorable to wave emissions. The intensity of wave emissions
correlates with the magnetic field angular changes at both large and small time
scales. Wave emissions intervals correlate with intervals of decreases in the
amplitudes of broadband magnetic fluctuations at low frequencies of 10Hz-100Hz.
We discuss possible generation mechanisms of the waves.

Title:Detecting the impact of nuclear reactions on neutron star mergers through gravitational waves,"
Abstract:  Nuclear reactions may affect gravitational-wave signals from neutron-star
mergers, but the impact is uncertain. In order to quantify the effect, we
compare two numerical simulations representing intuitive extremes. In one case
reactions happen instantaneously. In the other case, they occur on timescales
much slower than the evolutionary timescale. We show that, while the
differences in the two gravitational-wave signals are small, they should be
detectable by third-generation observatories. To avoid systematic errors in
equation of state parameters inferred from observed signals, we need to
accurately implement nuclear reactions in future simulations.

Title:Boltzmann-Poisson-like approach to simulating the galactic halo response to satellite accretion Dependence on the halo density profile,"
Abstract:  Recent studies have reported the detection of the galactic stellar halo wake
and dipole triggered by the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), mirroring the
corresponding response from dark matter (DM). These studies open up the
possibility of adding constraints on the global mass distribution of the Milky
Way (MW), and even on the nature of DM itself, with current and upcoming
stellar surveys reigniting the discussion on response modes in dynamical
friction. However, the simulation of such features remains computationally
challenging. We used a collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE)+Poisson solver
based on an existing method from the literature. We investigated the density
and velocity response modes in simulations of Galactic-type DM halos accreting
LMC-sized satellites, including the dependence on the halo density profile. We
successfully captured both the local wake and the global over- and underdensity
induced in the host halo. We also captured the velocity response. In line with
previous studies, we find that the code can reproduce the core formation in the
cuspy profile and the satellite core stalling. The angular power spectrum (APS)
response is shown to be sensitive to each density profile. The cored Plummer
density profile seems the most responsive, displaying a richness of modes. At
the end of the simulation, the central halo acquires cylindrical rotation. The
CBE description makes it tenable to capture the response modes with a better
handling of noise in comparison to traditional N-body simulations. Hence, given
a certain noise level, BPM has a lower computational cost than N-body
simulations, making it feasible to explore large parameter sets. We anticipate
that stellar spheroids in the MW or external galaxies could show central
cylindrical rotation if they underwent a massive accretion event. The code can
be adjusted to include a variety of DM physics.

Title:Searches for Neutrinos from Gamma-Ray Bursts using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory,"
Abstract:  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are considered as promising sources of
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) due to their large power output.
Observing a neutrino flux from GRBs would offer evidence that GRBs are hadronic
accelerators of UHECRs. Previous IceCube analyses, which primarily focused on
neutrinos arriving in temporal coincidence with the prompt gamma rays, found no
significant neutrino excess. The four analyses presented in this paper extend
the region of interest to 14 days before and after the prompt phase, including
generic extended time windows and targeted precursor searches. GRBs were
selected between May 2011 and October 2018 to align with the data set of
candidate muon-neutrino events observed by IceCube. No evidence of correlation
between neutrino events and GRBs was found in these analyses. Limits are set to
constrain the contribution of the cosmic GRB population to the diffuse
astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. Prompt neutrino emission from
GRBs is limited to $\lesssim$1% of the observed diffuse neutrino flux, and
emission on timescales up to $10^4$ s is constrained to 24% of the total
diffuse flux.

Title:The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. IV. Isolated Protostars,"
Abstract:  We present $\sim10-40\,\mu$m \textit{SOFIA}-FORCAST images of 11 ""isolated""
protostars as part of the \textit{SOFIA} Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey,
with this morphological classification based on 37\,$\mu$m imaging. We develop
an automated method to define source aperture size based on the gradient of its
background-subtracted enclosed flux and apply this to build spectral energy
distributions (SEDs). We fit the SEDs with radiative transfer models, based on
the Turbulent Core Accretion (TCA) theory, to estimate key protostellar
properties. Here we release the \textit{sedcreator} python package that carries
out these methods. The SEDs are generally well-fit by the TCA models, from
which we infer initial core masses $M_c$ ranging from $50-430\:M_\odot$, clump
mass surface densities $\Sigma_{\rm cl}\sim0.1-2.3\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$ and
current protostellar masses $m_*\sim2-50\:M_\odot$. From a uniform analysis of
the 40 sources in the full SOMA survey to date, we find that massive protostars
form across a wide range of clump mass surface density environments, placing
constraints on theories that predict a minimum threshold $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$ for
massive star formation. However, the upper end of the $m_*-\Sigma_{\rm cl}$
distribution follows trends predicted by models of internal protostellar
feedback that find greater star formation efficiency in higher $\Sigma_{\rm
cl}$ conditions. We also investigate protostellar FIR variability by comparison
with IRAS data, finding no significant variation over a $\sim$40-year baseline.

"Title:Water, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, and dust production from distant comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1","
Abstract:  29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 is a distant Centaur/comet, showing persistent
CO-driven activity and frequent outbursts. We used the Herschel space
observatory in 2010, 2011, and 2013 to observe H$_2$O and NH$_3$ and to image
the dust coma. Observations with the IRAM 30 m were undertaken in 2007, 2010,
2011, and 2021 to monitor the CO production rate and to search for HCN.
Modeling was performed to constrain the size of the sublimating icy grains and
to derive the dust production rate. HCN is detected for the first time in comet
29P (at 5$\sigma$ in the line area). H$_2$O is detected as well, but not
NH$_3$. H$_2$O and HCN line shapes differ strongly from the CO line shape,
indicating that these two species are released from icy grains. CO production
rates are in the range (2.9-5.6) $\times$ 10$^{28}$ s$^{-1}$ (1400--2600 kg
s$^{-1}$). A correlation between the CO production rate and coma brightness is
observed, as is a correlation between CO and H$_2$O production. The correlation
obtained between the excess of CO production and excess of dust brightness with
respect to the quiescent state is similar to that established for the
continuous activity of comet Hale-Bopp. The measured $Q$(H$_2$O)/$Q$(CO) and
$Q$(HCN)/$Q$(CO) production rate ratios are 10.0 $\pm$ 1.5 % and 0.12 $\pm$
0.03 %, respectively, averaging the April-May 2010 measurements ($Q$(H$_2$O) =
(4.1 $\pm$ 0.6) $\times$ 10$^{27}$ s$^{-1}$, $Q$(HCN) = (4.8 $\pm$ 1.1)
$\times$ 10$^{25}$ s$^{-1}$). We derive three independent and similar values of
the effective radius of the nucleus, $\sim$ 31 $\pm$ 3 km. The inferred dust
mass-loss rates during quiescent phases are in the range 30-120 kg s$^{-1}$,
indicating a dust-to-gas mass ratio $<$ 0.1 during quiescent activity. We
conclude that strong local heterogeneities exist on the surface of 29P, with
quenched dust activity from most of the surface, but not in outbursting
regions.

Title:Accretion variability of the multiple T Tauri system VW Cha,"
Abstract:  Classical T Tauri stars are low-mass objects, which are still accreting
material from the surrounding circumstellar disk. The accretion process is
essential in the formation of Sun-like stars and in setting the properties of
the disk at the time when planet formation occurs. We constructed a complex
dataset in order to examine the accretion process of VW Cha, a classical T
Tauri multiple system with the aim of studying the physical origin of the
photometric and spectroscopic variability of the system. The TESS Space
Telescope observed VW Cha between 2019 April 22 and June 19, and we
complemented these data with contemporaneous ground-based $I_CJHK$ band
photometric measurements. In addition, we obtained high-resolution optical
spectra with the VLT/ESPRESSO and the 2.2\,m/FEROS instruments. Analyzing these
data, we found that the TESS light curve shows photometric variations on
timescales from minutes to weeks with a peak-to-peak amplitude of $\sim$0.8
mag. The near-infrared light curves follow the shape of the optical
measurements, however, the peak-to-peak amplitudes are slightly increasing
towards the longer wavelengths. We took spectra in both fainter and brighter
photometric states of the system, allowing us to examine the origin of a
photometric brightening event. Our results show that this brightening event can
be explained by increased accretion. In addition, our spectroscopic data also
suggest that the primary component of VW Cha is a spectroscopic binary, as it
was proposed in earlier works.

Title:Scaling relations of convective granulation noise across the HR diagram from 3D stellar atmosphere models,"
Abstract:  High-precision photometric data from space missions have improved our
understanding of stellar granulation. These observations have shown with
precision the stochastic brightness fluctuations of stars across the HR
diagram, allowing us to better understand how stellar surface convection reacts
to a change in stellar parameters. These fluctuations need to be understood and
quantified in order to improve the detection and characterization of
exoplanets. In this work, we provide new scaling relations of two
characteristic properties of the brightness fluctuations time series, the
standard deviation ($\sigma$) and the auto-correlation time ($\tau\rm_{eff}$).
This was done by using long time series of 3D stellar atmosphere models at
different metallicities and across the HR diagram, generated with a 3D
radiative hydrodynamical code: the STAGGER code. We compared our synthetic
granulation properties with the values of a large sample of Kepler stars, and
analyzed selected stars with accurate stellar parameters from the Kepler LEGACY
sample. Our 3D models showed that $\sigma\propto\nu\rm_{max}^{-0.567\pm0.012}$
and $\tau\rm_{eff}\propto\nu\rm_{max}^{-0.997\pm0.018}$ for stars at solar
metallicity. We showed that both $\sigma$ and $\tau\rm_{eff}$ decrease with
metallicity, although the metallicity dependence is more significant on
$\sigma$. Unlike previous studies, we found very good agreement between
$\sigma$ from Kepler targets and the 3D models at $\log{g}\leq3.5$, and a good
correlation between the stars and models with $\log{g}\geq3.5$. For
$\tau\rm_{eff}$, we found that the 3D models reproduced well the Kepler LEGACY
star values. Overall, this study shows that 3D stellar atmosphere models
reproduce the granulation properties of stars across the HR diagram.

Title:Optical depth to reionization from perturbative 21cm clustering,"
Abstract:  The optical depth $\tau$ is the least well determined parameter in the
standard model of cosmology, and one whose precise value is important for both
understanding reionization and for inferring fundamental physics from
cosmological measurements. We forecast how well future epoch of reionization
experiments could constraint $\tau$ using a symmetries-based bias expansion
that highlights the special role played by anisotropies in the power spectrum
on large scales. Given a parametric model for the ionization evolution inspired
by the physical behavior of more detailed reionization simulations, we find
that future 21cm experiments could place tight constraints on the timing and
duration of reionization and hence constraints on $\tau$ that are competitive
with proposed, space-based CMB missions provided they can measure $k\approx
0.1\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ with a clean foreground wedge across redshifts
spanning the most active periods of reionization, corresponding to ionization
fractions $0.2 \lesssim x \lesssim 0.8$. Significantly improving upon existing
CMB-based measurements with next-generation 21cm surveys would require
substantially longer observations ($\sim5$ years) than standard
$\mathcal{O}(1000 \,\,\text{hour})$ integration times. Precise measurements of
smaller scales will not improve constraints on $\tau$ until a better
understanding of the astrophysics of reionization is achieved. In the presence
of noise and foregrounds even future 21cm experiments will struggle to
constrain $\tau$ if the ionization evolution deviates significantly from simple
parametric forms.

area over $15\,000 \ \mathrm{deg}^2$ in the redshift range $0.9<z<1.8\ -$ will
provide a sample of tens of thousands of cosmic voids. This paper explores for
the first time the constraining power of the void size function on the
properties of dark energy (DE) from a survey mock catalogue, the official
Euclid Flagship simulation. We identify voids in the Flagship light-cone, which
closely matches the features of the upcoming Euclid spectroscopic data set. We
model the void size function considering a state-of-the art methodology: we
rely on the volume conserving (Vdn) model, a modification of the popular Sheth
& van de Weygaert model for void number counts, extended by means of a linear
function of the large-scale galaxy bias. We find an excellent agreement between
model predictions and measured mock void number counts. We compute updated
forecasts for the Euclid mission on DE from the void size function and provide
reliable void number estimates to serve as a basis for further forecasts of
cosmological applications using voids. We analyse two different cosmological
models for DE: the first described by a constant DE equation of state
parameter, $w$, and the second by a dynamic equation of state with coefficients
$w_0$ and $w_a$. We forecast $1\sigma$ errors on $w$ lower than the $10\%$, and
we estimate an expected figure of merit (FoM) for the dynamical DE scenario
$\mathrm{FoM}_{w_0,w_a} = 17$ when considering only the neutrino mass as
additional free parameter of the model. The analysis is based on conservative
assumptions to ensure full robustness, and is a pathfinder for future
enhancements of the technique. Our results showcase the impressive constraining
power of the void size function from the Euclid spectroscopic sample, both as a
stand-alone probe, and to be combined with other Euclid cosmological probes.

galaxies found behind the HFF clusters. For the first time, we present
faint-end slope results from lensed samples that are fully consistent with
blank-field results over the redshift range z=2-9, while reaching to much lower
luminosities than possible from the blank-field studies. Combining the deep
lensed sample with the large blank-field samples allows us to set the tight
constraints on the faint-end slope alpha of the z=2-9 UV LFs and its evolution.
We find a smooth flattening in alpha from -2.28+/-0.10 (z=9) to -1.53+/-0.03
(z=2) with cosmic time (d(alpha)/dz=-0.11+/-0.01), fully consistent with dark
matter halo buildup. We utilize these new results to present new measurements
of the evolution in the UV luminosity density rho(UV) brightward of -13 mag
from z~9 to z~2. Accounting for the SFR densities to faint luminosities implied
by our LF results, we find that unobscured star formation dominates the SFR
density at z>~4, with obscured star formation dominant thereafter. Having shown
we can quantify the faint-end slope alpha of the LF accurately with our lensed
HFF samples, we also quantify the apparent curvature in the shape of the UV LF
through a curvature parameter delta. The constraints on the curvature delta
strongly rule out the presence of a turn-over brightward of -13.1 mag at z~3,
-14.3 mag at z~6, and -15.5 mag at all other redshifts between z~9 to z~2.

observational techniques. Thus, we investigate the scaling relations between
the soft-band X-ray luminosity, spectroscopic temperature, gas mass fraction,
$Y_{\rm X}$ and $Y_{\rm SZ}$ as a function of halo mass, and we find broad
agreement between IllustrisTNG and the observed relations. Our results
highlight the scatter and bias introduced by estimated masses, and thus the
importance of converting simulated ICM properties to the observable space when
comparing simulations to current X-ray observations. The wide range of halo
masses in our sample provides new insights into the shape of the X-ray and SZ
scaling relations across three orders of magnitude in mass. Our findings show
strong evidence for a break in $z=0$ scaling relations. We introduce a smoothly
broken power law model which robustly captures the location of this break, the
width of the transition region around the break, as well as the slope
dependence on halo mass. Our results inform the next generation of subgrid
black hole feedback models and provide predictions for ongoing and future

Abstract:  We compute the density and velocity power spectra at next-to-next-to-leading
order taking into account the effect of time- and scale-dependent growth of
massive neutrino perturbations as well as the departure from
Einstein--de-Sitter (EdS) dynamics at late times non-linearly. We determine the
impact of these effects by comparing to the commonly adopted approximate
treatment where they are not included. For the bare cold dark matter
(CDM)+baryon spectrum, we find percent deviations for $k\gtrsim
0.17h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, mainly due to the departure from EdS. For the
velocity and cross power spectrum the main difference arises due to time- and
scale-dependence in presence of massive neutrinos yielding percent deviation
above $k\simeq 0.08, 0.13, 0.16h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.4,

$k_{\mathrm{FS}}$ is the neutrino free-streaming scale. Comparing to Quijote
N-body simulations, we find that for the CDM+baryon density power spectrum the
effect of neutrino perturbations and exact time-dependent dynamics at late
times can be accounted for by a shift in the one-loop EFT counterterm,
$\Delta\bar{\gamma}_1 \simeq - 0.2~\mathrm{Mpc}^2/h^2$. We find percent
agreement between the perturbative and N-body results up to $k\lesssim
0.12h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $k\lesssim 0.16h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at one- and
two-loop order, respectively, for all considered neutrino masses $\sum m_{\nu}
\leq 0.4~\mathrm{eV}$.

Title:MgII in the JWST Era: a Probe of Lyman Continuum Escape?,"
Abstract:  Limited constraints on the evolution of the Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape
fraction represent one of the primary uncertainties in the theoretical
determination of the reionization history. Due to the intervening intergalactic
medium (IGM), the possibility of observing LyC photons directly in the epoch of
reionization is highly unlikely. For this reason, multiple indirect probes of
LyC escape have been identified, some of which are used to identify
low-redshift LyC leakers (e.g. O32), while others are primarily useful at $z>6$
(e.g. [OIII]/[CII] far infrared emission). The flux ratio of the resonant MgII
doublet emission at 2796$\dot{\rm A}$ and 2803$\dot{\rm A}$ as well as the MgII
optical depth have recently been proposed as ideal diagnostics of LyC leakage
that can be employed at $z>6$ with JWST. Using state-of-the-art cosmological
radiation hydrodynamics simulations post-processed with CLOUDY and
resonant-line radiative transfer, we test whether MgII is indeed a useful probe
of LyC leakage. Our simulations indicate that the majority of bright,
star-forming galaxies with high LyC escape fractions are expected to be MgII
emitters rather than absorbers at $z=6$. However, we find that the MgII doublet
flux ratio is a more sensitive indicator of dust rather than neutral hydrogen,
limiting its use as a LyC leakage indicator to only galaxies in the optically
thin regime. Given its resonant nature, we show that MgII will be an exciting
probe of the complex kinematics in high-redshift galaxies in upcoming JWST
observations.

Title:Implications of a Temperature Dependent IMF I: Photometric Template Fitting,"
Abstract:  A universal stellar initial mass function (IMF) should not be expected from
theoretical models of star formation, but little conclusive observational
evidence for a variable IMF has been uncovered. In this paper, a
parameterization of the IMF is introduced into photometric template fitting of
the COSMOS2015 catalog. The resulting best-fit templates suggest systematic
variations in the IMF, with most galaxies exhibiting top-heavier stellar
populations than in the Milky Way. At fixed redshift, only a small range of
IMFs are found, with the typical IMF becoming progressively top-heavier with
increasing redshift. Additionally, subpopulations of ULIRGs, quiescent- and
star-forming galaxies are compared with predictions of stellar population
feedback and show clear qualitative similarities to the evolution of dust
temperatures.

Title:Unifying Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and X-ray predictions from clusters to galaxy groups: the impact of X-ray mass estimates on the $Y-M$ scaling relation,"
Abstract:  One of the main limitations in precision cluster cosmology arises from
systematic errors and uncertainties in estimating cluster masses. Using the
Mock-X pipeline, we produce synthetic X-ray images and derive cluster and
galaxy group X-ray properties for a sample of over 30,000 simulated galaxy
groups and clusters with $M_{\rm 500crit}$ between $10^{12}$ and $2\times
10^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$ in IllustrisTNG. We explore the similarities and
differences between IllustrisTNG predictions of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and
X-ray scaling relations with mass. We find a median hydrostatic mass bias $b =
0.125 \pm 0.003$ for $M_{\rm 500crit}$ $>10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$. The bias
increases to $b = 0.17 \pm 0.004$ when masses are derived from synthetic X-ray
observations. We model how different underlying assumptions about the
dependence of $Y_{\rm X}$ on halo mass can generate biases in the observed
$Y_{\rm SZ} - M_{Y_{\rm X}}$ scaling relation. In particular, the simplifying
assumption that $Y_{\rm X} - M_{\rm tot}$ is self-similar at all mass scales
largely hides the break in $Y_{\rm SZ} - M_{\rm tot}$ and overestimates $Y_{\rm
SZ}$ at galaxy and groups scales. We show that calibrating the $Y_{\rm X}-$mass
proxy using a new model for a smoothly broken power law reproduces the true
underlying $Y_{\rm SZ} - M_{\rm tot}$ scaling relation with high accuracy.
Moreover, $M_{Y_{\rm X}}$ estimates calibrated with this method lead to $Y_{\rm
SZ} - M_{Y_{\rm X}}$ predictions that are not biased by the presence of lower
mass clusters or galaxy groups in the sample. Finally, we show that our
smoothly broken power law model provides a robust way to derive the $Y_{\rm
X}-$mass proxy, significantly reducing the level of mass bias for clusters,
groups, and galaxies.

Title:Time-dependent interpretation of the neutrino emission from Tidal Disruption Events,"
Abstract:  Three tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates (AT2019dsg, AT2019fdr,
AT2019aalc) have been associated with high energy astrophysical neutrinos in
multi-messenger follow-ups. In all cases, the neutrino observation occurred
O(100) days after the maximum of the optical-ultraviolet (OUV) luminosity. We
discuss unified fully time-dependent interpretations of these events, where the
neutrino delays are not a statistical effect, but rather the consequence of a
physical scale of the post-disruption system. Noting that X-rays and infrared
(IR) dust echoes have been observed in all cases, we consider three models in
which quasi-isotropic neutrino emission is due to the interactions of
accelerated protons of moderate, medium, and high energy energies with X-rays,
OUV, and IR photons, respectively. We find that the neutrino time delays can be
well described in the X-ray model assuming magnetic confinement of protons in a
calorimetric approach, and in the IR model, where the delay is directly
correlated with the time evolution of the echo luminosity (for which a model is
developed here). The OUV model exhibits the highest neutrino production
efficiency. In all three models, the highest neutrino fluence is predicted for
AT2019aalc, due to its high estimated SMBH mass and low redshift. All models
result in diffuse neutrino fluxes that are consistent with observations.

Title:MUSUBI (MegaCam Ultra-deep Survey: $u^\ast$-Band Imaging)-Data for the COSMOS and SXDS Fields,"
Abstract:  The Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Strategic Survey is the latest-generation
multi-band optical imaging survey for galaxy evolution and structure formation.
The ""Ultra-Deep"" component of the HSC survey provides $grizy$ broad-band images
over $\sim3.4$ deg$^2$ to detection limits of $\sim26$-28 AB, along with
narrow-band images, in the COSMOS and the SXDS fields. These images provide an
unprecedented combination of depths and area coverage, for the studies galaxies
up to $z\sim7$. However, the lack of coverage at $<4000$ Ang implies incomplete
sampling of the rest-frame UV at $z\lesssim 3$, which is critically needed for
understanding the buildup of stellar mass in the later cosmic time. We
conducted a multi-year CFHT $u^\ast$-band imaging campaign in the two HSC
Ultra-Deep fields with CFHT MegaCam. By including shallower archival data, we
reach 5-$\sigma$ depths of $u^\ast=28.1$ and 28.4 (AB) at the centers of the
COSMOS and SXDS fields, respectively, and $u^\ast=27.7$ and 27.8 in the central
1 deg$^2$ fields. The image quality is $\gtrsim0.90$ arcsec, fairly good for
the $u^\ast$ band. Both the photometric and astrometric quality of our data are
excellent. We show that the combination of our $u^\ast$-band and HSC data can
lead to high-quality photometric redshifts at $z=0$-3, and robust measurements
of rest-frame UV on galaxies at $0.4<z<0.6$ for distinguishing green-valley
galaxies from star-forming and quiescent galaxies. We publicly release our
reduced $u^\ast$-band images and reference catalogs that can be used readily
for scientific studies.

Title:CMB constraints on DHOST theories,"
Abstract:  We put constraints on the degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST)
theories using the Planck 2018 likelihoods. In our previous paper, we developed
a Boltzmann solver incorporating the effective field theory parameterised by
the six time-dependent functions, $\alpha_i$ $(i={\rm B},{\rm K},{\rm T},{\rm
M},{\rm H})$ and $\beta_1$, which can describe the DHOST theories. Using the
Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method with our Boltzmann solver, we find the viable
parameter region of the model parameters characterising the DHOST theories and
the other standard cosmological parameters. First, we consider a simple model
with $\alpha_{\rm K} = \Omega_{\rm DE}(t)/\Omega_{\rm DE}(t_0)$, $\alpha_{\rm
B}=\alpha_{\rm T}=\alpha_{\rm M}=\alpha_{\rm H}=0$ and
$\beta_1=\beta_{1,0}\Omega_{\rm DE}(t)/\Omega_{\rm DE}(t_0)$ in the
$\Lambda$CDM background where $t_0$ is the present time and obtain
$\beta_{1,0}=0.032_{-0.016}^{+0.013}$ (68\% c.l.). Next, we focus on another
theory given by $\mathcal{L}_{\rm DHOST} = X + c_3X\Box\phi/\Lambda^3+ (M_{\rm
pl}^2/2+c_4X^2/\Lambda^6)R + 48c_4^2X^2/(M_{\rm

with $X:=\partial_\mu\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi$ and two positive constant
parameters, $c_3$ and $c_4$. In this model, we consistently treat the
background and the perturbations, and obtain $c_3 = 1.59^{+0.26}_{-0.28}$ and
the upper bound on $c_4$, $c_4<0.0088$ (68\% c.l.).

Title:Keck/NIRSPEC studies of He I in the atmospheres of two inflated hot gas giants orbiting K dwarfs: WASP-52b and WASP-177b,"
Abstract:  We present the detection of neutral helium at 10833A in the atmosphere of
WASP-52b and tentative evidence of helium in the atmosphere of the grazing
WASP-177b, using high-resolution observations acquired with the NIRSPEC
instrument on the Keck II telescope. We detect excess absorption by helium in
WASP-52b's atmosphere of $3.44 \pm 0.31$% ($11\sigma$), or equivalently $66 \pm
5$ atmospheric scale heights. This absorption is centered on the planet's rest
frame ($\Delta v = 0.00 \pm 1.19$km s$^{-1}$). We model the planet's escape
using a 1D Parker wind model and calculate its mass-loss rate to be $\sim 1.4
\times 10^{11}$g s$^{-1}$, or equivalently 0.5% of its mass per Gyr. For
WASP-177b, we see evidence for red-shifted ($\Delta v = 6.02 +/- 1.88$km
s$^{-1}$) helium-like absorption of $1.28 \pm 0.29$% (equal to $23 \pm 5$
atmospheric scale heights). However, due to residual systematics in the
transmission spectrum of similar amplitude, we do not interpret this as
significant evidence for He absorption in the planet's atmosphere. Using a 1D
Parker wind model, we set a $3\sigma$ upper limit on WASP-177b's escape rate of
$7.9 \times 10^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$. Our results, taken together with recent
literature detections, suggest the tentative relation between XUV irradiation
and He I absorption amplitude may be shallower than previously suggested. Our
results highlight how metastable helium can advance our understanding of
atmospheric loss and its role in shaping the exoplanet population.

Title:Variability and phase lags of the type-C quasi-periodic oscillation of MAXI J1348-630 with NICER,"
Abstract:  We study the properties of the type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (type-C QPO)
of MAXI J1348-630 during its 2019 outburst and reflare with NICER. This is the
first time that the evolution of the properties of type-C QPOs is studied
during an outburst reflare. We found that the properties of the type-C QPO
during the reflare are similar to those of type-C QPOs observed in other
black-hole systems during outburst. This suggests that the physical processes
responsible for type-C QPOs are the same in a reflare and in an outburst. We
also found that the FWHM of a high-frequency broadband component observed
during the reflare changes significantly with energy. We studied the
energy-dependent fractional rms amplitude and phase lags of the type-C QPO from
0.5 keV to 12 keV. We found that the fractional rms amplitude increases up to
2-3 keV and then remains approximately constant above this energy, and the lag
spectra of the type-C QPO are hard. We discuss the dependence of the fractional
rms amplitude and phase lags with energy in the context of Comptonisation as
the radiative mechanism driving the QPO rms and lag spectra.

Title:Bayesian error propagation for neural-net based parameter inference,"
Abstract:  Neural nets have become popular to accelerate parameter inferences,
especially for the upcoming generation of galaxy surveys in cosmology. As
neural nets are approximative by nature, a recurrent question has been how to
propagate the neural net's approximation error, in order to avoid biases in the
parameter inference. We present a Bayesian solution to propagating a neural
net's approximation error and thereby debiasing parameter inference. We exploit
that a neural net reports its approximation errors during the validation phase.
We capture the thus reported approximation errors via the highest-order summary
statistics, allowing us to eliminate the neural net's bias during inference,
and propagating its uncertainties. We demonstrate that our method is quickly
implemented and successfully infers parameters even for strongly biased neural
nets. In summary, our method provides the missing element to judge the accuracy
of a posterior if it cannot be computed based on an infinitely accurately
theory code.

Title:XMM-Newton and Swift Observations of the Seyfert 1 AGN NGC 5940,"
Abstract:  Probing the physics of the accretion flow around active galactic nuclei (AGN)
is crucial to understanding their emission mechanisms as well as being able to
constrain the geometrical and variability properties of the different regions
around them. The soft X-ray excess -- usually observed below
$\sim2\,\mathrm{keV}$ in excess of the dominant X-ray powerlaw continuum -- is
one prominent feature that is commonly seen in type 1 Seyfert AGN and therefore
readily provides a useful diagnostic of the accretion flow mechanism around
these systems. NGC 5940 is a Seyfert 1 AGN which reveals strong, prominent soft
X-ray excess below $\sim2\,\mathrm{keV}$ as seen in both its XMM-Newton and
Swift observations. Model fit to the data revealed that this feature could be
equally well explained by the ionised partial covering, the thermal
Comptonisation and the blurred reflection models. Although the other models
cannot be decisively ruled out with the data at hand, the lack of significant
broad iron $K_{\alpha}$ as well as any significant emission/absorption line
features in the reflection grating spectrometer (RGS) data tend to favour the
thermal Comptonisation origin for the soft X-ray excess in NGC 5940.

Title:The star-formation rates of QSOs,"
Abstract:  We examine the far-IR properties of a sample of 5391 optically selected QSOs
in the 0.5<z<2.65 redshift range down to log[nuLnu,2500 (erg/s)]>44.7, using
SPIRE data from Herschel-ATLAS. We split the sample in a grid of 74
luminosity-redshift bins and compute the average optical-infrared spectral
energy distribution (SED) in each bin. By normalising an intrinsic AGN template
to the AGN optical power (at 5100A) we decompose the total infrared emission
(L_IR; 8-1000um) into an AGN (L_IR,AGN) and star-forming component (L_IR,SF).
We find that the AGN contribution to L_IR increases as a function of AGN power
which manifests as a reduction of the `far-IR bump' in the average QSO SEDs. We
note that L_IR,SF does not correlate with AGN power; the mean star formation
rates (SFRs) of AGN host galaxies are a function of redshift only and they
range from ~6 Msun/yr at z~0 to a plateau of <200 Msun/yr at z~2.6. Our results
indicate that the accuracy of far-IR emission as a proxy for SFR decreases with
increasing AGN luminosity. We show that, at any given redshift, observed trends
between infrared luminosity (whether monochromatic or total) and AGN power (in
the optical or X-rays) can be explained by a simple model which is the sum of
two components: (A) the infrared emission from star-formation, uncorrelated
with AGN power and (B) the infrared emission from AGN, directly proportional to
AGN power in the optical or X-rays.

Cep stars, we combine polarimetry with space-based photometry and archival
spectroscopy to identify the dominant nonradial mode in polarimetry, f2, as l =
3, m = -3 (in the m-convention of Dziembowski) and determine the stellar axis
position angle as 25 (or 205) +/- 8 deg. The rotation axis inclination to the

spectroscopy, facilitating identification of additional modes and allowing for

Title:Toward a Unified Explanation for the Three-part Structure of Solar Coronal Mass Ejections,"
Abstract:  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are associated with the eruption of magnetic
flux ropes (MFRs), which usually appear as hot channels in active regions and
coronal cavities in quiet-Sun regions. CMEs often exhibit the classical
three-part structure in the lower corona when imaged with white-light
coronagraphs, including the bright front, dark cavity, and bright core. The
bright core and dark cavity have been regarded as the erupted prominence and
MFR, respectively, for several decades. However, recent studies clearly
demonstrated that both the prominence and hot-channel MFR can be observed as
the CME core. The current research presents a three-part CME resulted from the
eruption of a coronal prominence cavity on 2010 October 7 with observations
from two vantage perspectives, i.e., edge-on from the Earth and face-on from
the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). Our observations
illustrates two important results: (1) For the first time, the erupting coronal
cavity is recorded as a channel-like structure in the extreme-ultraviolet
passband, analogous to the hot-channel morphology, and is dubbed as warm
channel; (2) Both the prominence and warm-channel MFR (coronal cavity) in the
extreme-ultraviolet passbands evolve into the CME core in the white-light
coronagraphs of STEREO-A. The results support that we are walking toward a
unified explanation for the three-part structure of CMEs, in which both
prominences and MFRs (hot or warm channels) are responsible for the bright
core.

article, we present an effective field theory (EFT) analysis of the CDMSlite
Run 2 data using an extended energy range and a comprehensive treatment of the
expected background. A binned likelihood Bayesian analysis was performed on the
recoil energy data, taking into account the parameters of the EFT interactions
and optimizing the data selection with respect to the dominant background
components. Energy regions within 5$\sigma$ of known activation peaks were
removed from the analysis. The Bayesian evidences resulting from the different
operator hypotheses show that the CDMSlite Run 2 data are consistent with the
background-only models and do not allow for a signal interpretation assuming
any additional EFT interaction. Consequently, upper limits on the WIMP mass and
coupling-coefficient amplitudes and phases are presented for each EFT operator.
These limits improve previous CDMSlite Run 2 bounds for WIMP masses above 5
GeV/$c^2$.

Title:Mass-Ratio Distribution of Binaries From the LAMOST-MRS Survey,"
Abstract:  Binary evolution leads to the formation of important objects crucial to the
development of astrophysics, but the statistical properties of binary
populations are still poorly understood. The LAMOST-MRS has provided a large
sample of stars to study the properties of binary populations, especially for
the mass ratio distributions and the binary fractions. We have devised a Peak
Amplitude Ratio (PAR) approach to derive the mass ratio of a binary system
based on results obtained from its spectrum. By computing a cross-correlation
function (CCF), we established a relationship between the derived mass ratio
and the PARs of the binary systems. By utilizing spectral observations obtained
from LAMSOT DR6 & DR7, we applied the PAR approach to form distributions of the
derived mass ratio of the binary systems to the spectral types. We selected the
mass ratio within the range of $0.6-1.0$ for investigating the mass-ratio
distribution. Through a power-law fitting, we obtained the power index $\gamma$

G-type stars identified in the sample, respectively. The derived

Abstract:  Slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in stellar coronal loops with gravitational
stratification are analyzed with a numerical solution of the boundary-value
problem for eigenvalues and eigen functions. In this study, we only focus on
the resonant periods. The effects of the gravitational stratification, star
mass, loop temperature, and loop length on the properties of slow
magnetoacoustic oscillations are investigated. It is shown that the discrepancy
between stratified and non-stratified loops is higher in density perturbations
than velocity perturbations. When the star has larger mass, higher coronal
temperature, and longer loop, the density perturbations in stratified loop are
significantly different from the harmonic functions. The periods in the
stratified loop are slightly longer than in the non-stratified loop. The
periods calculated in our model (14-644 min) are consistent with the periods of
stellar quasi-periodic pulsations observed in both soft x-rays (2-70 min) and

Title:Charting Galactic Accelerations with Stellar Streams and Machine Learning,"
Abstract:  We present a data-driven method for reconstructing the galactic acceleration
field from phase-space measurements of stellar streams. Our approach is based
on a flexible and differentiable fit to the stream in phase-space, enabling a
direct estimate of the acceleration vector along the stream. Reconstruction of
the local acceleration field can be applied independently to each of several
streams, allowing us to sample the acceleration field due to the underlying
galactic potential across a range of scales. Our approach is methodologically
different from previous works, since a model for the gravitational potential
does not need to be adopted beforehand. Instead, our flexible
neural-network-based model treats the stream as a collection of orbits with a
locally similar mixture of energies, rather than assuming that the stream
delineates a single stellar orbit. Accordingly, our approach allows for
distinct regions of the stream to have different mean energies, as is the case
for real stellar streams. Once the acceleration vector is sampled along the
stream, standard analytic models for the galactic potential can then be rapidly
constrained. We find our method recovers the correct parameters for a
ground-truth triaxial logarithmic halo potential when applied to simulated
stellar streams. Alternatively, we demonstrate that a flexible potential can be
constrained with a neural network, though standard multipole expansions can
also be constrained. Our approach is applicable to simple and complicated
gravitational potentials alike, and enables potential reconstruction from a
fully data-driven standpoint using measurements of slowly phase-mixing tidal
debris.

Title:Euclid: Fast two-point correlation function covariance through linear construction,"
Abstract:  We present a method for fast evaluation of the covariance matrix for a
two-point galaxy correlation function (2PCF) measured with the Landy-Szalay

running the estimator on a large number of mock catalogs, and evaluating their
sample covariance. With large random catalog sizes (data-to-random objects
ratio M>>1) the computational cost of the standard method is dominated by that
of counting the data-random and random-random pairs, while the uncertainty of
the estimate is dominated by that of data-data pairs. We present a method
called Linear Construction (LC), where the covariance is estimated for small
random catalogs of size M = 1 and M = 2, and the covariance for arbitrary M is
constructed as a linear combination of these. We validate the method with
PINOCCHIO simulations in range r = 20-200 Mpc/h, and show that the covariance
estimate is unbiased. With M = 50 and with 2 Mpc/h bins, the theoretical
speed-up of the method is a factor of 14. We discuss the impact on the

Title:On the energy dependence of the QPO phenomenon in the black hole system MAXI J1535-571,"
Abstract:  Previous analysis of AstroSat observations of the black hole system MAXI
J1535-571, have revealed the presence of a strong Quasi-Periodic Oscillation
(QPO) whose frequency is correlated with the high energy spectral index. Here,
we fit the spectra as emitted from a truncated disc with an inner hot corona,
study the QPO frequency dependence on other spectral parameters and model the
energy dependent r.m.s and time-lag of the QPO to identify the physical
spectral parameters whose variation are responsible for the QPO. The QPO
frequency is found to also correlate with the scattering fraction (i.e. the
fraction of the soft photons Comptonized) and its dependence on the accretion
rate and inner disc radii is consistent with it being the dynamical frequency.
The time-lag between the hard and soft photons is negative for QPO frequency >
2.2 Hz and is positive for lesser values, making this the second black hole

dependent time-lag and r.m.s requires correlated variation of the accretion
rate, inner disc radii and the coronal heating rate, with the latter having a
time-lag compared to the other two for QPO frequencies less than < 2.2 Hz and
which changes sign (i.e. the coronal heating variation precedes the accretion
rate one) for higher values. The implications of the results are discussed.

Title:Redshift drift in a universe with structure I: Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi structures with arbitrary angle of entry of light,"
Abstract:  We consider the redshift drift and position drift associated with
astrophysical sources in a formalism that is suitable for describing emitters
and observers of light in an arbitrary spacetime geometry, while identifying
emitters of a given null-geodesic bundle that arrives at the observer
worldline. We then restrict the situation to the special case of a
Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) geometrical structure, and solve for light rays
propagating through the structure with arbitrary impact parameters, i.e., with
arbitrary angles of entry into the LTB structure. The redshift drift signal
emitted by comoving sources and viewed by a comoving observer turns out to be
dominated by Ricci curvature and electric Weyl curvature contributions as
integrated along the connecting light ray. This property simplifies the
computations of the redshift drift signal tremendously, and we expect that the
property extends to more complicated models including Swiss-cheese models. When
considering several null rays with random impact parameters, the mean redshift
drift signal is well approximated by a single Ricci focusing term. This
suggests that the measurement of cosmological redshift drift can be used as a
direct probe of the strong energy condition in a realistic universe where
photons pass through many successive structures.

Title:A VLBA Trigonometric Parallax for RR Aql and the Mira PL Relation,"
Abstract:  We report VLBA observations of 22 GHz H$_{2}$O and 43 GHz SiO masers toward
the Mira variable RR Aql. By fitting the SiO maser emission to a circular ring,
we estimate the absolute stellar position of RR Aql and find agreement with
Gaia astrometry to within the joint uncertainty of $\approx1$ mas. Using the
maser astrometry we measure a stellar parallax of 2.44 $\pm$ 0.07 mas,
corresponding to a distance of 410$^{+12}_{-11}$ pc. The maser parallax
deviates significantly from the Gaia EDR3 parallax of 1.95 $\pm$ 0.11 mas,
indicating a $3.8\sigma$ tension between radio and optical measurements. This
tension is most likely caused by optical photo-center variations limiting the
Gaia astrometric accuracy for this Mira variable. Combining infrared magnitudes
with parallaxes for RR Aql and other Miras, we fit a period-luminosity relation
using a Bayesian approach with MCMC sampling and a strong prior for the slope
of -3.60 $\pm$ 0.30 from the LMC. We find a $K$-band zero-point (defined at
logP(days) = 2.30) of -6.79 $\pm$ 0.15 mag using VLBI parallaxes and -7.08
$\pm$ 0.29 mag using Gaia parallaxes. The Gaia zero-point is statistically
consistent with the more accurate VLBI value.

Title:Transient acceleration events in LISA Pathfinder data: properties and possible physical origin,"
Abstract:  We present an in depth analysis of the transient events, or glitches,
detected at a rate of about one per day in the differential acceleration data
of LISA Pathfinder. We show that these glitches fall in two rather distinct
categories: fast transients in the interferometric motion readout on one side,
and true force transient events on the other. The former are fast and rare in
ordinary conditions. The second may last from seconds to hours and constitute
the majority of the glitches. We present an analysis of the physical and
statistical properties of both categories, including a cross-analysis with
other time series like magnetic fields, temperature, and other dynamical
variables. Based on these analyses we discuss the possible sources of the force
glitches and identify the most likely, among which the outgassing environment
surrounding the test-masses stands out. We discuss the impact of these findings
on the LISA design and operation, and some risk mitigation measures, including
experimental studies that may be conducted on the ground, aimed at clarifying
some of the questions left open by our analysis.

Title:A tale of caution: the tails of NGC 752 are much longer than claimed,"
Abstract:  Understanding the exact extent and content of tidal tails of open clusters
provide useful clues on how field stars populate the Milky Way. We reanalyse,
using Gaia EDR3 data, the tails around the open cluster NGC 752. Compared to
previous analyses, we look at a much wider region around the cluster and use
first the convergent point method, coupled with a clustering analysis using
DBSCAN. We find that the cluster, located 433 pc away and well described by a
Plummer profile, has very long and asymmetric tails, extending more than 260 pc
on the sky (from tip to tip) - four times larger than previously thought - and
contains twice as many stars. Numerical models computed with PETAR serve as
guide and confirm our analysis. The tails follows the predictions from models,
but the trailing tail appears slightly distorted, possibly indicating that the
cluster had a complicated history of galactic encounters. Applying an
alternative method to the newly developed compact convergent method, we
potentially trace the cluster's tidal tails to their full extent, covering
several thousands of parsecs and more than 1,000 stars. Our analysis therefore
opens a new window on the study of open clusters, whose potential will be fully
unleashed with future Gaia data releases.

Title:Theoretical distribution of the ammonia binding energy at interstellar icy grains: a new computational framework,"
Abstract:  The binding energies (BE) of molecules on the interstellar grains are crucial
in the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM). Both temperature
programmed desorption (TPD) laboratory experiments and quantum chemistry
computations have often provided, so far, only single values of the BE for each
molecule. This is a severe limitation, as the ices enveloping the grain mantles
are structurally amorphous, giving rise to a manifold of possible adsorption
sites, each with different BEs. However, the ice amorphous nature prevents the
knowledge of structural details, hindering the development of a common accepted
atomistic icy model. In this work, we propose a computational framework that
closely mimics the formation of the interstellar grain mantle through a water
by water accretion. On that grain, an unbiased random (but well reproducible)
positioning of the studied molecule is then carried out. Here we present the
test case of NH$_3$, an ubiquitous species in the molecular ISM. We provide the
BE distribution computed by a hierarchy approach, using the semiempirical
xTB-GFN2 as low-level method to describe the whole icy cluster combined with
the B97D3 DFT functional as high-level method on the local zone of the NH$_3$
interaction. The final ZPE corrected BE is computed at
ONIOM(DLPNO-CCSD(T)//B97D3:xTB-GFN2) level, ensuring the best cost/accuracy
ratio. The main peak of the predicted NH$_3$ BE distribution is in agreement
with experimental TPD and literature computed data. A second broad peak at very
low BE values is also present, never detected before. It may provide the
solution to a long-standing puzzle about the presence of gaseous NH$_3$
observed also in cold ISM objects.

"Title:Diagnosing the interstellar medium of galaxies with far-infrared emission lines II. [C II], [O I], [O III], [N II] and [N III] up to z=6","
Abstract:  Gas cooling processes in the interstellar medium (ISM) are key to
understanding how star-formation processes occur in galaxies. Far-infrared
(FIR) fine-structure emission lines can be used as a tool to understand the gas
conditions and trace the different phases of the ISM. We model the most
important far-infrared (FIR) emission lines throughout cosmic time back to
$z=6$ with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We study how different
physical parameters, such as the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and
metallicity, impact the ISM phases traced by FIR line luminosities and connect
those with the star-formation rate (SFR). We implement a physically motivated
multi-phase model of the ISM by post-processing EAGLE cosmological simulation
with Cloudy look-up tables. In this model, we assume four phases of the ISM:
dense molecular gas, neutral atomic gas, diffuse ionised gas (DIG) and HII
regions. Our model shows good agreement with the observed luminosity-SFR
relation up to $z=6$ in the FIR emission lines analysed and we also provide
linear fits. Our predictions also agree with observations in terms of
diagnostic diagrams involving various line ratios. We find that [C II] is the
best SFR tracer of the FIR lines even though it traces multiple ISM phases,
while [O III] and [N II] can be used to understand the DIG-HII balance in the
ionised phase. In addition, line ratios like [C II]/[O III] and [N II/[O I] are
useful to trace parameters such as ISRF, metallicity and specific
star-formation rate. These results help to interpret observations of FIR line
emission from the local Universe to high-$z$ galaxies.

Title:Rossby Wave Instabilities of Protoplanetary Discs with Cooling,"
Abstract:  Rossby wave instabilities (RWIs) usually lead to nonaxisymmetric vortices in
protoplanetary discs and some observed sub-structures of these discs can be
well explained by RWIs. We explore how the cooling influences the growth rate
of unstable RWI modes in terms of the linear perturbation analysis. The cooling
associated with the energy equation is treated in two different ways. The first
one we adopt is a simple cooling law. The perturbed thermal state relaxes to
the initial thermal state on a prescribed cooling timescale. In the second, we
treat the cooling as a thermal diffusion process. The difference in the growth
rate between the adiabatic and isothermal modes becomes more pronounced for
discs with smaller sound speed. For the simple cooling law, the growth rates of
unstable modes monotonically decrease with the shorter cooling timescale in
barotropic discs. But the dependence of growth rate with the cooling timescale
becomes non-monotonic in non-baratopic discs. The RWI might even be enhanced in
non-barotropic discs during the transition from the adiabatic state to the
isothermal state. When the cooling is treated as the thermal diffusion, even in
barotropic disc, the variation of growth rate with thermal diffusivity becomes
non-monotonic. Further more, a maximum growth rate may appear with an
appropriate value of thermal diffusivity. The angular momentum flux (AMF) is
investigated to understand the angular momentum transport by RWI with cooling.

Abstract:  We report the near-infrared radial-velocity (RV) discovery of a super-Earth
planet on a 10.77-day orbit around the M4.5 dwarf Ross 508

(InfraRed Doppler) instrument, we derive a semi-amplitude of
$3.92^{+0.60}_{-0.58}$ ${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$, corresponding to a planet with a
minimum mass $m \sin i = 4.00^{+0.53}_{-0.55}\ M_{\oplus}$. We find no evidence
of significant signals at the detected period in spectroscopic stellar activity
indicators or MEarth photometry. The planet, Ross 508 b, has a semimajor-axis
of $0.05366^{+0.00056}_{-0.00049}$ au. This gives an orbit-averaged insolation
of $\approx$1.4 times the Earth's value, placing Ross 508 b near the inner edge
of its star's habitable zone. We have explored the possibility that the planet
has a high eccentricity and its host is accompanied by an additional
unconfirmed companion on a wide orbit. Our discovery demonstrates that the
near-infrared RV search can play a crucial role to find a low-mass planet
around cool M dwarfs like Ross 508.

Abstract:  Type-I X-ray burst oscillations are powered by thermonuclear released on the
neutron star (NS) surface in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), where the burst
oscillation frequencies are close to the NS spin rates. In this work, we report
the detection of oscillation at 584.65 Hz during the cooling tail of a type-I
X-ray bursts observed from the accreting NS LMXB 4U~1730--22 in 2022 March 20,
by the \textit{ Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer} (\textit{NICER})

confidence levels of $7.05\sigma$ and $4.78\sigma$, respectively. The folded
pulse profile of the oscillation in the 0.2--10 keV band showed a sinusoidal
shape with the fraction amplitude rms of $(12.5\pm1.8)\%$. We found the
oscillation frequency showed insignificant upward drifting, i.e., less than 0.3
Hz, during the cooling tail, similar as the behavior appearing in accreting
millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXP), and indicate the source could be an AMXP

Title:The Transport of Extrusive Volcanic Deposits on Jezero Crater Through Paleofluvial Processes,"
Abstract:  Jezero, an impact crater in the Syrtis Major quadrangle of Mars, is generally
thought to have amassed a large body of liquid water in its ancient past. NASA
spectra of the proposed paleolake interpret the youngest surface unit as
olivine-bearing minerals crystallized from magma. In early 2021, the
Perseverance rover landed at the leading edge of a fan-delta deposit northwest
of Jezero, an area argued to have experienced two distinct periods of fluvial
activity. Surface imagery obtained by Perseverance reveal partially buried and
unburied vesicular and non-vesicular rocks that appear volcanic in origin,
emplaced sometime during the Noachian-Hesperian boundary. The absence of
volcanic extrusive features along the fan-delta deposit, however, have made the
origin of these ballast deposits a matter of contention among planetary
scientists. To establish the origin of these basalt-like rocks, a comparison
was made between analogous deposits on the Moenkopi Plateau in Arizona with
similar deposits imaged by Perseverance on Jezero. The search for geologic
analogs along the Moenkopi Plateau were guided by observable similarities in
surface geomorphology, influenced and modified by fluvial, eolian, and past
volcanic activity, primarily from the Late Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. By
analyzing surface imagery taken by Perseverance and comparing it with the
analogue site, we hypothesize that the exposed vesicular rocks imaged by
Perseverance were likely transported into the paleolake by geomorphic
interactions, specifically fluvial processes similarly to the deposits that
were transported along drainage patterns we observed on the Moenkopi Plateau.

Title:The response of a red supergiant to a common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) impostor event,"
Abstract:  Using a one-dimensional stellar evolution code we simulate the response of a
red supergiant (RSG) star to injection of energy and to mass removal. We take
the values of the energy that we inject and the mass that we remove according
to our previous three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a neutron star
(NS) on a highly eccentric orbit that enters the envelope of an RSG star for
half a year and launches jets as it accretes mass via an accretion disk. We
find that for injected energies of ~1e47-1e48 erg and removed mass of
~0.03-0.6Mo the RSG envelope expands to a large radius. Therefore, we expect
the NS to continue to orbit inside this massive inflated envelope for several
more months, up to about twice the initial RSG radius, to continue to accrete
mass and launch jets for a prolonged period. Although these late jets are
weaker than the jets that the NS launches while inside the original RSG
envelope, the late jets might actually be more influential on the light curve,
leading to a long, several months to few years, and bright, about >10^8Lo,
transient event. The RSG returns to more or less a relaxed structure after
about ten years, and so another transient event might occur in the next
periastron passage of the NS. Our results add to the already rich variety of
jet-driven explosions/outbursts that might account for many puzzling transient
events.

Title:Analysis of the reflection spectra of MAXI J1535-571 in the hard and intermediate states,"
Abstract:  We report results on the joint-fit of the NuSTAR and HXMT data for the black
hole X-ray binary candidate MAXI J1535-571. The observations were obtained in
2017 when the source evolved through the hard, hard-intermediate and
soft-intermediate states over the rising phase of the outburst. After
subtracting continuum components, X-ray reflection signatures are clearly
showed in those observations. By modeling the relativistic reflection in
detail, we find that the inner radius $R_{\rm{in}}$ is relatively stable with
$R_{\rm{in}}\lesssim 1.55 R_{\rm{g}}$ during the three states, which implies
that the inner radius likely extends to the innermost stable circular orbit
even in the bright hard state. When adopting $R_{\rm{in}} = R_{\rm{ISCO}}$, the
spin parameter is constrained to be $0.985_{-0.004}^{+0.002}$ at 90% confidence
(statistical only). The best-fitting results reveal that the inclination of the
inner accretion disc is $\sim70-74$ degrees, which notably conflicts with the
apparent orientation of the ballistic jet ($\leqslant$45 degrees). In addition,
both the photon index and the electron temperature increase during the
transition from hard to soft state. It seems that the corona evolves from dense
low-temperature in the LHS to tenuous high-temperature after the state
transition, which indicates that the state transition is accompanied by the
evolution of the coronal properties.

triggering the oscillations. We investigate periodicities using time-distance,
Fast Fourier Transform, and Wavelet techniques. Despite different excitation
sources in the vicinity of the loops and the changing nature of amplitudes, the
periodicity of multiple oscillations is found to be 4 - 6 minutes.

Abstract:  Polarimetry provides an avenue for probing the geometry and physical

stellar binary systems. We present the results of multiwavelength (BVR)
polarimetric studies of a sample of historical black hole X-ray binaries,
observed during their outbursts or in the quiescent (or near-quiescent) state.
We surveyed both long- and short-period systems, located at different Galactic
latitudes. We performed careful analysis of the interstellar polarization in
the direction on the sources to reliably estimate the intrinsic source
polarization. Intrinsic polarization was found to be small (< 0.2 per cent) in
sources observed in bright soft states (MAXI J0637-430 and 4U 1957+115). It was
found to be significant in the rising hard state of MAXI J1820+070 at the level
of 0.5 per cent and negligible in the decaying hard state and during its failed
outbursts, while Swift J1357.2-0933 showed its absence in the rising hard
state. Three (XTE J1118+480, V4641 Sgr, V404 Cyg) sources observed during
quiescence show no evidence of significant intrinsic polarization, while MAXI
J1820+070 is the only black hole X-ray binary which showed substantial (> 5 per
cent) intrinsic quiescent-state polarization with a blue spectrum. The absence
of intrinsic polarization at the optical wavelengths puts constraints on the
potential contribution of non-stellar (jet, hot flow, accretion disc)
components to the total spectra of quiescent black hole X-ray binaries.

Abstract:  In this work, the temporal and spectral properties of the poorly studied
X-ray pulsar Swift J1808.4$-$1754 were investigated in the 0.8-79 keV energy
range based on the data from the NuSTAR and Swift observatories collected
during the 2014 outburst. Strong pulsations with a period of $909.73\pm0.03$ s
were detected in the source light curve, with the pulsed fraction demonstrating
a nonmonotonic dependence on the energy with a local minimum around 17-22 keV.
Phase lags in one of the pulse profile components, reaching the maximal value
approximately at the same energy, were discovered. The pulse phase-averaged
spectrum of the source has a power-law shape with an exponential cutoff at high
energies, which is typical of X-ray pulsars. Pulse phase-resolved spectroscopy
revealed the presence of a pulse phase-transient cyclotron absorption line at
$\sim$21 keV, allowing us to estimate the neutron star magnetic field of
$2.4\times10^{12}$ G. This makes Swift J1808.4$-$1754 a member of very small
family of X-ray pulsars with a pulse-phase-transient cyclotron line in a narrow
phase range. The data from the Nordic Optical Telescope allowed us to study the
properties of the IR companion in the system and to conclude that most probably
it is a Be-type star located at a distance of 5-8 kpc.

Title:Gamma-ray bursts afterglow physics and the VHE domain,"
Abstract:  Afterglow radiation in gamma-ray bursts (GRB), extending from the radio band
to GeV energies, is produced as a result of the interaction between the
relativistic jet and the ambient medium. Although in general the origin of the
emission is robustly identified as synchrotron radiation from the
shock-accelerated electrons, many aspects remain poorly constrained, such as
the role of inverse Compton emission, the particle acceleration mechanism, the
properties of the environment and of the GRB jet itself. The extension of the
afterglow emission into the TeV band has been discussed and theorized for
years, but has eluded for a long time the observations. Recently the Cherenkov
telescopes MAGIC and H.E.S.S. have unequivocally proven that afterglow
radiation is produced also above $100$\,GeV, up to at least a few TeV. The
accessibility of the TeV spectral window will largely improve with the upcoming
facility CTA ({the} Cherenkov Telescope Array). In this review article, we
first revise the current model for afterglow emission in GRBs, its limitations
and open issues. Then we describe the recent detections of very high energy
emission from GRBs and the origin of this radiation. Implications on the
understanding of afterglow radiation and constraints on the physics of the
involved processes will be deeply investigated, showing how future
observations, especially {by} the CTA Observatory, are expected to give a key
contribution in improving our comprehension of such elusive sources.

Abstract:  Recent observations have shown that the atmospheres of ultra hot Jupiters
(UHJs) commonly possess temperature inversions, where the temperature increases
with increasing altitude. Nonetheless, which opacity sources are responsible
for the presence of these inversions remains largely observationally
unconstrained. We used LBT/PEPSI to observe the atmosphere of the UHJ KELT-20 b
in both transmission and emission in order to search for molecular agents which
could be responsible for the temperature inversion. We validate our methodology
by confirming a previous detection of Fe I in emission at $15.1\sigma$;
however, we are unable to reproduce published detections of Fe II, Cr I, or Si
I. We attribute the non-detection of Si I to the lack of lines in our bandpass,
but the non-detections of Fe II and Cr I are puzzling due to our much higher
signal-to-noise ratio than previous works. Our search for the inversion agents
TiO, VO, FeH, and CaH results in non-detections. Using injection-recovery
testing we set $4\sigma$ upper limits upon the volume mixing ratios for these
constituents as low as $\sim1\times10^{-10}$ for TiO. For TiO, VO, and CaH, our
limits are much lower than expectations from an equilibrium chemical model,
while FeH is lower than the expectations only from a super-Solar metallicity
model. We thus rule out TiO, VO, and CaH as the source of the temperature
inversion in KELT-20 b, while FeH is disfavored only if KELT-20 b possesses a
high-metallicity atmosphere.

$0.2 < z < 0.8$ groups. We use new UV data from the UVCANDELS project in

properties of the group galaxies from the zCOSMOS 20k Group Catalog. Limiting
our analysis to a complete sample of log$(M_*/M_{\odot})>10.56$ group galaxies
we find that the probability of being quenched increases slowly with decreasing
redshift, diverging from the stagnant field galaxy population. A corresponding
analysis on how the probability of being quenched increases with time within
groups suggests that the dominant environmental quenching process is
characterized by slow ($\sim$Gyr) timescales. We find a quenching time of
approximately $4.91^{+0.91}_{-1.47} $Gyrs, consistent with the slow processes
of strangulation (Larson et al. 1980) and delayed-then-rapid quenching (Wetzel

resolution (R$\sim$50) blue photometer (BP) and red photometer (RP) spectra
will allow for the estimation of stellar atmospheric parameters such as
effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity. We create mock Gaia
BP/RP spectra and use Fisher information matrices to probe the resolution limit
of stellar parameter measurements using BP/RP spectra. The best-case scenario
uncertainties that this analysis provides are then used to produce a
mock-observed stellar population in order to evaluate the false positive rate
(FPR) of identifying extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars. We conclude that the
community will be able to confidently identify metal-poor stars at magnitudes
brighter than $G = 16$ using BP/RP spectra. At fainter magnitudes true
detections will start to be overwhelmed by false positives. When adopting the
commonly-used $G < 14$ limit for metal-poor star searches, we find a FPR for
the low-metallicity regimes [Fe/H] $<$ -2, -2.5 and -3 of just 14$\%$, 33$\%$
and 56$\%$ respectively, offering the potential for significant improvements on
previous targeting campaigns. Additionally, we explore the chemical sensitivity
obtainable directly from BP/RP spectra for Carbon and $\alpha$-elements. We
find an absolute Carbon abundance uncertainty of $\sigma_{A(C)} < 1$ dex for
Carbon-enriched metal-poor (CEMP) stars, indicating the potential to identify a
CEMP stellar population for follow-up confirmation with higher resolution
spectroscopy. Finally, we find that large uncertainties in $\alpha$-element
abundance measurements using BP/RP spectra means that efficiently obtaining
these abundances will be challenging.

cluster) orbiting SgrA$^*$, which were recently reported to be arranged in two
orthogonal disks. In this case, the timescale for Lense-Thirring precession of
S-stars should be longer than their age, implying a low spin for SgrA$^*$. In
contrast, the recent results by the Event Horizon Telescope favor a
highly-spinning SgrA$^*$, which seem to suggest that the S-stars could not be
arranged in disks. Alternatively, the spin of SgrA$^*$ must be small,
suggesting that the models for its observed image are incomplete.

Title:A structure function analysis of VST-COSMOS AGN,"
Abstract:  We present our sixth work in a series dedicated to variability studies of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on the survey of the COSMOS field by the VLT
Survey Telescope (VST). Its 54 r-band visits over 3.3 yr and single-visit depth
of 24.6 r-band mag make this dataset a valuable scaled-down version that can
help forecast the performance of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space
and Time (LSST). This work is centered on the analysis of the structure
function (SF) of VST-COSMOS AGN, investigating possible differences in its
shape and slope related to how the AGN were selected, and explores possible
connections between the ensemble variability of AGN and black-hole mass,
accretion rate, bolometric luminosity, redshift, and obscuration of the source.
Given its features, our dataset opens up the exploration of samples ~2 mag
fainter than most of the literature to date. We identify several samples of AGN
- 677 in total - obtained by a variety of selection techniques which partly
overlap. Our analysis compares results for the various samples. We split each
sample in two based on the median of the physical property of interest, and
analyze differences in the shape and slope of the SF, and possible causes.
While the shape of the SF does not change with depth, it is highly affected by
the type of AGN (unobscured/obscured) included in the sample. Where a linear
region can be identified, we find that the variability amplitude anticorrelates
with accretion rate and bolometric luminosity, consistent with previous
literature on the topic, while no dependence on black-hole mass emerges from
this study. With its longer baseline and denser and more regular sampling, the
LSST will allow an improved characterization of the SF and its dependencies on
the mentioned physical properties over much larger AGN samples.

Title:The Gamma-Ray Emission from the Supernova Remnant RX J1713.7-3946 Interacting with Two-phase Medium,"
Abstract:  We study the origin of gamma rays from the supernova remnant (SNR) RX
J1713.7-3946. Using an analytical model, we calculate the distribution of
cosmic rays (CRs) around the SNRs. Motivated by the results of previous
studies, we assume that the SNR is interacting with two-phase interstellar
medium (ISM), where dense clumps are surrounded by tenuous interclump medium.
We also assume that only higher-energy protons (~> TeV) can penetrate the dense
clumps. We find that pi^0-decay gamma rays produced by protons reproduce the
observed gamma-ray spectrum peaked at ~TeV. On the other hand, it has recently
been indicated that the observed ISM column density (N_p), the X-ray surface
brightness (I_X), and the gamma-ray surface brightness (I_g) at grid points
across the SNR form a plane in the three-dimensional (3D) space of (N_p, I_X,
I_g). We find that the planar configuration is naturally reproduced if the ISM
or the CR electron-to-proton ratio is not spherically uniform. We show that the
shift of the observed data in the 3D space could be used to identify which of
the quantities, the ISM density, the CR electron-to-proton ratio, or the
magnetic field, varies in the azimuthal direction of the SNR.

Title:Mapping Dark Matter with Extragalactic Stellar Streams: the Case of Centaurus A,"
Abstract:  In the coming decade, thousands of stellar streams will be observed in the
halos of external galaxies. What fundamental discoveries will we make about
dark matter from these streams? As a first attempt to look at these questions,
we model Magellan/Megacam imaging of the Centaurus A's (Cen A) disrupting dwarf
companion Dwarf 3 (Dw3) and its associated stellar stream, to find out what can
be learned about the Cen A dark-matter halo. We develop a novel external galaxy
stream-fitting technique and generate model stellar streams that reproduce the
stream morphology visible in the imaging. We find that there are many viable
stream models that fit the data well, with reasonable parameters, provided that
Cen A has a halo mass larger than M$_{200}$ $>4.70\times 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$.
There is a second stream in Cen A's halo that is also reproduced within the
context of this same dynamical model. However, stream morphology in the imaging
alone does not uniquely determine the mass or mass distribution for the Cen A
halo. In particular, the stream models with high likelihood show covariances
between the inferred Cen A mass distribution, the inferred Dw3 progenitor mass,
the Dw3 velocity, and the Dw3 line-of-sight position. We show that these
degeneracies can be broken with radial-velocity measurements along the stream,
and that a single radial velocity measurement puts a substantial lower limit on
the halo mass. These results suggest that targeted radial-velocity measurements
will be critical if we want to learn about dark matter from extragalactic
stellar streams.

Title:Revealing the Milky Way's Most Recent Major Merger with a Gaia EDR3 Catalog of Machine-Learned Line-of-Sight Velocities,"
Abstract:  Machine learning can play a powerful role in inferring missing line-of-sight
velocities from astrometry in surveys such as Gaia. In this paper, we apply a
neural network to Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) and obtain line-of-sight
velocities and associated uncertainties for ~92 million stars. The network,
which takes as input a star's parallax, angular coordinates, and proper
motions, is trained and validated on ~6.4 million stars in Gaia with complete
phase-space information. The network's uncertainty on its velocity prediction
is a key aspect of its design; by properly convolving these uncertainties with
the inferred velocities, we obtain accurate stellar kinematic distributions. As
a first science application, we use the new network-completed catalog to
identify candidate stars that belong to the Milky Way's most recent major
merger, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). We present the kinematic, energy, angular
momentum, and spatial distributions of the ~450,000 GSE candidates in this
sample, and also study the chemical abundances of those with cross matches to
GALAH and APOGEE. The network's predictive power will only continue to improve
with future Gaia data releases as the training set of stars with complete
phase-space information grows. This work provides a first demonstration of how
to use machine learning to exploit high-dimensional correlations on data to
infer line-of-sight velocities, and offers a template for how to train,
validate and apply such a neural network when complete observational data is
not available.

"Title:High Cadence TESS and ground-based data of SN 2019esa, the less energetic sibling of SN 2006gy","
Abstract:  We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby
($D\approx28$ Mpc) interacting supernova (SN) 2019esa, discovered within hours
of explosion and serendipitously observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS). Early, high cadence light curves from both TESS and the DLT40
survey tightly constrain the time of explosion, and show a 30 day rise to
maximum light followed by a near constant linear decline in luminosity. Optical
spectroscopy over the first 40 days revealed a highly reddened object with
narrow Balmer emission lines seen in Type IIn supernovae. The slow rise to
maximum in the optical lightcurve combined with the lack of broad H$\alpha$
emission suggest the presence of very optically thick and close circumstellar
material (CSM) that quickly decelerated the supernova ejecta. This CSM was
likely created from a massive star progenitor with an $\dot{M}$ $\sim$ 0.3
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ lost in a previous eruptive episode 3--4 years before
eruption, similar to giant eruptions of luminous blue variable stars. At late
times, strong intermediate-width Ca II, Fe I, and Fe II lines are seen in the
optical spectra, identical to those seen in the superluminous interacting SN
2006gy. The strong CSM interaction masks the underlying explosion mechanism in
SN 2019esa, but the combination of the luminosity, strength of the H$\alpha$
lines, and mass loss rate of the progenitor all point to a core collapse
origin.

Title:Validation of strategies for coupling exoplanet PSFs into single-mode fibres for high-dispersion coronagraphy,"
Abstract:  On large ground-based telescopes, the combination of extreme adaptive optics
(ExAO) and coronagraphy with high-dispersion spectroscopy (HDS), sometimes
referred to as high-dispersion coronagraphy (HDC), is starting to emerge as a
powerful technique for the direct characterisation of giant exoplanets. The
high spectral resolution not only brings a major gain in terms of accessible
spectral features but also enables a better separation of the stellar and
planetary signals. Ongoing projects such as Keck/KPIC, Subaru/REACH, and
VLT/HiRISE base their observing strategy on the use of a few science fibres,
one of which is dedicated to sampling the planet's signal, while the others
sample the residual starlight in the speckle field. The main challenge in this
approach is to blindly centre the planet's point spread function (PSF)
accurately on the science fibre, with an accuracy of less than 0.1 $\lambda/D$
to maximise the coupling efficiency. In the context of the HiRISE project,
three possible centring strategies are foreseen, either based on
retro-injecting calibration fibres to localise the position of the science
fibre or based on a dedicated centring fibre. We implemented these three
approaches, and we compared their centring accuracy using an upgraded setup of
the MITHiC high-contrast imaging testbed, which is similar to the setup that
will be adopted in HiRISE. Our results demonstrate that reaching a
specification accuracy of 0.1 $\lambda/D$ is extremely challenging regardless
of the chosen centring strategy. It requires a high level of accuracy at every
step of the centring procedure, which can be reached with very stable
instruments. We studied the contributors to the centring error in the case of
MITHiC and we propose a quantification for some of the most impacting terms.

Title:Particle re-acceleration and diffuse radio sources in the galaxy cluster Abell 1550,"
Abstract:  We study diffuse radio emission in the galaxy cluster A1550, with the aim of
constraining particle re-acceleration in the intra-cluster medium. We exploit
observations at four different frequencies: 54, 144, 400 and 1400 MHz. To
complement our analysis, we make use of archival Chandra X-ray data. At all
frequencies we detect an ultra-steep spectrum radio halo ($S_\nu \propto
\nu^{-1.6}$) with an extent of 1.2 Mpc at 54 MHz. Its morphology follows the
distribution of the thermal intra-cluster medium inferred from the Chandra
observation. West of the centrally located head-tail radio galaxy, we detect a
radio relic with projected extent of 500 kpc. From the relic, a 600 kpc long
bridge departs and connect it to the halo. Between the relic and the radio
galaxy, we observe what is most likely a radio phoenix, given its curved
spectrum. The phoenix is connected to the tail of the radio galaxy through two
arms, which show a nearly constant spectral index for 300 kpc. The halo could
be produced by turbulence induced by a major merger, with its axis lying in the
NE-SW direction. This is supported by the position of the relic, whose origin
could be attributed to a shock propagating along the merger axis. It is
possible that the same shock has also produced the phoenix through adiabatic
compression, while the bridge could be generated by electrons which were
pre-accelerated by the shock, and then re-accelerated by turbulence. Finally,
we detect hints of gentle re-energisation in the two arms which depart from the
tail of the radio galaxy.

Title:Neutrino Emission from Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients,"
Abstract:  Mounting evidence suggests that Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients
(LFBOTs) are powered by a compact object, launching an asymmetric and fast
outflow responsible for the radiation observed in the ultraviolet, optical,
infrared, radio, and X-ray bands. Proposed scenarios aiming to explain the
electromagnetic emission include an inflated cocoon, surrounding a jet choked
in the extended stellar envelope. In alternative, the observed radiation may
arise from the disk formed by the delayed merger of a black hole with a
Wolf-Rayet star. We explore the neutrino production in these scenarios, i.e.
internal shocks in a choked jet and interaction between the outflow and the
circumstellar medium (CSM). If observed on-axis, the choked jet provides the
dominant contribution to the neutrino fluence. Intriguingly, the IceCube upper
limit on the neutrino emission inferred from the closest LFBOT, AT2018cow,
excludes a region of the parameter space otherwise allowed by electromagnetic
observations. After correcting for the Eddington bias on the observation of
cosmic neutrinos, we conclude that the emission from an on-axis choked jet and
CSM interaction is compatible with the detection of two track-like neutrino
events observed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in coincidence with
AT2018cow, and otherwise considered to be of atmospheric origin. While the
neutrino emission from LFBOTs does not constitute the bulk of the diffuse
background of neutrinos observed by IceCube, detection prospects of nearby
LFBOTs with IceCube and the upcoming IceCube-Gen2 are encouraging. Follow-up
neutrino searches will be crucial for unravelling the mechanism powering this
emergent transient class.

Title:First experimental confirmation of the CH3O + H2CO -> CH3OH + HCO reaction: expanding the CH3OH formation mechanism in interstellar ices,"
Abstract:  The successive addition of H atoms to CO in the solid phase has been hitherto
regarded as the primary route to form methanol in dark molecular clouds.
However, recent Monte Carlo simulations of interstellar ices alternatively
suggested the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction reaction CH3O + H2CO -> CH3OH
+ HCO, in addition to CH3O + H -> CH3OH, as a very promising and possibly
dominating (70 - 90 %) final step to form CH3OH in those environments. Here, we
compare the contributions of these two steps leading to methanol by
experimentally investigating hydrogenation reactions on H2CO and D2CO ices,
which ensures comparable starting points between the two scenarios. The
experiments are performed under ultrahigh vacuum conditions and astronomically
relevant temperatures, with H:H2CO (or D2CO) flux ratios of 10:1 and 30:1. The
radical-molecule route in the partially deuterated scenario, CHD2O + D2CO ->
CHD2OD + DCO, is significantly hampered by the isotope effect in the
D-abstraction process, and can thus be used as an artifice to probe the
efficiency of this step. We observe a significantly smaller yield of D2CO + H
products in comparison to H2CO + H, implying that the CH3O-induced abstraction
route must play an important role in the formation of methanol in interstellar
ices. Reflection-Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy (RAIRS) and Temperature
Programmed Desorption-Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (TPD-QMS) analyses are used
to quantify the species in the ice. Both analytical techniques indicate
constant contributions of ~80 % for the abstraction route in the 10 - 16 K
interval, which agrees well with the Monte Carlo conclusions. Additional H2CO +
D experiments confirm these conclusions.

Title:Coordinated time variability of multi-phase ultra-fast outflows in J132216.25+052446.3,"
Abstract:  We present a time variability analysis of broad absorption lines (BAL; spread
over the velocity range of 5800-29000 km/s) seen in the spectrum of
J132216.25+052446.3 (z(em)= 2.04806) at ten different epochs spanning over 19
years. The strongest absorption component (BAL-A; spread over 5800-9900 km/s)
is made up of several narrow components having velocity separations close to C
IV doublet splitting. The C IV, N V, and Si IV absorption from BAL-A show
correlated optical depth variability without significant changes in the
velocity structure. A very broad and shallow absorption (BAL-C; spread over the
velocity range 15000-29000 km/s) emerged during our monitoring period
coinciding with a dimming episode of J1322+0524. All the identified absorption
lines show correlated variability with the equivalent widths increasing with
decreasing flux. This together with the C IV emission-line variability is
consistent with ionization being the main driver of the correlated variability.
The observed UV-continuum variations are weaker than what is required by the
photo-ionization models. This together with a scatter in the C iv equivalent
width at a given continuum flux can be understood if variations of the C IV
ionizing photons are much larger than that of the UV continuum, the variations
in the ionizing photon and UV fluxes are not correlated and/or the covering
factor of the flow varies continuously. We suggest BAL-A is produced by a
stable clumpy outflow located beyond the broad emission line region and BAL-C
is a newly formed wind component located near the accretion disk and both
respond to changes in the ionizing continuum.

Title:Magnetic field structure in the vicinity of a super-massive black hole in low luminosity galaxies: the case of Sgr A*,"
Abstract:  Observations of $\rm SgrA^*$ have provided a lot of insight on low-luminosity
accretion, with a handful of bright flares accompanied with orbital motion
close to the horizon. It has been proposed that gas supply comes from stellar
winds in the neighborhood of the supermassive black hole. We here argue that
the flow at the vicinity of the black hole has a low magnetization and a
structure of alternating polarity totally dictated by the well studied and
long-ago proposed MRI turbulent process. This can be the case, provided that in
larger distances from the black hole magnetic diffusivity is dominant and thus
the magnetic field will never reach equipartition values. For $\rm SgrA^*$, we
show the immediate consequences of this specific magnetic field geometry, which
are: (i) an intermittent flow that passes from quiescent states to flaring
activity, (ii) no quasi-steady-state jet, (iii) no possibility of a
magnetically arrested configuration. Moreover a further distinctive feature of
this geometry is the intense magnetic reconnection events, occurring as layers
of opposite magnetic polarity are accreted, in the vicinity of the black hole.
Finally, we argue that the absence of a jet structure in such case will be a
smoking gun in 43 \& 86 GHz observations.

Title:Comparing energy and entropy formulations for cosmic ray hydrodynamics,"
Abstract:  Cosmic rays (CRs) play an important role in many astrophysical systems.
Acting on plasma scales to galactic environments, CRs are usually modeled as a
fluid, using the CR energy density as the evolving quantity. This method comes
with the flaw that the corresponding CR evolution equation is not in
conservative form as it contains an adiabatic source term that couples CRs to
the thermal gas. In the absence of non-adiabatic changes, instead evolving the
CR entropy density is a physically equivalent option that avoids this potential
numerical inconsistency. In this work, we study both approaches for evolving
CRs in the context of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using the
massively parallel moving-mesh code AREPO. We investigate the performance of
both methods in a sequence of shock-tube tests with various resolutions and
shock Mach numbers. We find that the entropy-conserving scheme performs best
for the idealized case of purely adiabatic CRs across the shock while both
approaches yield similar results at lower resolution. In this setup, both
schemes operate well and almost independently of the shock Mach number. Taking
active CR acceleration at the shock into account, the energy-based method
proves to be numerically much more stable and significantly more accurate in
determining the shock velocity, in particular at low resolution, which is more
typical for astrophysical large-scale simulations. For a more realistic
application, we simulate the formation of several isolated galaxies at
different halo masses and find that both numerical methods yield almost
identical results with differences far below common astrophysical
uncertainties.

Title:Evolution of Massive Black Hole Binaries in Collisionally Relaxed Nuclear Star Clusters -- Impact of Mass Segregation,"
Abstract:  Massive Black Hole (MBH) binaries are considered to be one of the most
important sources of Gravitational Waves (GW) that can be detected by GW
detectors like LISA. However, there are a lot of uncertainties in the dynamics
of MBH binaries in the stages leading up to the GW-emission phase. It has been
recently suggested that Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs) could provide a viable
route to overcome the final parsec problem for MBH binaries at the center of
galaxies. NSCs are collisional systems where the dynamics would be altered by
the presence of a mass spectrum. In this study, we use a suite of $N$-body
simulations to understand how collisional relaxation under the presence of a
mass spectrum of NSC particles affects the dynamics of the MBH binary under the
merger of two NSCs. To understand the differences, we consider MBH binaries
with different mass ratios and additional non-relaxed models. We find that
mass-segregation driven by collisional relaxation can lead to accelerated
hardening in lower mass ratio binaries but has the opposite effect in higher
mass ratio binaries.The relaxed models demonstrate a lower mass density
compared to the non-relaxed models within the influence radius and higher
density only very close to the MBH which leads to a less efficient orbital
decay in higher mass-ratio models. The results are robust and highlight the
importance of subtle differences in changing the dynamics of the binary. Our
models are fully collisional and use high enough particle numbers to model NSCs
realistically.

Title:Gamma-rays from the circumgalactic medium of M31,"
Abstract:  We discuss the production of $\gamma$-rays from cosmic rays (CR) in the
circumgalactic medium (CGM) of Andromeda (M31) in light of the recent detection
of $\gamma$-rays from an annular region of $\sim 5.5-120$ kpc away from the M31
disc. We consider the CRs accelerated as a result of the star-formation in the
M31 disk, which are lifted to the CGM by advection due to outflow and CR
diffusion. The advection time scale due to bulk flow of gas triggered by star
formation activity in the M31 disc is comparable ($\sim$ Gyr) to the diffusion
time scale with diffusion coefficient $\ge10^{29}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ for the
propagation of CR protons with energy $\sim 412$ GeV that are responsible for
the highest energy photons observed. We show that a leptonic origin of the
$\gamma$-rays from cosmic ray (CR) electrons has difficulties, as the inverse
Compton time scale ($\sim$Myr) is much lower than advection time scale
($\sim$Gyr) to reach $120$ kpc. Invoking CR electrons accelerated by accretion
shocks in the CGM at $\sim100-120$ kpc does not help since it would lead to
diffuse X-ray features that are not observed. We, therefore, study the
production of $\gamma$-rays via hadronic interaction between CR protons and CGM
gas with the help of numerical two-fluid (thermal + CR) hydrodynamical
simulation. We find that a combination of these mechanisms, that are related to
the star formation processes in M31 in the last $\sim $ Gyr, along with
diffusion and hadronic interaction, can explain the observed flux from the CGM
of M31.

Title:Dynamical evolution of a self-gravitating planetesimal disk in the distant trans-Neptunian region,"
Abstract:  Aims. We study the dynamical evolution of a system consisting of the giant
planets and a massive planetesimal disk over the age of the Solar System. The
main question addressed in this study is whether distant trans-Neptunian
objects could have come about as a result of the combined action of planetary
perturbations and the self-gravity of the disk. Methods. We carried out a
series of full N-body numerical simulations of gravitational interactions
between the giant planets and a massive outer disk of planetesimals. Results.
Our simulations show that the collective gravity of the giant planets and
massive planetesimals produces distant trans-Neptunian objects across a wide
range of the initial disk mass. The majority of objects that survive up through
the age of the Solar System have perihelion distances of q > 40 au. In this
region, there is a tendency toward a slow decrease in eccentricities and an
increase in perihelion distances for objects with semimajor axes a > 150 au.
Secular resonances between distant planetesimals play a major role in
increasing their perihelion distances. This explains the origin of Sedna-type
objects. In our integrations for the age of the Solar System, we registered
times with both high and low clustering of longitudes of perihelion and
arguments of perihelion for objects with q > 40 au, a > 150 au. The resulting
distribution of inclinations in our model and the observed distribution of
inclinations for distant trans-Neptunian objects have similar average values of
around 20 degrees. Conclusions. Distant trans-Neptunian objects are a natural
consequence in the models that include migrating giant planets and a
self-gravitating planetesimal disk.

Title:Which black hole formed first? Mass-ratio reversal in massive binary stars from gravitational-wave data,"
Abstract:  Population inference of gravitational-wave catalogues is a useful tool to
translate observations of black-hole mergers into constraints on compact-binary
formation. Different formation channels predict identifiable signatures in the
astrophysical distributions of source parameters, such as masses and spins. One
example within the scenario of isolated binary evolution is mass-ratio
reversal: even assuming efficient core-envelope coupling in massive stars and
tidal spin-up of the stellar companion by the first-born black hole, a compact
binary with a lighter, non-spinning first-born black hole and a heavier,
spinning second-born black hole can still form through mass transfer from the
initially more to less massive progenitor. Using current LIGO/Virgo
observations, we measure the fraction of sources in the underlying population
with this mass-spin combination and interpret it as a constraint on the
occurrence of mass-ratio reversal in massive binary stars. We modify commonly
used population models by including negligible-spin subpopulations and, most
crucially, non-identical component spin distributions. We do not find evidence
for subpopulations of black holes with negligible spins and measure the
fraction of massive binary stars undergoing mass-ratio reversal to be
consistent with zero and $<32\%$ ($99\%$ confidence). The dimensionless spin
peaks around $0.2\unicode{x2013}0.3$ appear robust, however, and are yet to be
explained by progenitor formation scenarios.

Title:CHANG-ES XXIX: The Sub-kpc Nuclear Bubble of NGC 4438,"
Abstract:  AGN bubbles could play an important role in accelerating high-energy CRs and
galactic feedback. Only in nearby galaxies could we have high enough angular
resolution in multi-wavelengths to study the sub-kpc environment of the AGN,
where the bubbles are produced and strongly interact with the surrounding ISM.
In this paper, we present the latest Chandra observations of the Virgo cluster
galaxy NGC 4438, which hosts multi-scale bubbles detected in various bands. The
galaxy also has low current star formation activity, so these bubbles are
evidently produced by the AGN rather than a starburst. We present spatially
resolved spectral analysis of the Chandra data of the
$\sim3^{\prime\prime}\times5^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim200{\rm~pc}\times350\rm~pc$)
nuclear bubble of NGC 4438. The power law tail in the X-ray spectra can be most
naturally explained as synchrotron emission from high-energy CR leptons. The
hot gas temperature increases, while the overall contribution of the
non-thermal X-ray emission decreases with the vertical distance from the
galactic plane. We calculate the synchrotron cooling timescale of the CR
leptons responsible for the non-thermal hard X-ray emission to be only a few
tens to a few hundreds of years. The thermal pressure of the hot gas is about
three times the magnetic pressure, but the current data cannot rule out the
possibility that they are still in pressure balance. The spatially resolved
spectroscopy presented in this paper may have important constraints on how the
AGN accelerates CRs and drives outflows. We also discover a transient X-ray
source only $\sim5^{\prime\prime}$ from the nucleus of NGC 4438. The source was
not detected in 2002 and 2008, but became quite X-ray bright in March 2020,
with an average 0.5-7 keV luminosity of $\sim10^{39}\rm~ergs~s^{-1}$.

2019, we detected 5 new FRBs, and interferometrically localised each of these
to 0.4--10 sq. arcmin. All detections are broad band and very narrow, of order
1 ms duration, and unscattered. Dispersion measures are generally high. Only
through the very high time and frequency resolution of ARTS are these
hard-to-find FRBs detected, producing an unbiased view of the intrinsic
population properties. Most localisation regions are small enough to rule out
the presence of associated persistent radio sources. Three FRBs cut through the
halos of M31 and M33. We demonstrate that Apertif can localise one-off FRBs
with an accuracy that maps magneto-ionic material along well-defined lines of
sight. The rate of 1 every ~7 days next ensures a considerable number of new
sources are detected for such study. The combination of detection rate and
localisation accuracy exemplified by the 5 first ARTS FRBs thus marks a new
phase in which a growing number of bursts can be used to probe our Universe.

Title:The Impact of Resolution on Double-Detonation Models for Type Ia Supernovae,"
Abstract:  Thermonuclear supernovae are the result of the violent unbinding of a white
dwarf, but the precise nature of the explosion mechanism(s) is a matter of
active debate. To this end, several specific scenarios have been proposed to
explain the observable traits of SNe Ia. A promising pathway is the
double-detonation scenario, where a white dwarf accretes a shell of helium-rich
material from a companion and a detonation in the resulting helium shell is the
primary cause of the explosion. Through a set of two-dimensional grid-based
simulations of this scenario we clearly distinguish three phases of evolution:
external helium-rich detonation, core compressive heating, and a final core
carbon burn. Though final disruption of the whole system is achieved at all
resolutions, only models with minimum resolutions of 4~km and better exhibit
all three phases. Particularly, core compression heating is only observed for
higher resolutions, producing qualitatively different nucleosynthetic outcomes.
We identify the effect of finer spatial resolution on the mixing of hot silicon
at the interface between the detonating helium layer and the underlying C/O WD
as a primary driver of these dynamic differences.

Title:The interacting pair of galaxies Arp 82: Integral field spectroscopy and numerical simulations,"
Abstract:  Spectral data cubes of the interacting pair of galaxies NGC 2535 and NGC 2536
(the Arp 82 system) targeting bright emission lines in the visible band,
obtained with the imaging Fourier transform spectrometer (iFTS) SITELLE
attached to the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), are presented. Analysis
of H$\upalpha$ velocity maps reveals a bar in $\rm NGC\,2536$. In $\rm
NGC\,2535$, we find strong non-circular motions outside the ocular ring, in the
elliptical arc and tidal tails of $\rm NGC\,2535$ and a misalignment between
the kinematic and photometric position angles. We detect 155 HII region
complexes in the interacting pair of galaxies and determine oxygen abundances
for 66 of them using different calibrators. We find, regardless of the
indicator used, that the oxygen abundance distribution in $\rm NGC\,2536$ is
shallow whereas, in $\rm NGC\,2535$, it is best fitted by two slopes, the break
occurring beyond the ocular ring. The inner slope is comparable to the one
observed in isolated normal star-forming galaxies but the outer slope is
shallow. We present a numerical simulation of the interaction that reproduces
the observed tidal features, kinematics, and metallicity distribution, to
investigate the effect of the interaction on the galaxies. The model indicates
that the galaxies have undergone a close encounter, strongly prograde for the
primary, and are half way in their course to a second close encounter.

Title:The 2022 Encounter of the Outburst Material from Comet 73P/Schwassmann--Wachmann~3,"
Abstract:  The encounter of the meteoric material from 73P/Schmassmann--Wachmann~3
produced during the comet's 1995 outburst in May 2022 provides a rare and
valuable opportunity to understand a fragmenting comet. Here we explore various
ejection configurations and their impact on the meteor outburst detected in the
early hours of UT 2022 May 31. We show that the dust must have been ejected
$\sim4$ to $5\times$ faster than calculated by water-ice sublimation model to
best match the observed meteor activity. As only a small subset of particles
with a narrow range of cross-section is expected to have reached the Earth, the
large spread of meteor brightness likely indicates the presence of large but
porous meteoroids in the trail. Other effects such as an enhanced lunar sodium
tail and a visible glow from the meteoroid trail may have also occurred during
the encounter.

Title:Statistical properties and correlation length in star-forming molecular clouds: I. Formalism and application to observations,"
Abstract:  The proper characterization of the general statistical behavior of these
fluctuations, from a limited sample of observations or simulations, is of prime
importance to understand the process of star formation. In this article, we use
the ergodic theory for any random field of fluctuations, as commonly used in
statistical physics, to derive rigorous statistical results. We outline how to
evaluate the autocovariance function (ACF) and the characteristic correlation
length of these fluctuations. We then apply this statistical approach to
astrophysical systems characterized by a field of density fluctuations, notably
star-forming clouds. When it is difficult to determine the correlation length
from the empirical ACF, we show alternative ways to estimate the correlation
length. We show that the statistics of the column-density field is hampered by
biases introduced by integration effects along the line of sight and we explain
how to reduce these biases. The statistics of the probability density function
(PDF) ergodic estimator also yields the derivation of the proper statistical
error bars. We provide a method that can be used by observers and numerical
simulation specialists to determine the latter. We show that they (i) cannot be
derived from simple Poisson statistics and (ii) become increasingly large for
increasing density contrasts, severely hampering the accuracy of the low and
high end part of the PDF because of a sample size that is too small. As
templates of various stages of star formation in MCs, we then examine the case
of the Polaris and Orion B clouds in detail. We calculate, from the
observations, the ACF and the correlation length in these clouds and show that
the latter is on the order of $\sim$1\% of the size of the cloud.

Title:Statistical properties and correlation length in star-forming molecular clouds: II. Gravitational potential and virial parameter,"
Abstract:  In the first article of this series, we have used the ergodic theory to
assess the validity of a statistical approach to characterize various
properties of star-forming molecular clouds (MCs) from a limited number of
observations or simulations. This allows the proper determination of confidence
intervals for various volumetric averages of statistical quantities obtained
form observations or numerical simulations.
In this joint paper, we apply the same formalism to a different kind of
(observational or numerical) study of MCs. Indeed, as observations cannot fully
unravel the complexity of the inner density structure of star forming clouds,
it is important to know whether global observable estimates, such as the total
mass and size of the cloud, can give an accurate estimation of various key
physical quantities that characterize the dynamics of the cloud. Of prime
importance is the correct determination of the total gravitational (binding)
energy and virial parameter of a cloud. We show that, whereas for clouds that
are not in a too advanced stage of star formation, such as Polaris or Orion B,
the knowledge of only their mass and size is sufficient to yield an accurate
determination of the aforementioned quantities from observations (i.e. in real
space). In contrast, we show that this is no longer true for numerical
simulations in a periodic box. We derive a relationship for the ratio of the
virial parameter in these two respective cases.

Title:KMT-2021-BLG-0171Lb and KMT-2021-BLG-1689Lb: Two Microlensing Planets in the KMTNet High-cadence Fields with Followup Observations,"
Abstract:  Follow-up observations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing
events can fully exploit their intrinsic sensitivity to detect extrasolar
planets, especially those with small mass ratios. To make followup more uniform
and efficient, we develop a system, HighMagFinder, based on the real-time data
from the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) to automatically alert
possible ongoing high-magnification events. We started a new phase of follow-up
observations with the help of HighMagFinder in 2021. Here we report the
discovery of two planets in high-magnification microlensing events,
KMT-2021-BLG-0171 and KMT-2021-BLG-1689, which were identified by the
HighMagFinder. We find that both events suffer the ``central-resonant'' caustic
degeneracy. The planet-host mass-ratio is $q\sim4.7\times10^{-5}$ or $q\sim
2.2\times10^{-5}$ for KMT-2021-BLG-0171, and $q\sim2.5\times10^{-4}$ or $q\sim
1.8\times10^{-4}$ for KMT-2021-BLG-1689. Together with two events reported by
Ryu et al. (2022), four cases that suffer such degeneracy have been discovered
in the 2021 season alone, indicating that the degenerate solutions may have
been missed in some previous studies. We also propose a new factor for
weighting the probability of each solution from the phase-space. The resonant
interpretations for the two events are disfavored under this consideration.
This factor can be included in future statistical studies to weight degenerate
solutions.

Title:Slow-Roll Inflation at N3LO,"
Abstract:  The next generation of cosmological observations will be sensitive to small
deviations from a pure power law in the primordial power spectrum of the
curvature perturbations. In the context of slow-roll inflation, these
deviations are expected and correspond to the so-called running of the spectral
index. Their measurement would bring as much information as the discovery of
deviations from scale invariance. However, robust parameter inference requires
to marginalize over any possible higher order uncertainties, which have been,
up to now, not fully determined. We tackle this issue by deriving the
inflationary scalar and tensor slow-roll power spectra at next-to-next-to-next
to leading order (N3LO), fully expanded around an observable pivot wavenumber,
for all single field inflationary models having minimal and non-minimal kinetic
terms. Our result therefore encompasses string-inspired inflationary models
having a varying speed of sound.

Title:Cloud-cloud collision and star formation in G323.18+0.15,"
Abstract:  We studied the cloud-cloud collision candidate G323.18+0.15 based on
signatures of induced filaments, clumps, and star formation. We used archival
molecular spectrum line data from the SEDIGISM $^{13}$CO($J$\,=\,2--1) survey,
from the Mopra southern Galactic plane CO survey, and infrared to radio data
from the GLIMPSE, MIPS, Hi-GAL, and SGPS surveys. Our new result shows that the
G323.18+0.15 complex is 3.55kpc away from us and consists of three cloud
components, G323.18a, G323.18b, and G323.18c. G323.18b shows a perfect U-shape
structure, which can be fully complemented by G323.18a, suggesting a collision
between G323.18a and the combined G323.18bc filamentary structure. One dense
compressed layer (filament) is formed at the bottom of G323.18b, where we
detect a greatly increased velocity dispersion. The bridge with an intermediate
velocity in a position-velocity diagram appears between G323.18a and G323.18b,
which corresponds to the compressed layer. G323.18a plus G323.18b as a whole
are probably not gravitationally bound. This indicates that high-mass star
formation in the compressed layer may have been caused by an accidental event.
The column density in the compressed layer of about $1.36 \times
10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$ and most of the dense clumps and high-mass stars are located
there. The average surface density of classI and classII young stellar objects
(YSOs) inside the G323.18+0.15 complex is much higher than the density in the
surroundings. The timescale of the collision between G323.18a and G323.18b is
$1.59$Myr. This is longer than the typical lifetime of classI YSOs and is
comparable to the lifetime of classII YSOs.

Title:The quadrupole in the local Hubble parameter: first constraints using Type Ia supernova data and forecasts for future surveys,"
Abstract:  The cosmological principle asserts that the Universe looks spatially
homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales. Given the fundamental
implications of the cosmological principle, it is important to empirically test
its validity on various scales. In this paper, we use the Type Ia supernova
(SN~Ia) magnitude-redshift relation, from both the Pantheon and JLA
compilations, to constrain theoretically motivated anisotropies in the Hubble
flow. In particular, we constrain the quadrupole moment in the effective Hubble
parameter and the dipole moment in the effective deceleration parameter. We
find no significant quadrupole term regardless of the redshift frame we use.
Our results are consistent with the theoretical expectation of a quadrupole
moment of a few percent at scales of $\sim 100 h^{-1}$ Mpc. We place an upper
limit of a $\sim 10\%$ quadrupole amplitude relative to the monopole, $H_0$, at
these scales. We find that we can detect a $\sim 7\%$ quadrupole moment at the
5$\sigma$ level, for a forecast low-$z$ sample of 1055 SNe~Ia. We find an
exponentially decaying dipole moment of the deceleration parameter varies in
significance depending on the redshift frame we use. In the heliocentric frame,
as expected, it is detected at $\sim 3 \sigma$ significance. In the rest-frame
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we find a marginal $\sim 2 \sigma$
dipole, however, after applying peculiar velocity corrections, the dipole is
insignificant. Finally, we find the best-fit frame of rest relative to the
supernovae to differ from that of the CMB.

Title:Searching for quasi-periodic oscillations in astrophysical transients using Gaussian processes,"
Abstract:  Analyses of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are important to understanding
the dynamic behaviour in many astrophysical objects during transient events
like gamma-ray bursts, solar flares, magnetar flares and fast radio bursts.
Astrophysicists often search for QPOs with frequency-domain methods such as
(Lomb-Scargle) periodograms, which generally assume power-law models plus some
excess around the QPO frequency. Time-series data can alternatively be
investigated directly in the time domain using Gaussian Process (GP)
regression. While GP regression is computationally expensive in the general
case, the properties of astrophysical data and models allow fast likelihood
strategies. Heteroscedasticity and non-stationarity in data have been shown to
cause bias in periodogram-based analyses. Gaussian processes can take account
of these properties. Using GPs, we model QPOs as a stochastic process on top of
a deterministic flare shape. Using Bayesian inference, we demonstrate how to
infer GP hyperparameters and assign them physical meaning, such as the QPO
frequency. We also perform model selection between QPOs and alternative models
such as red noise and show that this can be used to reliably find QPOs. This
method is easily applicable to a variety of different astrophysical data sets.
We demonstrate the use of this method on a range of short transients: a
gamma-ray burst, a magnetar flare, a magnetar giant flare, and simulated solar
flare data.

"Title:VLBI observations of GRB 201015A, a relatively faint GRB with a hint of Very High Energy gamma-ray emission","
Abstract:  GRB 201015A is a long-duration Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) which was detected at
very high energies (> 100 GeV) using the MAGIC telescopes. If confirmed, this
would be the fifth and least luminous GRB ever detected at this energies. We
performed a radio follow-up of GRB 201015A over twelve different epochs, from
1.4 to 117 days post-burst, with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, e-MERLIN
and the European VLBI Network. We included optical and X-rays observations,
performed with the Multiple Mirror Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory
respectively, together with publicly available data. We detected a point-like
transient, consistent with the position of GRB 201015A until 23 and 47 days
post-burst at 1.5 and 5 GHz, respectively. The source was detected also in both
optical (1.4 and 2.2 days post-burst) and X-ray (8.4 and 13.6 days post-burst)
observations. The multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be explained with
the standard model for a GRB seen on-axis, which expands and decelerates into a
medium with a homogeneous density, while a circumburst medium with a wind-like
profile is disfavoured. Notwithstanding the high resolution provided by the
VLBI, we could not pinpoint any expansion or centroid displacement of the
outflow. If the GRB is seen at the viewing angle which maximises the apparent
velocity, we estimate that the Lorentz factor for the possible proper motion is
$\Gamma_{\alpha}$ < 40 in right ascension and $\Gamma_{\delta}$ < 61 in
declination. On the other hand, if the GRB is seen on-axis, the size of the
afterglow is <5 pc and <16 pc at 25 and 47 days. Finally, the early peak in the
optical light curve suggests the presence of a reverse shock component before
0.01 days from the burst.

Abstract:  We use the spectral lag catalog of 46 short GRBs obtained by Xiao et al

use a power-law model as a function of energy for the intrinsic astrophysical
induced spectral lags. The expansion history of the universe needed for the
evaluation of LIV was obtained in a non-parametric method using cosmic
chronometers. We use Bayesian model comparison to determine if the
aforementioned spectral lags show evidence for LIV as compared to only
astrophysically induced lags. We do any find any evidence for LIV, and obtain
95\% c.l. lower limits for the energy scale of LIV to be $4 \times 10^{15}$ GeV
and $6.8 \times 10^{9}$ GeV for the linear and quadratic LIV models
respectively.

Title:Discovery of faint double-peak Halpha emission in the halo of low redshift galaxies,"
Abstract:  Aiming at the detection of cosmological gas being accreted onto galaxies of
the local Universe, we examined the Halpha emission in the halo of 164 galaxies
in the field of view of the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer Wide survey
(\musew ) with observable Halpha (redshift < 0.42). An exhaustive screening of
the corresponding Halpha images led us to select 118 reliable Halpha emitting
gas clouds. The signals are faint, with a surface brightness of 10**(-17.3 pm
0.3) erg/s/cm2/arcsec2. Through statistical tests and other arguments, we ruled
out that they are created by instrumental artifacts, telluric line residuals,
or high redshift interlopers. Around 38% of the time, the Halpha line profile
shows a double peak with the drop in intensity at the rest-frame of the central
galaxy, and with a typical peak-to-peak separation of the order of pm 200 km/s.
Most line emission clumps are spatially unresolved. The mass of emitting gas is
estimated to be between one and 10**(-3) times the stellar mass of the central
galaxy. The signals are not isotropically distributed; their azimuth tends to
be aligned with the major axis of the corresponding galaxy. The distances to
the central galaxies are not random either. The counts drop at a distance > 50
galaxy radii, which roughly corresponds to the virial radius of the central
galaxy. We explore several physical scenarios to explain this Halpha emission,
among which accretion disks around rogue intermediate mass black holes fit the
observations best.

Title:Detection of eccentric close-binary supermassive black holes with incomplete interferometric data,"
Abstract:  Recent studies have proposed that GRAVITY+ instrument is able to trace the
circular orbit of the subparsec close-binary supermassive black holes
(CB-SMBHs) by measuring the photocentre variation of the hot dust emission.
However, the CB-SMBHs orbit may become highly eccentric throughout the
evolution of these objects, and the orbital period may be far longer than the
observational time baseline. We investigate the problem of detecting the
CB-SMBH with hot dust emission and high eccentricity (eCBSMBH, e=0.5) when the
observed time baselines of their astrometric data and radial velocities are
considerably shorter than the orbital period. The parameter space of the
Keplerian model of the eCBSMBH is large for exploratory purposes. We therefore
applied the Bayesian method to fit orbital elements of the eCBSMBH to combined
radial velocity and astrometric data covering a small fraction of the orbital
period. We estimate that a number of potential eCBSMBH systems within reach of
GRAVITY + will be similar to the number of the planned circular targets. We
show that using observational time baselines that cover ~ 10% of the orbit
increases the possibility of determining the period, eccentricity, and total
mass of an eCBSMBH. When the observational time baseline becomes too short (~
5%), the quality of the retrieved eCBSMBH parameters degrades. We also
illustrate how interferometry may be used to estimate the photo-centre at the
eCBSMBH emission line, which could be relevant for GRAVITY+ successors. Even if
the astrometric signal for eCBSMBH systems is reduced by a factor of
sqrt{1-e^{2}} compared to circular ones, we find that the hot dust emission of
eCBSMBHs can be traced by GRAVITY+ at the elementary level.

Title:Exosphere-Mediated Migration of Volatile Species On Airless Bodies Across the Solar System,"
Abstract:  Surface-bound exospheres facilitate volatile migration across the surfaces of
nearly airless bodies. However, such transport requires that the body can both
form and retain an exosphere. To form a sublimation exosphere requires the
surface of a body to be sufficiently warm for surface volatiles to sublime; to
retain an exosphere, the ballistic escape and photodestruction rates and other
loss mechanisms must be sufficiently low. Here we construct a simple free
molecular model of exospheres formed by volatile desorption/sublimation. We
consider the conditions for forming and retaining exospheres for common
volatile species across the Solar System, and explore how three processes
(desorption/sublimation, ballistic loss, and photodestruction) shape exospheric
dynamics on airless bodies. Our model finds that the CO2 exosphere of Callisto
is too dense to be sustained by impact-delivered volatiles, but could be
maintained by only ~7 hectares of exposed CO2 ice. We predict the peak surface
locations of Callisto's CO2 exosphere along with other Galilean moons, which
could be tested by JUICE observations. Our model finds that to maintain
Iapetus' two-tone appearance, its dark Cassini Regio likely has unresolved
exposures of water ice, perhaps in sub-resolution impact craters, that amount
to up to ~0.06% of its surface. In the Uranian system, we find that the CO2
deposits on Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon are unlikely to have been
delivered via impacts, but are consistent with both a magnetospheric origin or
sourced endogenously. We suggest that exosphere-mediated volatile transport
could produce these moons' leading/trailing CO2 asymmetries, and may be a
seasonal equinox feature that could be largely erased by volatile migration
during the Uranian solstices. We calculate that ~2.4-6.4 mm thick layer of CO2
could migrate about the surface of Uranus' large moons during a seasonal cycle.

Abstract:  The radio/X-ray correlation diagram, for Black Hole X-ray Binaries (BHXBs) in
the hard state, depicts the connection that might exists between the radio jets
and X-ray emitting accretion discs. The current version of the radio/X-ray
correlation diagram shows two populations of BHXBs. These two populations
evolve along two different correlation tracks ($F_{rad}= \kappa F_{x}^{b}$),
namely the standard track and the outliers. Over the past years, the key
question has been to explain the existence of these two tracks. In this paper,
we investigate the impact of the black hole mass on the radio/X-ray correlation
for a sample of 17 BHXBs. We are led to conclude at least one of the following
with full consideration of large uncertainties in mass estimates:(i) Most of
the reported mass estimates of black holes are incorrect or insufficiently
accurate to infer their impact on radio/X-ray correlation diagram. (ii) The
estimated radio luminosities and X-ray luminosites are still not reliable
enough for two reasons. One reason is due to the lack of associated errors in
observational data. Another is that some sources might still transit from one
track to the other. (iii) The mass of BH has a significant influence on which
track, the source belongs to, on a radio/X-ray correlation diagram.

Title:The stellar content of the ROSAT all-sky survey,"
Abstract:  We present and apply a method to identify the stellar content of the ROSAT
all-sky survey (RASS). We performed a crossmatch between the RASS sources and
stellar candidates selected from Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) and estimated
stellar probabilities for every RASS source from the geometric properties of
the match and additional properties, namely the X-ray to G-band flux ratio and
the counterpart distances. A comparison with preliminary detections from the
first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1) show that the positional offsets of the
RASS sources are larger than expected from the uncertainties given in the RASS
catalog. From the RASS sources with reliable positional uncertainties, we
identify 28630 (24.9 %) sources as stellar; this is the largest sample of
stellar X-ray sources to date. Directly from the stellar probabilities, we
estimate the completeness and reliability of the sample to be about 93 % and
confirm this value by comparing it to the identification of randomly shifted
RASS sources, preliminary stellar eRASS1 identifications, and results from a
previous identification of RASS sources. Our stellar RASS sources contain
sources of all spectral types and luminosity classes. According to their
position in the color-magnitude diagram, many stellar RASS sources are young
stars with ages of a few $10^7$ yr or binaries. When plotting the X-ray to
bolometric flux ratio as a function of the color, the onset of convection and
the saturation limit are clearly visible. We note that later-type stars reach
continuously higher $F_X/F_{bol}$ values, which is probably due to more
frequent flaring. The color distribution of the stellar RASS sources clearly
differs from the unrelated background sources. We present the three-dimensional
distribution of the stellar RASS sources that shows a clear increase in the
source density near known stellar clusters.

The best triaxial shape obtained for VS$_2$ has semiaxes a = 339 $\pm$ 5 km, b

ellipsoid could be ~10 km smaller. These results are compatible with the
previous ones determined from the single-chord 2013 and four-chord 2014 stellar
occultations and with the effective diameter and albedo derived from Herschel

compatible with a homogeneous triaxial body in hydrostatic equilibrium, but it
might be a differentiated body and/or might be sustaining some stress. No
secondary features related to rings or material orbiting around VS$_2$ were
detected.

Title:Physical properties of the trans-Neptunian object (38628) Huya from a multi-chord stellar occultation,"
Abstract:  Within our international program to obtain accurate physical properties of
trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) we predicted a stellar occultation by the TNO
(38628) Huya of the star Gaia DR2 4352760586390566400 (mG = 11.5 mag.) for
March 18, 2019. After an extensive observational campaign, we updated the
prediction and it turned out to be favorable to central Europe. Therefore, we
mobilized half a hundred professional and amateur astronomers, and the
occultation was finally detected from 21 telescopes located at 18 sites. This
makes the Huya event one of the best ever observed stellar occultation by a TNO
in terms of the number of chords. We determine accurate size, shape, and
geometric albedo, and we also provide constraints on the density and other
internal properties of this TNO. The 21 positive detections of the occultation
by Huya allowed us to obtain well-separated chords which permitted us to fit an
ellipse for the limb of the body at the moment of the occultation (i.e., the
instantaneous limb) with kilometric accuracy. The projected semi-major and
minor axes of the best ellipse fit obtained using the occultation data are (a',
b') = (217.6 $\pm$ 3.5 km, 194.1 $\pm$ 6.1 km) with a position angle of the
minor axis P' = 55.2 $\pm$ 9.1 degrees. From this fit, the projected
area-equivalent diameter is 411.0 $\pm$ 7.3 km. This diameter is compatible
with the equivalent diameter for Huya obtained from radiometric techniques (D =
406 $\pm$ 16 km). From this instantaneous limb, we obtained the geometric
albedo for Huya (p$\rm_V$ = 0.079 $\pm$ 0.004) and we explored possible 3D
shapes and constraints to the mass density for this TNO. We did not detect the
satellite of Huya through this occultation, but the presence of rings or debris
around Huya is constrained using the occultation data. We also derived an upper
limit for a putative Pluto-like global atmosphere of about p$_{\rm surf}$ = 10
nbar.

Title:Searching for outliers in the Chandra Source Catalog,"
Abstract:  Astronomers are increasingly faced with a deluge of information, and finding
worthwhile targets of study in the sea of data can be difficult. Outlier
identification studies are a method that can be used to focus investigations by
presenting a smaller set of sources that could prove interesting because they
do not follow the trends of the underlying population. We apply a principal
component analysis (PCA) and an unsupervised random forest algorithm (uRF) to
sources from the Chandra Source Catalog v.2 (CSC2). We present 119
high-significance sources that appear in all repeated applications of our
outlier identification algorithm (OIA). We analyse the characteristics of our
outlier sources and cross-match them with the SIMBAD data base. Our outliers
contain several sources that were previously identified as having unusual or
interesting features by studies. This OIA leads to the identification of
interesting targets that could motivate more detailed study.

Title:Constraints on dark matter annihilation and decay from the large-scale structure of the nearby universe,"
Abstract:  Decaying or annihilating dark matter particles could be detected through
gamma-ray emission from the species they decay or annihilate into. This is
usually done by modelling the flux from specific dark matter-rich objects such
as the Milky Way halo, Local Group dwarfs and nearby groups. However, these
objects are expected to have significant emission from baryonic processes as
well, and the analyses discard gamma-ray data over most of the sky. Here we
construct full-sky templates for gamma-ray flux from the large-scale structure
within $\sim$200 Mpc by means of a suite of constrained $N$-body simulations
(CSiBORG) produced using the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies
algorithm. Marginalising over uncertainties in this reconstruction, small-scale
structure and parameters describing astrophysical contributions to the observed
gamma ray sky, we compare to observations from the Fermi Large Area Telescope
to constrain dark matter annihilation cross-sections and decay rates through a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. We rule out the thermal relic cross-section
for $s$-wave annihilation for all $m_\chi \lesssim 7 {\rm \, GeV}/c^2$ at 95%
confidence if the annihilation produces $Z$ bosons, gluons or quarks less
massive than the bottom quark. We infer a contribution to the gamma ray sky
with the same spatial distribution as dark matter decay at $3.3\sigma$.
Although this could be due to dark matter decay via these channels with a decay
rate $\Gamma \approx 3 \times 10^{-28} {\rm \, s^{-1}}$, we find that a
power-law spectrum of index $p=-2.75^{+0.71}_{-0.46}$, likely of baryonic
origin, is preferred by the data.

Title:The POKEMON Speckle Survey of Nearby M dwarfs. I. New Discoveries,"
Abstract:  M dwarfs are favorable targets for exoplanet detection with current
instrumentation, but stellar companions can induce false positives and inhibit
planet characterization. Knowledge of stellar companions is also critical to
our understanding of how binary stars form and evolve. We have therefore
conducted a survey of stellar companions around nearby M dwarfs, and here we
present our new discoveries. Using the DSSI speckle imager at the 4.3-meter
Lowell Discovery Telescope, and the similar NESSI instrument at the 3.5-meter
WIYN telescope, we carried out a volume-limited survey of M-dwarf multiplicity
to 15 parsecs, with a special emphasis on including the later M dwarfs that
were overlooked in previous surveys. Additional brighter targets at larger
distances were included for a total sample size of 1070 M dwarfs. Observations
of these 1070 targets revealed 26 new companions; 22 of these systems were
previously thought to be single. If all new discoveries are confirmed, then the
number of known multiples in the sample will increase by 7.6%. Using our
observed properties, as well as the parallaxes and 2MASS K magnitudes for these
objects, we calculate the projected separation, and estimate the mass ratio and
component spectral types, for these systems. We report the discovery of a new
M-dwarf companion to the white dwarf Wolf 672 A, which hosts a known M-dwarf
companion as well, making the system trinary. We also examine the possibility
that the new companion to 2MASS J13092185-2330350 is a brown dwarf. Finally, we
discuss initial insights from the POKEMON survey.

Title:Jupiter's Temperature Structure: A Reassessment of the Voyager Radio Occultation Measurements,"
Abstract:  The thermal structure of planetary atmospheres is an essential input for
predicting and retrieving the distribution of gases and aerosols, as well as
the bulk chemical abundances. In the case of Jupiter, the temperature at a
reference level - generally taken at 1 bar - serves as the anchor in models
used to derive the planet's interior structure and composition. Most models
assume the temperature measured by the Galileo probe (Seiff et al. 1998).
However, those data correspond to a single location, an unusually clear, dry
region, affected by local atmospheric dynamics. On the other hand, the Voyager
radio occultation observations cover a wider range of latitudes, longitudes,
and times (Lindal et al. 1981). The Voyager retrievals were based on
atmospheric composition and radio refractivity data that require updating and
were never properly tabulated: the few existing tabulations are incomplete and
ambiguous. Here, we present a systematic electronic digitization of all
available temperature profiles from Voyager, followed by their reanalysis,
employing currently accepted values of the abundances and radio refractivities
of atmospheric species. We find the corrected temperature at the 1 bar level to
be up to 4 K greater than previously published values, i.e., 170.3{\pm}3.8 K at
12S (Voyager 1 ingress) and 167.3{\pm}3.8 K at 0N (Voyager 1
egress). This is to be compared with the Galileo probe value of 166.1{\pm}0.8 K
at the edge of an unusual feature at 6.57N. Altogether, this suggests
that Jupiter's tropospheric temperatures may vary spatially by up to 7 K
between 7N and 12S.

Title:The Physical Properties of Low-Redshift FeLoBAL Quasars: II. The Rest-Frame Optical Emission Line Properties,"
Abstract:  We report the results of analysis of the Hbeta emission-line region of a
sample of thirty low-redshift (z<1) iron low-ionization broad absorption line
quasars (FeLoBALQs). Eleven of these objects are newly classified as FeLoBALQs.
A matched sample of 132 unabsorbed quasars was analyzed in parallel. The
emission lines showed the well known anticorrelation between the [OIII] and
FeII emission (Boroson & Green 1992). Using a summary statistic called E1 to
quantify this anticorrelation, we found that while the distribution of E1 for
the unabsorbed quasars has a single peak, the FeLoBALQs have a bimodal shape in
this parameter. Previous studies have shown that the line emission properties
of BAL and non-BAL quasars are consistent, and therefore the difference in the
Hbeta region emission between FeLoBAL quasars and unabsorbed quasars is a new
result. The two populations of FeLoBAL quasars are characterized by low and
high bolometric luminosities and Eddington ratios. Some previous studies have
suggested that BAL quasars are high accretion-rate objects, and therefore the
discovery of the low accretion-rate branch of FeLoBAL quasars was unexpected.
We also found that the Hbeta FWHM is systematically broader among the FeLoBALQs
compared with the non-BAL quasars implying a higher inclination viewing angle
or a dearth of low-velocity line-emitting gas.

Title:High-Precision Redshifts for Type Ia Supernovae with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope P127 Prism,"
Abstract:  We present results from simulating slitless spectroscopic observations with
the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's (Roman) Wide-Field Instrument (WFI)
P127 prism spanning 0.75 $\mu m$ to 1.8 $\mu m$. We quantify the efficiency of
recovered Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) redshifts, as a function of P127 prism
exposure time, to guide planning for future observing programs with the Roman
prism. Generating the two-dimensional dispersed images and extracting
one-dimensional spectra is done with the slitless spectroscopy package pyLINEAR
along with custom-written software. From the analysis of 1698 simulated SN Ia
P127 prism spectra, we show the efficiency of recovering SN redshifts to
$z\lesssim3.0$, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of the Roman P127
prism. Redshift recovery is assessed by setting a requirement of $\sigma_z =
(\left|z - z_\mathrm{true} \right|)/(1+z) \leq 0.01$. We find that 3 hr
exposures are sufficient for meeting this requirement, for $\gtrsim 50\%$ of
the sample of mock SNe Ia at $z\approx2$ and within $\pm5$ days of rest-frame
maximum light in the optical. We also show that a 1 hr integration of Roman can
achieve the same precision in completeness to a depth of $24.4 \pm 0.06$ AB mag
(or $z\lesssim 1$). Implications for cosmological studies with Roman P127 prism
spectra of SNe Ia are also discussed.

Title:The Role of Reconnection in the Onset of Solar Eruptions,"
Abstract:  Solar eruptive events such as coronal mass ejections and eruptive flares are
frequently associated with the emergence of magnetic flux from the convection
zone into the corona. We use three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical
simulations to study the interaction of coronal magnetic fields with emerging
flux and determine the conditions that lead to eruptive activity. A simple
parameter study is performed, varying the relative angle between emerging
magnetic flux and a pre-existing coronal dipole field. We find that in all
cases, the emergence results in a sheared magnetic arcade that transitions to a
twisted coronal flux rope via low-lying magnetic reconnection. This structure,
however, is constrained by its own outer field, and so is non-eruptive in the
absence of reconnection with the overlying coronal field. The amount of this
overlying reconnection is determined by the relative angle between the emerged
and pre-existing fields. The reconnection between emerging and pre-existing
fields is necessary to generate sufficient expansion of the emerging structure
so that flare-like reconnection below the coronal flux rope becomes strong
enough to trigger its release. Our results imply that the relative angle is the
key parameter in determining whether the resultant active regions exhibit
eruptive behavior, and is thus a potentially useful candidate for predicting
eruptions in newly emerging active regions. More generally, our results
demonstrate that the detailed interaction between the convection
zone/photosphere and the corona must be calculated self-consistently in order
to model solar eruptions accurately.

Title:Cosmoglobe: Simulating zodiacal emission with ZodiPy,"
Abstract:  We present ZodiPy, a modern and easy-to-use Python package for modeling the
zodiacal emission seen by an arbitrary Solar System observer, which can be used
for the removal of both thermal emission and scattered sunlight from
interplanetary dust in astrophysical data. The code implements the COBE Diffuse
Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) interplanetary dust model and the Planck
extension, which allows for zodiacal emission predictions at infrared
wavelengths in the 1.25-240 $\mu$m range and at microwave frequencies in the
30-857 GHz range. The predicted zodiacal emission may be extrapolated to
frequencies and wavelengths not covered by the built-in models to produce
forecasts for future experiments. ZodiPy attempts to enable the development of
new interplanetary dust models by providing the community with an easy-to-use
interface for testing both current and future models. We demonstrate how the
software can be used by creating simulated zodiacal emission timestreams for
the DIRBE experiment and show that these agree with corresponding timestreams
produced with the DIRBE Zodiacal Light Prediction Software. We also make binned
maps of the zodiacal emission as predicted to be observed by DIRBE and compare
them with the DIRBE calibrated individual observations (CIO).

Title:Robust Neural Network-Enhanced Estimation of Local Primordial Non-Gaussianity,"
Abstract:  When applied to the non-linear matter distribution of the universe, neural
networks have been shown to be very statistically sensitive probes of
cosmological parameters, such as the linear perturbation amplitude $\sigma_8$.
However, when used as a ""black box"", neural networks are not robust to baryonic
uncertainty. We propose a robust architecture for constraining primordial
non-Gaussianity $f_{NL}$, by training a neural network to locally estimate
$\sigma_8$, and correlating these local estimates with the large-scale density
field. We apply our method to N-body simulations, and show that
$\sigma(f_{NL})$ is 3.5 times better than the constraint obtained from a
standard halo-based approach. We show that our method has the same robustness
property as large-scale halo bias: baryonic physics can change the
normalization of the estimated $f_{NL}$, but cannot change whether $f_{NL}$ is
detected.

Title:RV-detected planets around M dwarfs: Challenges for core accretion models,"
Abstract:  Planet formation is sensitive to the conditions in protoplanetary disks, for
which scaling laws as a function of stellar mass are known. We aim to test
whether the observed population of planets around low-mass stars can be
explained by these trends, or if separate formation channels are needed.
We address this question by confronting a state-of-the-art planet population
synthesis model with a sample of planets around M dwarfs observed by the HARPS
and CARMENES radial velocity (RV) surveys. To account for detection biases, we
performed injection and retrieval experiments on the actual RV data to produce
synthetic observations of planets that we simulated following the core
accretion paradigm.
These simulations robustly yield the previously reported high occurrence of
rocky planets around M dwarfs and generally agree with their planetary mass
function. In contrast, our simulations cannot reproduce a population of giant
planets around stars less massive than 0.5 solar masses. This potentially
indicates an alternative formation channel for giant planets around the least
massive stars that cannot be explained with current core accretion theories. We
further find a stellar mass dependency in the detection rate of short-period
planets. A lack of close-in planets around the earlier-type stars ($M_\star
\gtrsim 0.4\, M_\odot$) in our sample remains unexplained by our model and
indicates dissimilar planet migration barriers in disks of different spectral
subtypes.
Both discrepancies can be attributed to gaps in our understanding of planet
migration in nascent M dwarf systems. They underline the different conditions
around young stars of different spectral subtypes, and the importance of taking
these differences into account when studying planet formation.

Abstract:  The direct characterization of exoplanetary systems with high contrast
imaging is among the highest priorities for the broader exoplanet community. As
large space missions will be necessary for detecting and characterizing
exo-Earth twins, developing the techniques and technology for direct imaging of
exoplanets is a driving focus for the community. For the first time, JWST will
directly observe extrasolar planets at mid-infrared wavelengths beyond 5$\mu$m,
deliver detailed spectroscopy revealing much more precise chemical abundances
and atmospheric conditions, and provide sensitivity to analogs of our solar
system ice-giant planets at wide orbital separations, an entirely new class of
exoplanet. However, in order to maximise the scientific output over the
lifetime of the mission, an exquisite understanding of the instrumental
performance of JWST is needed as early in the mission as possible. In this
paper, we describe our 55-hour Early Release Science Program that will utilize
all four JWST instruments to extend the characterisation of planetary mass
companions to $\sim$15$\mu$m as well as image a circumstellar disk in the
mid-infrared with unprecedented sensitivity. Our program will also assess the
performance of the observatory in the key modes expected to be commonly used
for exoplanet direct imaging and spectroscopy, optimize data calibration and
processing, and generate representative datasets that will enable a broad user
base to effectively plan for general observing programs in future cycles.

Title:Living in a Non-Flat Universe: Theoretical Formalism,"
Abstract:  Recent analysis of the Planck measurements opened a possibility that we live

curvature, here we re-visit the light propagation in a non-flat universe and
provide the gauge-invariant expressions for the cosmological probes: the
luminosity distance, galaxy clustering, weak gravitational lensing, and cosmic
microwave background anisotropies. With the positional dependence of the
spatial metric, the light propagation in a non-flat universe is much more
complicated than in a flat universe. Accounting for all the relativistic
effects and including the vector and tensor contributions, we derive the
expressions for the cosmological probes and explicitly verify their gauge
invariance. We compare our results to previous work in a non-flat universe, if
present, but this work represents the first comprehensive investigation of the
cosmological probes in a non-flat universe. Our theoretical formalism in a
non-flat universe will play a crucial role in constraining the spatial
curvature in the upcoming large-scale surveys.

Abstract:  We present an analysis of deep $Chandra$ Low-Energy and High-Energy
Transmission Grating archival observations of the extraordinarily luminous
radio-quiet quasar H1821+643, hosted by a rich and massive cool-core cluster at
redshift $z=0.3$. These datasets provide high-resolution spectra of the AGN at
two epochs, free from contamination by the intracluster medium and from the
effects of photon pile-up, providing a sensitive probe of the iron-$K$ band. At
both epochs, the spectrum is well described by a power-law continuum plus X-ray
reflection from both the inner accretion disc and cold, slowly-moving distant
matter. Adopting this framework, we proceed to examine the properties of the
inner disc and the black hole spin. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods, we combine constraints from the two epochs assuming that the black
hole spin, inner disc inclination, and inner disc iron abundance are invariant.
The black hole spin is found to be modest, with a 90$\%$ credible range of
${a}^{*}=0.62^{+0.22}_{-0.37}$; and, with a mass $M_\mathrm{BH}$ in the range
$\log (M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\odot)\sim 9.2-10.5$, this is the most massive black
hole candidate for which a well-defined spin constraint has yet been obtained.
The modest spin of this black hole supports previous suggestions that the most
massive black holes may grow via incoherent or chaotic accretion and/or
SMBH-SMBH mergers.

Title:The impact of gas disc flaring on rotation curve decomposition and revisiting baryonic and dark-matter relations for nearby galaxies,"
Abstract:  Gas discs of late-type galaxies are flared, with scale heights increasing
with the distance from the galaxy centres and often reaching kpc scales. We
study the effects of gas disc flaring on the recovered dark matter halo
parameters from rotation curve decomposition. For this, we carefully select a
sample of 32 dwarf and spiral galaxies with high-quality neutral gas, molecular
gas, and stellar mass profiles, robust H\,{\sc i} rotation curves obtained via
3D kinematic modelling, and reliable bulge-disc decomposition. By assuming
vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, we derive the scale heights of the atomic and
molecular gas discs and fit dark matter haloes to the rotation curves
self-consistently. We find that the effect of the gas flaring in the rotation
curve decomposition can play an important role only for the smallest,
gas-dominated dwarfs, while for most of the galaxies the effect is minor and
can be ignored. We revisit the stellar- and baryon-to-halo mass relations
($M_\ast-M_{200}$ and $M_{\rm bar}-M_{200}$). Both relations increase smoothly
up to $M_{200} \approx 10^{12}~\rm{ M_\odot}$, with galaxies at this end having
high $M_\ast/M_{200}$ and $M_{\rm bar}/M_{200}$ ratios approaching the
cosmological baryon fraction. At higher $M_{200}$ the relations show a larger
scatter. Most haloes of our galaxy sample closely follow the concentration-mass
($c_{200}-M_{\rm 200}$) relation resulting from N-body cosmological
simulations. Interestingly, the galaxies deviating above and below the relation
have the highest and lowest stellar and baryon factions, respectively, which
suggests that the departures from the $c_{200}-M_{\rm 200}$ law are regulated
by adiabatic contraction and an increasing importance of feedback.

selected from pure-parallel Hubble Space Telescope imaging programs. We include
132 fields observed as part of the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies survey, the
Hubble Infrared Pure Parallel Imaging Extragalactic Survey, and the WFC3
Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel survey. These observations cover a total of 620
sq. arcmin, about 70% of which is also covered with Spitzer Space Telescope
infrared imaging. We identify thirteen candidate galaxies in the range 8.3<z<11
with 24.5 < m_H < 26.5 (-22.9 < M_UV < -21.2). This sample capitalizes on the
uncorrelated nature of pure parallel observations to overcome cosmic variance
and leverages a full multi-wavelength selection process to minimize
contamination without sacrificing completeness. We perform detailed
completeness and contamination analyses, and present measurements of the bright
end of the UV luminosity function using a pseudo-binning technique. We find a
number density consistent with results from Finkelstein et al. (2022) and other
searches in HST parallel fields. These bright candidates likely reside in
overdensities, potentially representing some of the earliest sites of cosmic

Abstract:  We present the results of bicoherence analysis on observations of GRS

higher order statistic that can be used to probe the relation between the
phases of a triplet of Fourier frequencies. Despite showing very similar power
spectra, the observations exhibit different patterns in their bicoherence,
indicating that the QPOs are phase coupled to the noise in different ways. We
show that the bicoherence pattern exhibited correlates with the frequency of
the QPO, the hardness ratio, as well as the radio properties of the source. In
particular, we find that the nature of phase coupling between the QPO and the
high and low frequency broadband components is different between radio quiet,
radio plateau and radio steep conditions. We also investigate the phase lag
behaviour of observations with QPO frequency above 2Hz that show different
bicoherence patterns, and find statistically significant differences between
them, indicating a change in the underlying physical mechanism. Finally, we
present a scenario whereby the cooling of the jet electrons by soft photons
from the accretion disc could explain the observed correlations between the
bicoherence and radio properties.

Title:Solar CME Plasma Diagnostics Expressed as Potential Stellar CME Signatures,"
Abstract:  Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have a strong association with solar
flares that is not fully understood. This characteristic of our Sun's magnetic
activity may also occur on other stars, but the lack of successfully detected
stellar CMEs makes it difficult to perform statistical studies that might show
a similar association between CMEs and flares. Because of the potentially
strong association, the search for stellar CMEs often starts with a successful
search for superflares on magnetically active stars. Regardless of the flare's
presence, we emphasize the utility of searching for CME-specific spectroscopic
signatures when attempting to find and confirm stellar CME candidates. We use
solar CMEs as examples of why a multitude of ultraviolet emission lines, when
detected simultaneously, can substantially improve the credibility of
spectroscopically discovered stellar CME candidates. We make predictions on how
bright CME-related emission lines can be if they derived from distant stars. We
recommend the use of three emission lines in particular (C IV 1550 Angstroms, O
VI 1032 Angstroms, and C III 977 Angstroms) due to their potentially bright
signal and convenient diagnostic capabilities that can be used to confirm if an

Title:SDSS-IV MaNGA: How the stellar populations of passive central galaxies depend on stellar and halo mass,"
Abstract:  We analyze spatially resolved and co-added SDSS-IV MaNGA spectra with
signal-to-noise ~100 from 2200 passive central galaxies (z~0.05) to understand
how central galaxy assembly depends on stellar mass (M*) and halo mass (Mh). We
control for systematic errors in Mh by employing a new group catalog from
Tinker (2020a,b) and the widely-used Yang et al. (2007) catalog. At fixed M*,
the strength of several stellar absorption features varies systematically with
Mh. Completely model-free, this is one of the first indications that the
stellar populations of centrals with identical M* are affected by the
properties of their host halos. To interpret these variations, we applied full
spectral fitting with the code alf. At fixed M*, centrals in more massive halos
are older, show lower [Fe/H], and have higher [Mg/Fe] with 3.5 sigma
confidence. We conclude that halos not only dictate how much M* galaxies
assemble, but also modulate their chemical enrichment histories. Turning to our
analysis at fixed Mh, high-M* centrals are older, show lower [Fe/H], and have
higher [Mg/Fe] for Mh>10^{12}Msun/h with confidence > 4 sigma. While massive
passive galaxies are thought to form early and rapidly, our results are among
the first to distinguish these trends at fixed Mh. They suggest that high-M*
centrals experienced unique early formation histories, either through enhanced
collapse and gas fueling, or because their halos were early-forming and highly
concentrated, a possible signal of galaxy assembly bias.

Title:Primordial black holes capture by stars and induced collapse to low-mass stellar black holes,"
Abstract:  Primordial black holes in the asteroid-mass window ($\sim 10^{-16}$ to
$10^{-11} \rm M_{\odot}$), which might constitute all the dark matter, can be
captured by stars when they traverse them at low enough velocity. After being
placed on a bound orbit during star formation, they can repeatedly cross the
star if the orbit happens to be highly eccentric, slow down by dynamical
friction and end up in the stellar core. The rate of these captures is highest
in halos of high dark matter density and low velocity dispersion, when the
first stars form at redshift $z \sim 20$. We compute this capture rate for
low-metallicity stars of $0.3$ to $1\rm M_{\odot}$, and find that a high
fraction of these stars formed in the first dwarf galaxies would capture a
primordial black hole, which would then grow by accretion up to a mass that may
be close to the total star mass. We show the capture rate of primordial black
holes does not depend on their mass over this asteroid-mass window, and should
not be much affected by external tidal perturbations. These low-mass stellar
black holes could be discovered today in low-metallicity, old binary systems in
the Milky Way containing a surviving low-mass main-sequence star or a white
dwarf, or via gravitational waves emitted in a merger with another compact
object. No mechanisms in standard stellar evolution theory are known to form
black holes of less than a Chandrasekhar mass, so detecting a low-mass black
hole would fundamentally impact our understanding of stellar evolution, dark
matter and the early Universe.

Title:New insights into the first two PSP solar encounters enabled by modeling analysis with ADAPT-WSA,"
Abstract:  Parker Solar Probes's (PSP)'s unique orbital path allows us to observe the
solar wind closer to the Sun than ever before. Essential to advancing our
knowledge of solar wind and energetic particle formation is identifying the
sources of PSP observations. We report on results for the first two PSP solar
encounters derived using the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model driven by Air Force
Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport (ADAPT) model maps. We derive the
coronal magnetic field and the 1 Rs source regions of the PSP-observed solar
wind. We validate our results with the solar wind speed and magnetic polarity
observed at PSP. When modeling results are very reliable, we derive time series
of model-derived spacecraft separation from the heliospheric current sheet,
magnetic expansion factor, coronal hole boundary distance, and photospheric
field strength along the field lines estimated to be connected to the
spacecraft. We present new results for Encounter 1, which show time evolution
of the far-side mid-latitude coronal hole that PSP co-rotates with. We discuss
how this evolution coincides with solar wind speed, density, and temperature
observed at the spacecraft. During Encounter 2, a new active region emerges on
the far-side, making it difficult to model. We show that ADAPT-WSA output
agrees well with PSP observations once this active region rotates onto the
near-side, allowing us to reliably estimate the solar wind sources
retrospectively for most of the encounter. We close with ways in which coronal
modeling enables scientific interpretation of these encounters that would
otherwise not have been possible.

Title:New Photometric Calibration of the Wide Field Camera 3 Detectors,"
Abstract:  We present a new photometric calibration of the WFC3-UVIS and WFC3-IR
detectors based on observations collected from 2009 to 2020 for four white
dwarfs, namely GRW+70~5824, GD~153, GD~71, G191B2B, and a G-type star, P330E.
These calibrations include recent updates to the Hubble Space Telescope primary
standard white dwarf models and a new reference flux for Vega. Time-dependent
inverse sensitivities for the two WFC3-UVIS chips, UVIS1 and UVIS2, were
calculated for all 42 full-frame filters, after accounting for temporal changes
in the observed count rates with respect to a reference epoch in 2009. We also
derived new encircled energy values for a few filters and improved sensitivity
ratios for the two WFC3-UVIS chips by correcting for sensitivity changes with
time. Updated inverse sensitivity values for the 20 WFC3-UVIS quad filters and
for the 15 WF3-IR filters were derived by using the new models for the primary
standards and the new Vega reference flux and, in the case of the IR detector,
new flat fields. However, these values do not account for any sensitivity
changes with time. The new calibration provides a photometric internal
precision better than 0.5% for the wide-, medium-, and narrow-band WFC3-UVIS
filters, 5% for the quad filters, and 1% for the WFC3-IR filters. As of October
15, 2020, an updated set of photometric keywords are populated in the WFC3
image headers.

Title:Galaxy Cluster Statistics in Modified Gravity Cosmologies,"
Abstract:  If the accelerated expansion of the universe is due to a modification of
general relativity at late times, it is likely that the growth of structure on
large scales would also display deviations from the standard cosmology. We
investigate the statistics of the distribution of galaxy cluster-sized halos as
a probe of gravity. We analyze the output of several matched N-body simulations
with the same initial conditions and expansion histories but using both DGP and
f (R) gravity with various parameters. From each simulation we extract the
cluster mass function, power spectrum, and mean pairwise velocity at redshifts
1, 0.3, and 0. All three statistics display systematic differences between
gravity theories. The mean pairwise velocity provides an important consistency
test for any posited departure from general relativity suggested by
measurements of the power spectrum and cluster mass function. Upcoming
microwave background experiments, including Simons Observatory and CMB- S4,
will detect tens of thousands of galaxy clusters via the thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, probe their masses with lensing of the microwave
background, and potentially measure velocities using the transverse lensing
effect or the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. These cluster measurements
promise to be a substantial probe of modified gravity.

Title:Self-Consistent Grain Depletions and Abundances II: Effects on strong-line diagnostics of extragalactic H II regions,"
Abstract:  The depletion of elements onto dust grains is characterized using a
generalized depletion strength $F_*$ for any sightline, and trend-line
parameters $A_X, B_X$ and $z_X$. The present study uses these parameters to
calculate post-depleted gas-phase abundances of 15 different elements while
varying $F_*$ from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.125. An analysis of emergent
strong spectral line intensities, obtained by inputting the calculated
abundances into a CLOUDY model, shows that the depletion strength has a
non-trivial effect on predicted emission lines and the thermal balance of the
ionized cloud. The depleted elements not only affect the abundance of
corresponding ions but also affects the balance of coolant abundances in the
gas. Furthermore, it was found that each of the parameters - metallicity,
ionization parameter $U$ and depletion strength $F_*$ work in tandem to affect
the emission-line strengths, and thermal balance of the ISM. Finally, comparing
our results to a sample of H II regions using data obtained from the MaNGA
survey revealed that the best-fit $F_*$ was approximately 0.5. This best-fit
value does not work well for all metallicities, and it may be due to Sulfur
depletion.

Title:Plasma Diagnostics in the Era of Integral Field Spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  To understand the physical conditions of various gaseous systems, plasma
diagnostics must be performed properly. To that end, it is equally important to
have extinction correction performed properly. This means that the physical
conditions of the target sources -- the very quantities to be derived via
plasma diagnostics -- must be known even before performing extinction
correction, because the degree of extinction is usually determined by comparing
the observed spectra of the target sources with their theoretically predicted
counterparts. One way to resolve this conundrum is to perform both extinction
correction and plasma diagnostics together by iteratively seeking a converged
solution. In fact, if these analyses are performed self-consistently, a
converged solution can be found based solely on well-calibrated line
intensities, given the adopted extinction law and the R_V value. However, it is
still rare to find these analyses done numerically rigorously from start to
finish. In this contribution for the APN 8e conference, we would like to review
this convoluted problem and sort out critical issues based on the results of
our recent experiments. It appears that the convoluted theoretical and
observational progresses exacerbated by the highly numerical nature of these
analyses necessitated a number of analytical simplifications to make the
problem analytically tractable in the pre-computer era and that such analytical
simplifications still remain rampant in the literature today even after ample
computational resources became readily available. Hence, the community is
encouraged to do away with this old habit of sidestepping numerical
calculations, which may have been a necessary evil in the past. This is
especially true in the context of spatially-resolved 2-D spectroscopy, which
obviously conflicts with the uniformity assumption often blindly inherited from
1-D spectroscopy.

Title:The Fornax3D project: Intrinsic Correlations between Orbital Properties and the Stellar Initial Mass Function,"
Abstract:  [arXiv Abridged] In this work, we explore new spatially-resolved measurements
of the IMF for three edge-on lenticular galaxies in the Fornax cluster.
Specifically, we utilise existing orbit-based dynamical models, which
re-produce the measured stellar kinematics, in order to fit the new IMF maps
within this orbital framework. We then investigate correlations between
intrinsic orbital properties and the local IMF. We find that, within each
galaxy, the high-angular-momentum, disk-like stars exhibit an IMF which is rich
in dwarf stars. The centrally-concentrated pressure-supported orbits have IMF
which are similarly rich in dwarf stars. Conversely, orbits at large radius
which have intermediate angular momentum exhibit IMF which are markedly less
dwarf-rich relative to the other regions of the same galaxy. Assuming that the
stars which, in the present-day, reside on dynamically-hot orbits at large
radii are dominated by accreted populations, we can interpret these findings as
a correlation between the dwarf-richness of a population of stars, and the mass
of the host in which it formed. Specifically, deeper gravitational potentials
would produce more dwarf-rich populations, resulting in the relative deficiency
of dwarf stars which originated in the lower-mass accreted satellites.
Conversely, the central and high angular-momentum populations are likely
dominated by in-situ stars, which were formed in the more massive host itself.
There are also global differences between the three galaxies studied here, of
up to $\sim 0.3\ \mathrm{dex}$ in the IMF parameter $\xi$. We find no local
dynamical or chemical property which alone can fully account for the IMF
variations.

Title:Rotation of Low-Mass Stars in Upper Centaurus Lupus and Lower Centaurus Crux with TESS,"
Abstract:  We present stellar rotation rates derived from Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS) light curves for stars in Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL; ~136 pc,
~16 Myr) and Lower Centaurus-Crux (LCC; ~115 pc, ~17 Myr). We find
spot-modulated periods (P) for ~90% of members. The range of light curve and
periodogram shapes echoes that found for other clusters with K2, but fewer
multi-period stars may be an indication of different noise characteristics of
TESS, or a result of the source selection methods here. The distribution of P
as a function of color as a proxy for mass fits nicely in between that for both
older and younger clusters observed by K2, with fast rotators found among both
the highest and lowest masses probed here, and a well-organized distribution of
M star rotation rates. About 13% of the stars have an infrared (IR) excess,
suggesting a circumstellar disk; this is well-matched to expectations, given
the age of the stars. There is an obvious pile-up of disked M stars at P~2
days, and the pile-up may move to shorter P as the mass decreases. There is
also a strong concentration of disk-free M stars at P~2 days, hinting that
perhaps these stars have recently freed themselves from their disks. Exploring
the rotation rates of stars in UCL/LCC has the potential to help us understand
the beginning of the end of the influence of disks on rotation, and the
timescale on which the star responds to unlocking.

annihilating dark matter. In this article, we use the radio continuum spectral
data of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to analyze the dark matter

matter annihilation with a $1.5\sigma$ statistical significance. The overall
best-fit dark matter mass is $m_{\rm DM} \approx 90$ GeV, annihilating via
$b\bar{b}$ channel. We have also constrained the $3\sigma$ lower limits of dark
matter mass with the standard thermal dark matter annihilation cross section
for the $e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$ and $b\bar{b}$ channels.

Title:Cost-Optimal System Performance Maps for Laser-Accelerated Sailcraft,"
Abstract:  Breakthrough Starshot is an initiative to explore the Centauri system using
laser-accelerated sailcraft. Earlier work produced a point design for a 0.2 c
mission carrying 1 g of payload. The present work widens the design space to
missions having 0.1 mg to 100 kt payload and 0.0001-0.99 c cruise velocity.
Also, the beam director may now draw up to 5 GW of power directly from the grid
to augment the power drawn from its energy storage system.
Augmenting stored energy with grid power shrinks beam director capital cost
by up to 5 orders of magnitude for smaller missions, enabling new
possibilities: A 0.1 mg microbiome accelerated to 0.01 c in only 4 min by a
\$21M beam director, expending only \$6k worth of energy to do so. A 10 kg
Solar system cubesat accelerated to 0.001 c (63 au/yr) by a \$610M beam
director that expends \$58M worth of energy per mission.
A progression from cost-optimized point designs to whole performance maps has
been made possible by replacing numerical trajectory integration with
closed-form equations. Consequently, the system model computes point designs
1-2 orders of magnitude faster than before. Resulting maps reveal different
solution regimes characterized by their performance-limiting constraints.
The performance maps also reveal a family of missions that accelerate at
Earth gravity. The heaviest such mission is a 7.4 km diameter 100 kt vessel
(equivalent to 225 International Space Stations) that is accelerated for 21
days to achieve 0.07 c, reaching the Centauri system within a human lifetime.
While unthinkable at this time, the required 380 PW peak radiated power (twice
terrestrial insolation) might be generated by space solar power or fusion
within a few centuries. Regardless, it is now possible to contemplate such a
mission as a laser-accelerated sailcraft.

Title:Dark dots on the photosphere and counting of the sunspots index,"
Abstract:  On modern satellite observations of the Sun in the continuum with high
spatial resolution, as well as on high-quality ground observations, a large
number of small dark areas can be observed. These regions have no penumbra,
have a contrast of up to 20% and are similar to solar pores. The characteristic
area of such structures is $0.3\div5\ \mu$hm or $0.5\div5$ Mm. The number of
such points in one image can be several hundred. The nature of such formations
remains unclear.
We have performed the selection of dark regions with a contrast of at least
3% of the level of the quiet Sun on the SDO/HMI observational data in the
continuum for 2010-2020. We have studied the properties of ""dark points,
including the change with the cycle of activity, area distribution and
contrast. We also compared such structures with the intensity of the magnetic
field. We found that the number of dark dots with an area of less than 5 mhm,
in which the magnetic field is not significant and is less than |B|<30 G, is
from 60 to 80% of the total number of structures of this size. This means that
these objects are not associated with magnetic activity. The existence of such
structures can significantly affect the calculations of the sunspot index,
since they can be mistaken as pores.

Title:Optical linear polarization study towards Czernik 3 open cluster at different spatial scales,"
Abstract:  We present the optical linear polarization observation of stars towards the
core of the Czernik 3 cluster in the Sloan i-band. The data were obtained using
the EMPOL instrument on the 1.2 m telescope at Mount Abu Observatory. We study
the dust distribution towards this cluster by combining the results from our
polarization observations with the data from Gaia EDR3, WISE, and the HI,
$^{12}$CO surveys. In addition, we use the polarimetric data of previously
studied clusters within 15$^\circ$ of Czernik 3 to understand the large scale
dust distribution. The observational results of Czernik 3 show a large range in
the degree of polarization, indicating that the dust is not uniformly
distributed over the plane of the sky, even on a small scale. The distance to
the Czernik 3 is constrained to $3.6\pm0.8$ kpc using the member stars in the
core region identified from Gaia EDR3 astrometry. This makes it one of the most
distant clusters observed for optical polarization so far. The variation of
observed degree of polarization and extinction towards this cluster direction
suggests the presence of at least two dust layers along this line of sight at
distances of $\sim 1$ kpc and $\sim 3.4$ kpc. There is an indication of the
presence of dust in the centre of the cluster, as seen from an increase in the
degree of polarization and WISE W4 flux. The large scale distribution of dust
reveals the presence of a region of low dust content between the local arm and
the Perseus arm.

Title:X-ray emission of contact binary variables within 1 kpc,"
Abstract:  By assembling the largest sample to date of X-ray emitting EW-type binaries
(EWXs), we carried out correlation analyses for the X-ray luminosity
log$L_{\textrm{X}}$, and X-ray activity level
log($L_{\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\textrm{bol}}$) versus the orbital period $P$ and
effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$. We find strong $P$-log$L_{\textrm{X}}$ and
$P$-log($L_{\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\textrm{bol}}$) correlations for EWXs with $P$ <
0.44 days and we provide the linear parametrizations for these relations, on
the basis of which the orbital period can be treated as a good predictor for
log$L_{\textrm{X}}$ and log($L_{\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\textrm{bol}}$). The
aforementioned binary stellar parameters are all correlated with
log$L_{\textrm{X}}$, while only $T_{\rm eff}$ exhibits a strong correlation
with log($L_{\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\textrm{bol}}$). Then, EWXs with higher
temperature show lower X-ray activity level, which could indicate the thinning
of the convective area related to the magnetic dynamo mechanism. The total
X-ray luminosity of an EWX is essentially consistent with that of an X-ray
saturated main sequence star with the same mass as its primary, which may imply
that the primary star dominates the X-ray emission. The monotonically
decreasing $P$-log($L_{\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\textrm{bol}}$) relation and the short
orbital periods indicate that EWXs could all be in the X-ray saturated state,
and they may inherit the changing trend of the saturated X-ray luminosities
along with the mass shown by single stars. For EWXs, the orbital period, mass,
and effective temperature increase in concordance. We demonstrate that the
period $P=0.44$ days corresponds to the primary mass of $\sim1.1 \rm M_\odot$,
beyond which the saturated X-ray luminosity of single stars will not continue
to increase with mass. This explains the break in the positive
$P$-log$L_{\textrm{X}}$ relation for EWXs with $P>0.44$ days.

Title:Shapes of non-Gaussianity in warm inflation,"
Abstract:  Sphaleron heating has been recently proposed as a mechanism to realize warm
inflation when inflaton is an axion coupled to pure Yang-Mills. As a result of
heating, there is a friction coefficient $\gamma \propto T^3$ in the equation
of motion for the inflaton, and a thermal contribution to cosmological
fluctuations. Without the knowledge of the inflaton potential, non-Gaussianity
is the most promising way of searching for the signatures of this model.
Building on an earlier work by Bastero-Gil, Berera, Moss and Ramos, we compute
the scalar three-point correlation function and point out some distinct
features in the squeezed and folded limits. As a detection strategy, we show
that the combination of the equilateral template and one new template has a
large overlap with the shape of non-Gaussianity over the range $0.01
\leq\gamma/H\leq 1000$, and in this range $0.7 <|f_{\rm NL}| < 50$.

Title:The competition between the hydrodynamic instability from noise and magnetorotational instability in the Keplerian disks,"
Abstract:  We venture for the comparison between growth rates for magnetorotational
instability (MRI) and hydrodynamics instability in the presence of an extra
force in the local Keplerian accretion flow. The underlying model is described
by the Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire equations in the presence of rotation,
magnetic field and an extra force, plausibly noise with a nonzero mean. We
obtain MRI using Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation without extra
force for purely vertical magnetic field and vertical wavevector of the
perturbations. Expectedly, MRI is active within a range of magnetic field,
which changes depending on the perturbation wavevector magnitude. Next, to
check the effect of noise on the growth rates, a quartic dispersion relation
has been obtained. Among those four solutions for growth rate, the one that
reduces to MRI growth rate at the limit of vanishing mean of noise in the MRI
active region of the magnetic field, is mostly dominated by MRI. However, in
MRI inactive region, in the presence of noise the solution turns out to be
unstable, which are almost independent of the magnetic field. Another growth
rate, which is almost complementary to the previous one, leads to stability at
the limit of vanishing noise. The remaining two growth rates, which correspond
to the hydrodynamical growth rates at the limit of the vanishing magnetic
field, are completely different from the MRI growth rate. More interestingly,
the latter growth rates are larger than that of the MRI. If we consider
viscosity, the growth rates decrease depending on the Reynolds number.

Abstract:  We have been developing the monolithic active pixel detector ""XRPIX"" onboard

pixel circuits, SiO2 insulator, and Si sensor by utilizing the
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology. When the semiconductor detector is
operated in orbit, it suffers from radiation damage due to X-rays emitted from
the celestial objects as well as cosmic rays. From previous studies, positive
charges trapped in the SiO2 insulator are known to cause the degradation of the
detector performance. To improve the radiation hardness, we developed XRPIX
equipped with Double-SOI (D-SOI) structure, introducing an additional silicon
layer in the SiO2 insulator. This structure is aimed at compensating for the
effect of the trapped positive charges. Although the radiation hardness to
cosmic rays of the D-SOI detectors has been evaluated, the radiation effect due
to the X-ray irradiation has not been evaluated. Then, we conduct an X-ray
irradiation experiment using an X-ray generator with a total dose of 10 krad at
the SiO2 insulator, equivalent to 7 years in orbit. As a result of this
experiment, the energy resolution in full-width half maximum for the 5.9 keV
X-ray degrades by 17.8 $\pm$ 2.8% and the dark current increases by 89 $\pm$
13%. We also investigate the physical mechanism of the increase in the dark
current due to X-ray irradiation using TCAD simulation. It is found that the
increase in the dark current can be explained by the increase in the interface
state density at the Si/SiO2 interface.

Title:Constraints on the Transition Redshift using the Cosmic Triangle and Hubble Phase Space Portrait,"
Abstract:  One of the most significant discoveries in modern cosmology is that the
universe is currently in a phase of accelerated expansion after a switch from a
decelerated expansion. The redshift corresponding to this time is commonly
referred as the transition redshift $z_t$. In this work we put constraints on
the transition redshift with both model-dependent and model-independent
approaches. We consider the recently compiled database of 32 Hubble parameter
measurements. In order to include the possible systematic effects in this
analysis, we use full covariance matrix of systematic uncertainties. In the
first part we follow a model dependent approach. Here, we consider a non-flat
$\Lambda$CDM model as a background cosmological model. Further we reconstruct
cosmic triangle plot among $\log(\Omega_{m0})$, $-\log(2\Omega_{\Lambda0})$ and
$3\log(1+z_t)$ where the constraints of each parameter are determined by the
location in this triangle plot. Using $\Omega_{m0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda0}$
values, we find the best value of the transition redshift
$z_t=0.619^{+0.580}_{-0.758}$, which is in good agreement with the Planck 2018
results at $1\sigma$ confidence level. The second part is based on a
non-parametric method. We plot a Hubble Phase Space Portrait (HPSP) between
$\dot{H}(z)$ and $H(z)$. From this HPSP diagram, we estimate the transition
redshift as well as the current value of the equation of state parameter
$\omega_0$ in a model-independent way. We find the best fit value of
$z_t=0.591^{+0.365}_{-0.365}$ and $\omega_0=-0.677^{+0.284}_{-0.284}$. We also
simulate the observed Hubble parameter measurements in the redshift range
$0<z<2$ and perform the same analysis to estimate the transition redshift.

We conducted a standard single pulse search with a temporal and spectral
resolution of $100\,\upmu$s and 10\,kHz over a broad range of dispersion
measures from 1 to $5000\,\text{pc}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, but none were detected.
However, fluence upper limits of $77\text{--}224$\,Jy\,ms derived over a pulse
width of $0.5\text{--}10$\,ms and a redshift of $0.6<z<4$ are some of the most
stringent at low radio frequencies. We compared these fluence limits to the GRB
jet-interstellar medium (ISM) interaction model, placing constraints on the
fraction of magnetic energy ($\epsilon_{\text{B}}\lesssim[0.05 \text{--}
0.1]$). We also searched for signals during the X-ray flaring activity of GRB
210419A on minute timescales in the image domain and found no emission,
resulting in an intensity upper limit of $0.57\,\text{Jy}\,\text{beam}^{-1}$,
corresponding to a constraint of $\epsilon_{\text{B}}\lesssim10^{-3}$. Our
non-detection could imply that GRB 210419A was at a high redshift, there was
not enough magnetic energy for low-frequency emission, or that the radio waves
did not escape from the GRB environment.

Title:A geostatistical analysis of multiscale metallicity variations in galaxies [II]: Predicting the metallicities of Hii and diffuse ionised gas regions via universal kriging,"
Abstract:  The metallicity of diffuse ionised gas (DIG) cannot be determined using
strong emission line diagnostics, which are calibrated to calculate the
metallicity of Hii regions. Because of this, resolved metallicity maps from
integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data remain largely incomplete. In this paper
(the second of a series), we introduce the geostatistical technique of
universal kriging, which allows the complete 2D metallicity distribution of a
galaxy to be reconstructed from metallicities measured at Hii regions,
accounting for spatial correlations between nearby data points. We apply this
method to construct high-fidelity metallicity maps of the local spiral galaxy
NGC 5236 using data from the TYPHOON/PrISM survey. We find significant
correlation in the metallicity of Hii regions separated by up to 0.4-1.2 kpc.
Predictions constructed using this method were tested using cross-validation in
Hii regions, and we show that they outperform significantly interpolation based
on metallicity gradients. Furthermore, we apply kriging to predict the
metallicities in regions dominated by DIG emission, considering seven
additional spiral galaxies with high resolution (<100pc) metallicity maps. We
compare kriging maps to DIG metallicities computed with novel ionisation
corrections, and find that such corrections introduce a systematic offset of up
to $\pm0.1$ dex for any individual galaxy, with a scatter of 0.02-0.07 dex for
the sample. Overall we recommend universal kriging, together with a calibrated
geostatistical model, as the superior method for inferring the metallicities of
DIG-dominated regions in local spiral galaxies, demonstrating further the
potential of applying geostatistical methods to spatially resolved galaxy
observations.

"Title:Towards an understanding of YSO variability: A multi-wavelength analysis of bursting, dipping, and symmetrically varying light curves of disc-bearing YSOs","
Abstract:  Using simultaneous optical and infrared light curves of disc-bearing young
stars in NGC 2264, we perform the first multi-wavelength structure function
study of YSOs. We find that dippers have larger variability amplitudes than
bursters and symmetric variables at all timescales longer than a few hours. By
analysing optical-infrared colour time-series, we also find that the
variability in the bursters is systematically less chromatic at all timescales
than the other variability types. We propose a model of YSO variability in
which symmetric, bursting, and dipping behaviour is observed in systems viewed
at low, intermediate, and high inclinations, respectively. We argue that the
relatively short thermal timescale for the disc can explain the fact that the
infrared light curves for bursters are more symmetric than their optical
counterparts.

Title:On the Dayside Atmosphere of WASP-12b,"
Abstract:  The atmospheric structure of WASP-12b has been hotly contested for years,
with disagreements on the presence of a thermal inversion as well as the
carbon-to-oxygen ratio, C/O, due to retrieved abundances of H2O, CO2, and other
included species such as HCN and C2H2. Previously, these difficult-to-diagnose
discrepancies have been attributed to model differences; assumptions in these
models were thought to drive retrievals toward different answers. Here, we show
that some of these differences are independent of model assumptions and are
instead due to subtle differences in the inputs, such as the eclipse depths and
line-list databases. We replicate previously published retrievals and find that
the retrieved results are data driven and are mostly unaffected by the addition
of species such as HCN and C2H2. We also propose a new physically motivated
model that takes into consideration the formation of H- via the thermal
dissociation of H2O and H2 at the temperatures reached in the dayside
atmosphere of WASP-12b, but the data's current resolution does not support its
inclusion in the atmospheric model. This study raises the concern that other
exoplanet retrievals may be similarly sensitive to slight changes in the input
data.

Title:Faraday conversion in pair-symmetric winds of magnetars and Fast Radio Bursts,"
Abstract:  We consider propagation of polarization in the inner parts of pair-symmetric
magnetar winds, close to the light cylinder. Pair plasmas in magnetic field is
birefringent, a $\propto B^2$ effect. As a result, such plasmas work as phase
retarders: Stokes parameters follow a circular trajectory on the Poincare
sphere. In the highly magnetized regime, $\omega, \, \omega_p \ll \omega_B$,
the corresponding rotation rates are independent of the magnetic field. A
plasma screen with dispersion measure DM $\sim 10^{-6}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ can induce
large polarization changes, including large effective Rotation Measure (RM).
The frequency scaling of the (generalized) RM, $ \propto \lambda ^\alpha $,
mimics the conventional RM with $\alpha =2$ for small phase shifts, but can be
as small as $\alpha =1$. In interpreting observations the frequency scaling of
polarization parameters should be fitted independently. The model offers
explanations for (i) large circular polarization component observed in FRBs,
with right-left switching; (ii) large RM, with possible sign changes; (iii)
time-depend variable polarization. Relatively dense and slow wind is needed -
the corresponding effect in regular pulsars is small.

Title:Toward Realistic Models of Core Collapse Supernovae: A Brief Review,"
Abstract:  Motivated by their role as the direct or indirect source of many of the
elements in the Universe, numerical modeling of core collapse supernovae began
more than five decades ago. Progress toward ascertaining the explosion
mechanism(s) has been realized through increasingly sophisticated models, as
physics and dimensionality have been added, as physics and numerical modeling
have improved, and as the leading computational resources available to modelers
have become far more capable. The past five to ten years have witnessed the
emergence of a consensus across the core collapse supernova modeling community
that had not existed in the four decades prior. For the majority of progenitors
- i.e., slowly rotating progenitors - the efficacy of the delayed shock
mechanism, where the stalled supernova shock wave is revived by neutrino
heating by neutrinos emanating from the proto-neutron star, has been
demonstrated by all core collapse supernova modeling groups, across progenitor
mass and metallicity. With this momentum, and now with a far deeper
understanding of the dynamics of these events, the path forward is clear. While
much progress has been made, much work remains to be done, but at this time we
have every reason to be optimistic we are on track to answer one of the most
important outstanding questions in astrophysics: How do massive stars end their
lives?

Title:Evolution of thermal and nonthermal radio continuum emission on kpc scales--Predictions for SKA,"
Abstract:  Resolved maps of the thermal and nonthermal radio continuum (RC) emission of
distant galaxies are a powerful tool for understanding the role of the
interstellar medium (ISM) in the evolution of galaxies. We simulate the RC
surface brightness of present-day star forming galaxies in the past at
$0.15<z<3$ considering two cases of radio size evolution: (1)~no evolution, and
(2)~same evolution as in the optical. We aim to investigate the a)~structure of
the thermal and nonthermal emission on kpc scales, b)~evolution of the thermal
fraction and synchrotron spectrum at mid-radio frequencies ($\simeq$1-10\,GHz),
and c)~capability of the proposed SKA1-MID reference surveys in detecting the
RC emitting structures. The synchrotron spectrum flattens with $z$ causing
curvature in the observed mid-radio SEDs of galaxies at higher $z$. The
spectral index reported in recent observational studies agrees better with the
no size evolution scenario. In this case, the mean thermal fraction observed at
1.4\,GHz increases with redshift by more than 30\% from $z=0.15$ to $z=2$
because of the drop of the synchrotron emission at higher
rest-frame~frequencies. More massive galaxies have lower thermal fractions and
experience a faster flattening of the nonthermal spectrum. The proposed
SKA1-MID band~2 reference survey, unveils the ISM in M51- and NGC6946-like
galaxies (with ${\rm M_{\star}}\simeq10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) up to $z=3$.
This survey detects lower-mass galaxies like M33 (${\rm
M_{\star}}\simeq10^{9}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) only at low redshifts $z\lesssim
0.5$. For a proper separation of the RC emitting processes at the peak of star
formation, it is vital to include band~1 into the SKA1-MID reference surveys.

Title:Galactic winds and bubbles from nuclear starburst rings,"
Abstract:  Galactic outflows from local starburst galaxies typically exhibit a layered
geometry, with cool $10^4\,$K flow sheathing a hotter $10^7\,$K,
cylindrically-collimated, X-ray emitting plasma. Here, we argue that winds
driven by energy-injection in a ring-like geometry can produce this distinctive
large-scale multi-phase morphology. The ring configuration is motivated by the
observation that massive young star clusters are often distributed in a ring at
the host galaxy's inner Lindblad resonance, where larger-scale spiral arm
structure terminates. We present parameterized three-dimensional radiative
hydrodynamical simulations that follow the emergence and dynamics of
energy-driven hot winds from starburst rings. In this Letter, we show that the
flow shocks on itself within the inner ring hole, maintaining high $10^7$\,K
temperatures, whilst flows that emerge from the wind-driving ring unobstructed
can undergo rapid bulk cooling down to $10^4\,$K, producing a fast hot
bi-conical outflow enclosed by a sheath of cooler nearly co-moving material
without ram-pressure acceleration. The hot flow is collimated along the ring
axis, even in the absence of pressure confinement from a galactic disk or
magnetic fields. In the early stages of expansion, the emerging wind forms a
bubble-like shape reminiscent of the Milky Way's eROSITA and Fermi bubbles and
can reach velocities usually associated with AGN-driven winds. We discuss the
physics of the ring configuration, the conditions for radiative bulk cooling,
and the implications for future X-ray observations.

Title:Nova Sagittarii 1943 (V1148 Sgr): A Luminous Red Nova?,"
Abstract:  Nova Sagittarii 1943 (V1148 Sgr) was an 8th-mag optical transient that was
unusual in having a late-type spectrum during its outburst, in striking
contrast to the normal high-excitation spectra seen in classical novae.
Unfortunately, only an approximate position was given in the discovery
announcement, hampering follow-up attempts to observe its remnant. We have
identified the nova on two photographic plates in the Harvard archive, allowing
us to determine a precise astrometric position. Apart from these two plates,
obtained in 1943 and 1944, none of the photographs in the Harvard collection,
from 1897 to 1950, show V1148 Sgr to limits as faint as g ~ 18.3. Modern deep
images show a candidate remnant at i ~ 19.2, lying only 0"".26 from the site of
the nova. V1148 Sgr may have been a luminous red nova (LRN), only the sixth one
known in the Milky Way. However, it lacks the near- and mid-infrared excesses,
and millimeter-wave emission, seen in other LRNe, leaving its nature uncertain.
We urge spectroscopy of the candidate remnant.

Abstract:  We study geometrical destabilization of inflation with the aim of determining
the fate of excited unstable modes. We use numerical lattice simulations to
track the dynamics of both the inflaton and the spectator field. We find that
geometrical destabilization is a short-lived phenomenon and that a negative
feedback loop prevents field fluctuations from growing indefinitely. As a
result, fields undergoing geometrical destabilization are merely shifted to a
new classical configuration corresponding to a uniform value of the spectator
field within a Hubble patch.

Title:The Roles of Dust Growth in the Temperature Evolution and Snow Line Migration in Magnetically Accreting Protoplanetary Disks,"
Abstract:  The temperature structure of protoplanetary disks provides an important
constraint on where in the disks rocky planets like our own form. Recent
nonideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations have shown that the internal
Joule heating associated with magnetically driven disk accretion is inefficient
at heating the disk midplane. A disk temperature model based on the MHD
simulations predicts that in a disk around a solar-mass young star, the water
snow line can move inside the current Earth's orbit within 1 Myr after disk
formation. However, the efficiency of the internal Joule heating depends on the
disk's ionization and opacity structures, both of which are governed by dust
grains. In this study, we investigate these effects by combing the previous
temperature model for magnetically accreting disks with a parameterized model
for the grain size and vertical distribution. Grain growth enhances the gas
ionization fraction and thereby allows Joule heating to occur closer to the
midplane. However, growth beyond 10 ${\rm \mu m}$ causes a decrease in the disk
opacity, leading to a lower midplane temperature. The combination of these two
effects results in the midplane temperature being maximized when the grain size
is in the range 10-100 ${\rm \mu m}$. Under favorable conditions, grain growth
to 10-100 ${\rm \mu m}$ sizes can delay the snow line's migration to the 1 au
orbit by up to a few Myr. We conclude that accounting for dust growth is
essential for accurately modeling the snow line evolution and terrestrial
planet formation in magnetically accreting protoplanetary disks.

Title:Effects of CO-dark Gas on Measurements of Molecular Cloud Stability and the Size-Linewidth Relationship,"
Abstract:  Stars form within molecular clouds, so characterizing the physical states of
molecular clouds is key in understanding the process of star formation. Cloud
structure and stability is frequently assessed using metrics including the
virial parameter and Larson (1981) scaling relationships between cloud radius,
velocity dispersion, and surface density. Departures from the typical Galactic
relationships between these quantities have been observed in low-metallicity
environments. The amount of H$_2$ gas in cloud envelopes without corresponding
CO emission is expected to be high under these conditions; therefore, this
""CO-dark"" gas could plausibly be responsible for the observed variations in
cloud properties. We derive simple corrections that can be applied to empirical
clump properties (mass, radius, velocity dispersion, surface density, and
virial parameter) to account for CO-dark gas in clumps following power-law and
Plummer mass density profiles. We find that CO-dark gas is not likely to be the
cause of departures from Larson's relationships in low-metallicity regions, but
that virial parameters may be systematically overestimated. We demonstrate that
correcting for CO-dark gas is critical for accurately comparing the dynamical
state and evolution of molecular clouds across diverse environments.

Title:Revisiting Common Envelope Evolution -- A New Semi-Analytic Model for N-body and Population Synthesis Codes,"
Abstract:  We present a novel way of modeling common envelope evolution in binary and
few-body systems. We consider the common envelope inspiral as driven by a drag
force with a power-law dependence in relative distance and velocity. The
orbital motion is resolved either by direct N-body integration or by solving
the set of differential equations for the orbital elements as derived using
perturbation theory. Our formalism can model the eccentricity during the common
envelope inspiral, and it gives results consistent with smoothed particles
hydrodynamical simulations. We apply our formalism to common envelope events
from binary population synthesis models and find that the final eccentricity
distribution resembles the observed distribution of post-common-envelope
binaries. Our model can be used for time-resolved common-envelope evolution in
population synthesis calculations or as part of binary interactions in direct
N-body simulations of star clusters.

Title:Anatomy of single-field inflationary models for primordial black holes,"
Abstract:  We construct an analytically solvable simplified model that captures the
essential features for primordial black hole (PBH) production in most models of
single-field inflation. The construction makes use of the Wands duality between
the constant-roll (or slow-roll) and the preceding ultra-slow-roll phases and
can be realized by a simple inflaton potential of two joined parabolas. Within
this framework, it is possible to formulate explicit inflationary scenarios
consistent with the CMB observations and copious production of PBHs of
arbitrary mass. We quantify the variability of the shape of the peak in the
curvature power spectrum in different inflationary scenarios and discuss its
implications for probing PBHs with scalar-induced gravitational wave
backgrounds. We find that the COBE/Firas $\mu$-distortion constraints exclude
the production of PBHs heavier than $10^4 M_\odot$ in single-field inflation.

Title:Multi-messenger Emission from Tidal Waves in Neutron Star Oceans,"
Abstract:  Astrophysical binary systems including neutron stars represent exciting
sources for multi-messenger astrophysics. A little considered source of
electromagnetic transients accompanying compact binary systems is a neutron
star ocean, the external fluid layer encasing a neutron star. We present a
groundwork study into tidal waves in neutron star oceans and their
consequences. Specifically, we investigate how oscillation modes in neutron
star oceans can be tidally excited during compact binary inspirals and
parabolic encounters to produce tidal waves. We find that neutron star oceans
can sustain tidal waves with frequencies under 100 mHz. Our results suggest
that resonant neutron star ocean tidal waves may serve as a never-before
studied source for precursor electromagnetic emission prior to neutron
star-black hole and binary neutron star mergers. Resonant neutron star ocean
tidal waves, whose energy budget can reach $10^{45}$ erg, may serve as very
early warning signs ($\sim1-10$ yr before merger) for compact binary mergers if
accompanied by electromagnetic flares. Similarly, excited ocean tidal waves
will coincide with neutron star parabolic encounters. Depending on the neutron
star ocean model and a flare emission scenario, flares may be detectable by
Fermi and NuSTAR out to $\sim100$ Mpc with detection rates as high as $\sim 7$
yr$^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars and $\sim0.6$ yr$^{-1}$ for neutron
star-black hole binaries. Observations of emission from neutron star ocean
tidal waves along with gravitational waves will provide insight into the
equation of state at the neutron star surface, the composition of neutron star
oceans and crusts, and neutron star geophysics.

Title:The impact of a massive Sagittarius dSph on GD-1-like streams,"
Abstract:  We investigate the effects of a massive ($\gtrsim4\times10^{10}M_\odot$)
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) on stellar streams using test
particle simulations in a realistic Milky Way potential. We find that Sgr can
easily disrupt streams formed more than $\sim3$ Gyr ago, while stars stripped
more recently are generally unaffected. In certain realizations, Sgr is able to
produce asymmetry between the leading and trailing tails of Pal 5,
qualitatively similar to observations. Using data from the Gaia space telescope
and elsewhere, we fit models to the GD-1 stream in the presence of a Sgr with
various initial masses. While the best-fitting models do show perturbations
resulting from interactions with Sgr, we find that the level of disruption is
not significantly greater than in the observed stream. To investigate the
general effects of Sgr on a population of streams, we generate 1000 mock
streams on GD-1-like orbits with randomized orientations. Some streams show
clear evidence of disruption, becoming folded on the sky or developing
asymmetry betweeen their two tails. However, many survive unaffected and the
peak surface brightness of stars is decreased by no more than $\sim0.3$
mag/arcsec$^2$ on average. We conclude that Sgr having an initial mass of
$\gtrsim4\times10^{10}M_\odot$ is compatible with the survival and detection of
streams formed more than 3 Gyr ago.

Abstract:  Axion-like particles (ALPs) decaying into photons are known to affect a wide

ALPs with masses in the keV-MeV range and lifetimes between $10^4$ and
$10^{13}$ seconds, corresponding to decays between the end of Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis and the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).
Using the CosmoBit module of the global fitting framework GAMBIT, we combine
state-of-the-art calculations of the irreducible ALP freeze-in abundance,
primordial element abundances (including photodisintegration through ALP
decays), CMB spectral distortions and anisotropies, and constraints from
supernovae and stellar cooling. This approach makes it possible for the first
time to perform a global analysis of the ALP parameter space while varying the
parameters of $\Lambda$CDM as well as several nuisance parameters. We find a
lower bound on the ALP mass of around $m_a > 300\,\text{keV}$, which can only
be evaded if ALPs are stable on cosmological timescales. Future observations of
CMB spectral distortions with a PIXIE-like mission are expected to improve this
bound by two orders of magnitude.

due to dust in star forming regions and diffuse interstellar medium. The $g-r$
colour-stellar mass diagram, at z=0.1, presents a defined red sequence,
reaching $g-r \simeq 0.8$, 0.05 dex redder than EAGLE at high masses, and a
well populated blue cloud, when field galaxies are included. The clusters'
inner regions are dominated by red-sequence galaxies at all masses, although a
non-negligible amount of blue galaxies are still present. We adopt Bayesian
inference to compute the clusters LFs, testing for statistical significance of
both single and double Schechter functions. The multicolour LFs at z=0 show a
knee luminosity that peaks in the infrared and increases with the cluster's
mass. The faint-end is weakly dependent on colour and mass and shows an upturn
in the optical, bounded between -1.25 and -1.39, just moderately steeper than
the field. The simulations reproduce, within the observational errors, the

Abstract:  The images of Sagittarius A$^*$ recently released by the Event Horizon
Telescope collaboration have been accompanied [Ap.J.Lett.\,{\bf

absence of a trapping horizon, i.e.~on the possibility that the object at the
center of our galaxy is an ultra-compact object with a surface re-emitting
incident radiation. Indeed, using the observed image size and the broadband
spectrum of Sgr A$^*$, it is claimed that the radius of any such thermal
surface is strongly bounded from above by these latest observations. Herein, we
discuss how the reported constraint relies on the extremely strong assumption
of perfect balance in the energy exchange between the accretion disk and the
central object, and show that this is violated whenever the surface is endowed
with any non-zero absorption coefficient. We discuss in detail the upper-bound
constraints that can be cast on the radius and dimensionless absorption
coefficient of the surface. We show that the conclusions of the analysis
presented by the EHT collaboration hold only for unnaturally small values of
the absorption coefficient (i.e. much lower than $10^{-14}$), and thus have to
be significantly revised in scenarios with physical significance.

Abstract:  We explore the radial distribution of satellite galaxies in groups in the
Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the IllustrisTNG simulations.
Considering groups with masses $12.0 \leq \log_{10} (\mathcal{M}_h / h^{-1}
\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) < 14.8$ at $z<0.267$, we find a good agreement between GAMA
and a sample of TNG300 groups and galaxies designed to match the GAMA
selection. Both display a flat profile in the centre of groups, followed by a
decline that becomes steeper towards the group edge, and normalised profiles
show no dependence on group mass. Using matched satellites from TNG and dark
matter-only TNG-Dark runs we investigate the effect of baryons on satellite
radial location. At $z=0$, we find that the matched subhaloes from the TNG-Dark
runs display a much flatter radial profile: namely, satellites selected above a
minimum stellar mass exhibit both smaller halo-centric distances and longer
survival times in the full-physics simulations compared to their dark-matter
only analogues. We then divide the TNG satellites into those which possess
TNG-Dark counterparts and those which do not, and develop models for the radial
positions of each. We find the satellites with TNG-Dark counterparts are
displaced towards the halo centre in the full-physics simulations, and this
difference has a power-law behaviour with radius. For the `orphan' galaxies
without TNG-Dark counterparts, we consider the shape of their radial
distribution and provide a model for their motion over time, which can be used
to improve the treatment of satellite galaxies in semi-analytic and
semi-empirical models of galaxy formation.

Abstract:  The 840 kyr old pulsar PSR J1957+5033, detected so far only in $\gamma$- and

MK, a distance of $\la$1 kpc, and a small colour reddening excess $E(B-V)
\approx 0.03$. These properties make it an ideal candidate to detect in the
optical to get additional constraints on its parameters. We thus performed the
first deep optical observations of the pulsar with the 10.4-meter Gran
Telescopio Canarias in the $g'$ band and found its possible counterpart with
$g'=27.63\pm 0.26$. The counterpart candidate position is consistent with the
X-ray coordinates of the pulsar within the 0.5 arcsec accuracy. Assuming that
this is the real counterpart, we analysed the pulsar X-ray spectrum together
with the derived optical flux density. As a result, we found that the thermal
emission from the bulk surface of the cooling neutron star can significantly
contribute to its optical flux. Our multi-wavelength spectral analysis favours
the pulsar nature of the detected optical source, since it provides physically
adequate parameters of the pulsar emission. We show that the optical data can
provide new constraints on the pulsar temperature and distance.

the clustering cross-correlation signal between photometric galaxies and a
reference sample of galaxies with well-calibrated redshifts. Depending on the
effect on the clustering signal, the reassignment is either accepted or
rejected. By dynamically increasing the resolution of the SOM, the algorithm
eventually converges to a solution that minimises the number of mismatched
galaxies in each tomographic redshift bin and thus improves the compactness of
their corresponding redshift distribution. This method is demonstrated on the
synthetic LSST cosmoDC2 catalogue. We find a significant decrease in the
fraction of catastrophic outliers in the redshift distribution in all
tomographic bins, most notably in the highest redshift bin with a decrease in
the outlier fraction from 57 per cent to 16 per cent.

Title:Decaying warm dark matter revisited,"
Abstract:  Decaying dark matter models provide a physically motivated way of channeling
energy between the matter and radiation sectors. In principle, this could
affect the predicted value of the Hubble constant in such a way as to
accommodate the discrepancies between CMB inferences and local measurements of
the same. Here, we revisit the model of warm dark matter decaying
non-relativistically to invisible radiation. In particular, we rederive the
background and perturbation equations starting from a decaying neutrino model
and describe a new, computationally efficient method of computing the decay
product perturbations up to large multipoles. We conduct MCMC analyses to
constrain all three model parameters, for the first time including the mass of
the decaying species, and assess the ability of the model to alleviate the
Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, the latter being the discrepancy between the
CMB and weak gravitational lensing constraints on the amplitude of matter
fluctuations on an $8 h^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ scale. We find that the model reduces
the $H_0$ tension from $\sim 4 \sigma$ to $\sim 3 \sigma$ and neither
alleviates nor worsens the $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ tension,
ultimately showing only mild improvements with respect to $\Lambda$CDM.
However, the values of the model-specific parameters favoured by data is found
to be well within the regime of relativistic decays where inverse processes are
important, rendering a conclusive evaluation of the decaying warm dark matter
model open to future work.

Title:Automatic detection of long-duration transients in Fermi-GBM data,"
Abstract:  In the era of time-domain, multi-messenger astronomy, the detection of
transient events on the high-energy electromagnetic sky has become more
important than ever. Previous attempts to systematically search for
onboard-untriggered events in the data of Fermi-GBM have been limited to
short-duration signals with variability time scales smaller than ~1 min due to
the dominance of background variations on longer timescales. In this study, we
aim at the detection of slowly rising or long-duration transient events with
high sensitivity and full coverage of the GBM spectrum. We make use of our
earlier developed physical background model, propose a novel trigger algorithm
with a fully automatic data analysis pipeline. The results from extensive
simulations demonstrate that the developed trigger algorithm is sensitive down
to sub-Crab intensities, and has a near-optimal detection performance. During a
two month test run on real Fermi-GBM data, the pipeline detected more than 300
untriggered transient signals. For one of these transient detections we verify
that it originated from a known astrophysical source, namely the Vela X-1
pulsar, showing pulsed emission for more than seven hours. More generally, this
method enables a systematic search for weak and/or long-duration transients.

Title:Multi-frame blind deconvolution and phase diversity with statistical inclusion of uncorrected high-order modes,"
Abstract:  Images collected with ground-based telescopes suffer blurring and distortions
from turbulence in Earth's atmosphere. Adaptive optics (AO) can only partially
compensate for these effects. Neither multi-frame blind deconvolution (MFBD)
nor speckle techniques restore AO compensated images to the correct power
spectrum and contrast. MFBD can only compensate for a finite number of
low-order aberrations, leaving a tail of uncorrected high-order modes. Speckle
restoration of AO-corrected data depends on calibrations of the AO corrections
and assumptions regarding the height distribution of atmospheric turbulence. We
seek to develop an improvement to MFBD that combines speckle's usage of
turbulence statistics to account for high-order modes with the ability of MFBD
to sense low-order modes that can be partially corrected by AO and/or include
fixed or slowly changing instrumental aberrations. We modify the image
formation model, supplementing the fitted low-order wavefront aberrations with
tails of random high-order aberrations that follow Kolmogorov statistics,
scaled to estimated or measured values of Fried's parameter, r0, that
characterize the strength of the seeing at the moment of data collection. We
refer to this as statistical diversity (SD). We test MFBD with SD with
noise-free synthetic data, simulating many different r0 and numbers of
AO-corrected modes. SD improves the contrasts and power spectra of restored
images, both in accuracy and in consistency with varying r0, without penalty in
processing time. With focus diversity (FD), the results are almost perfect. SD
also reduces errors in the fitted wavefront parameters. MFBD with SD and FD
seems robust with respect to several percents of error in r0. Adding SD to MFBD
shows great promise for improving contrasts and power spectra in restored
images. Further studies with real data are motivated.

Title:SDSS-IV MaNGA: Identification and Multiwavelength Properties of Type-1 AGN in the DR15 sample,"
Abstract:  We present a method to identify type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the
central 3 arcsec integrated spectra of galaxies in the MaNGA DR15 sample. It is
based on flux ratios estimates in spectral bands flanking the expected
H$\alpha$ broad component H$\alpha_{BC}$. The high signal-to-noise ratio
obtained (mean S/N = 84) permits the identification of H$\alpha_{BC}$ without
prior subtraction of the host galaxy (HG) stellar component. A final sample of
47 type-1 AGN is reported out of 4700 galaxies at $z$ < 0.15. The results were
compared with those from other methods based on the SDSS DR7 and MaNGA data.
Detection of type-1 AGN in those works compared to our method goes from 26% to
81%. Spectral indexes were used to classify the type-1 AGN spectra according to
different levels of AGN-HG contribution, finding 9 AGN-dominated, 14
intermediate, and 24 HG-dominated objects. Complementary data in NIR-MIR
allowed us to identify type I AGN-dominated objects as blue and HG-dominated as
red in the WISE colors. From NVSS and FIRST radio continuum data, we identify 5
HERGs (high-excitation radio galaxies) and 4 LERGs (low-excitation radio
galaxies), three showing evidence of radio-jets in the FIRST maps. Additional
X-ray data from ROSAT allowed us to build [OIII] and H$\alpha_{BC}$ versus
X-ray, NIR-MIR, and radio continuum diagrams, showing that L(H$\alpha_{BC}$)
and L([OIII]) provide good correlations. The range in H$\alpha_{BC}$ luminosity
is wide 38 < logL(H$\alpha_{BC}$) < 44, with log FWHM(H$\alpha_{BC}$)$\sim$
3-4, covering a range of Eddington ratios of -5.15 < log L$_{bol}$/L$_{edd}$ <
0.70. Finally, we also identify and report ten possible changing-look AGN
candidates.

Title:Galaxy Pairs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey XV: Properties of Ionised Outflows,"
Abstract:  Powerful outflows are thought to play a critical role in galaxy evolution and
black hole growth. We present the first large-scale systematic study of ionised
outflows in paired galaxies and post-mergers compared to a robust control
sample of isolated galaxies. We isolate the impact of the merger environment to
determine if outflow properties depend on merger stage. Our sample contains
$\sim$4,000 paired galaxies and $\sim$250 post-mergers in the local universe
($0.02 \leq z \leq 0.2$) from the SDSS DR 7 matched in stellar mass, redshift,
local density of galaxies, and [OIII] $\lambda$5007 luminosity to a control
sample of isolated galaxies. By fitting the [OIII] $\lambda$5007 line, we find
ionised outflows in $\sim$15 per cent of our entire sample. Outflows are much
rarer in star-forming galaxies compared to AGN, and outflow incidence and
velocity increase with [OIII] $\lambda$5007 luminosity. Outflow incidence is
significantly elevated in the optical+mid-infrared selected AGN compared to
purely optical AGN; over 60 per cent show outflows at the highest luminosities
($L_{\mathrm{[OIII] \lambda5007}}$ $\gtrsim$ 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$),
suggesting mid-infrared AGN selection favours galaxies with powerful outflows,
at least for higher [OIII] $\lambda$5007 luminosities. However, we find no
statistically significant difference in outflow incidence, velocity, and
luminosity in mergers compared to isolated galaxies, and there is no dependence
on merger stage. Therefore, while interactions are predicted to drive gas
inflows and subsequently trigger nuclear star formation and accretion activity,
when the power source of the outflow is controlled for, the merging environment
has no further impact on the large-scale ionised outflows as traced by [OIII]
$\lambda5007$.

Title:Evolution of Main-Sequence-like Surviving Companions in Type Ia Supernova Remnants,"
Abstract:  Recent theoretical and numerical studies of Type Ia supernova explosion
within the single-degenerate scenario suggest that the non-degenerate
companions could survive during the supernova impact and could be detectable in
nearby supernova remnants. However, observational efforts show less promising
evidence on the existence of surviving companions from the standard
single-degenerate channels. The spin-up/spin-down models are possible
mechanisms to explain the non-detection of surviving companions. In these
models, the spin-up phase could increase the critical mass for explosion,
leading to a super-Chandrasekhar mass explosion, and the spin-down phase could
lead to extra mass loss and angular momentum redistribution. Since the
spin-down timescale for the delayed explosion of a rotating white dwarf is
unclear, in this paper, we explore a vast parameter space of main-sequence-like
surviving companions via two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of supernova
impact and the subsequent stellar evolution of surviving companions. Tight
universal relations to describe the mass stripping effect, supernova kick, and
depth of supernova heating are provided. Our results suggest that the not-yet
detected surviving companions from observations of nearby Type Ia supernova
remnants might favor low mass companions, short binary separation, or stronger
supernova explosion energies than the standard singe-degenerate channels.

Title:Discriminative Dimensionality Reduction using Deep Neural Networks for Clustering of LIGO Data,"
Abstract:  In this paper, leveraging the capabilities of neural networks for modeling
the non-linearities that exist in the data, we propose several models that can
project data into a low dimensional, discriminative, and smooth manifold. The
proposed models can transfer knowledge from the domain of known classes to a
new domain where the classes are unknown. A clustering algorithm is further
applied in the new domain to find potentially new classes from the pool of
unlabeled data. The research problem and data for this paper originated from
the Gravity Spy project which is a side project of Advanced Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). The LIGO project aims at
detecting cosmic gravitational waves using huge detectors. However non-cosmic,
non-Gaussian disturbances known as ""glitches"", show up in gravitational-wave
data of LIGO. This is undesirable as it creates problems for the gravitational
wave detection process. Gravity Spy aids in glitch identification with the
purpose of understanding their origin. Since new types of glitches appear over
time, one of the objective of Gravity Spy is to create new glitch classes.
Towards this task, we offer a methodology in this paper to accomplish this.

Title:An Expanding Shell of Neutral Hydrogen Associated with SN 1006: Hints for the Single-Degenerate Origin and Faint Hadronic Gamma-Rays,"
Abstract:  We report new HI observations of the Type Ia supernova remnant SN 1006 using
the Australia Telescope Compact Array with an angular resolution of $4.5'
\times 1.4'$ ($\sim$2 pc at the assumed SNR distance of 2.2 kpc). We find an
expanding gas motion in position-velocity diagrams of HI with an expansion
velocity of $\sim$4 km s$^{-1}$ and a mass of $\sim$1000 $M_\odot$. The spatial
extent of the expanding shell is roughly the same as that of SN 1006. We here
propose a hypothesis that SN 1006 exploded inside the wind-blown bubble formed
by accretion winds from the progenitor system consisting of a white dwarf and a
companion star, and then the forward shock has already reached the wind wall.
This scenario is consistent with the single-degenerate model. We also derived
the total energy of cosmic-ray protons $W_\mathrm{p}$ to be only $\sim$1.2-$2.0
\times 10^{47}$ erg by adopting the averaged interstellar proton density of
$\sim$25 cm$^{-3}$. The small value is compatible with the relation between the
age and $W_\mathrm{p}$ of other gamma-ray supernova remnants with ages below
$\sim$6 kyr. The $W_\mathrm{p}$ value in SN 1006 will possibly increase up to
several 10$^{49}$ erg in the next $\sim$5 kyr via the cosmic-ray diffusion into
the HI wind-shell.

Title:Vetting the Lobster Diagram: Searching for Unseen Companions in Wide Binaries using NASA Space Exoplanet Missions,"
Abstract:  Over the past decade, the number of known wide binary systems has
exponentially expanded thanks to the release of data from the Gaia Mission.
Some of these wide binary systems are actually higher-order multiples, where
one of the components is an unresolved binary itself. One way to search for
these systems is by identifying overluminous components in the systems. In this
study, we examine 4947 K+K wide binary pairs from the SUPERWIDE catalog and
quantify the relative color and luminosity of the components to find evidence
for additional, unresolved companions. The method is best illustrated in a
graph we call the ""Lobster diagram."" To confirm that the identified
overluminous components are close binary systems, we cross-match our wide
binaries with the TESS, K2 and Kepler archives and search for the signs of
eclipses and fast stellar rotation modulation in the light curves. We find that
$78.9\%\pm20.7\%$ of the wide binaries which contain an eclipsing system are
identified to be overluminous in the ""Lobster Diagram"" and $73.5\%\pm12.4\%$ of
the wide binaries which contain a component showing fast rotation ($P<5$) days
also show an overluminous component. From these results, we calculate a revised
lower limit on the higher-order multiplicity fraction for K+K wide binaries of
$40.0\%\pm1.6\%$. We also examine the higher-order multiplicity fraction as a
function of projected physical separation and metallicity. The fraction is
unusually constant as a function of projected physical separation while we see
no statistically significant evidence that the fraction varies with
metallicity.

Title:Inferring Quadrupolar Dynamo Mode from Sunspot Statistics,"
Abstract:  Observations of long-term north-south asymmetry in solar activity demand the
equator-symmetric (quadrupolar) mode be present in the solar magnetic field in
line with the dominant antisymmetric (dipolar) mode. This paper proposes
treating the sunspot area as a proxy for subsurface toroidal magnetic flux to
infer the quadrupolar mode of the solar dynamo from sunspot data. Toroidal
pseudo-fluxes (PF) in the northern and southern hemispheres are defined as a
signed sunspot area with plus or minus sign prescribed to them in accord with
the Hale's sunspot polarity rules. Statistical correlation analysis and wavelet
analysis of so-defined PFs reveal quadrupolar oscillations with a period of
about 16 yr and amplitude of about 0.17 relative to the amplitude of the
dominant 22-yr dipolar mode.

Title:Impacts of viscous dissipation on collisional growth and fragmentation of dust aggregates,"
Abstract:  Understanding the collisional behavior of dust aggregates consisting of
submicron-sized grains is essential to unveiling how planetesimals formed in
protoplanetary disks. It is known that the collisional behavior of individual
dust particles strongly depends on the strength of viscous dissipation force;
however, impacts of viscous dissipation on the collisional behavior of dust
aggregates have not been studied in detail, especially for the cases of oblique
collisions. Here we investigated the impacts of viscous dissipation on the
collisional behavior of dust aggregates. We performed numerical simulations of
collisions between two equal-mass dust aggregates with various collision
velocities and impact parameters. We also changed the strength of viscous
dissipation force systematically. We found that the threshold collision
velocity for the fragmentation of dust aggregates barely depends on the
strength of viscous dissipation force when we consider oblique collisions. In
contrast, the size distribution of fragments changes significantly when the
viscous dissipation force is considered. We obtained the empirical fitting
formulae for the size distribution of fragments for the case of strong
dissipation, which would be useful to study the evolution of size and spatial
distributions of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks.

Title:Early Dark Energy from a Higher-dimensional Gauge Theory,"
Abstract:  The Hubble constant estimated from the CMB measurements shows large
disagreement with the locally measured value. This inconsistency is called the
Hubble tension and is vastly studied in recent years. Early Dark Energy (EDE)
gives a few percent contribution to the total energy density of the universe
only at an epoch before the recombination, and it is considered as a promising
solution to the tension. A simple realization of EDE is given by dynamics of a
scalar field, called the EDE scalar, and models including the EDE scalar are
extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we present a novel EDE
scenario based on higher-dimensional gauge theories. An extra component of
gauge fields associated with a compact extra dimension behaves as the EDE
scalar at low-energy and has a periodic potential, which has a similar form as
potentials for pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons (PNGB). In a five-dimensional U(1)
gauge theory, we show that a scalar field that originates from the gauge field
can give EDE through its dynamics in a PNGB type potential with a suitable
choice of parameters in the theory. We focus on the scenario where EDE is
explained by the scalar field and clarify constraints on the fundamental
parameters of the gauge theory, such as the gauge coupling, the
compactification scale, and the mass parameters for matter fields. We also find
that a sufficient dilution of EDE requires non-trivial relations among U(1)
charges of matter fields. With specific matter contents, we numerically solve
the time evolution of the scalar field and confirm that its energy density
behaves as an EDE. In our scenario, the parameters of the gauge theory and
predicted properties of EDE are related to each other. Thus, the cosmological
restrictions on the EDE properties provide insights into higher-dimensional
gauge theories.

Title:Modeling the effectiveness of radiation shielding materials for astronaut protection on Mars,"
Abstract:  The surface of Mars is bombarded by energetic charged particles of solar and
galactic origin with little shielding offered by a thin atmosphere and lack of
a global magnetic field. As space agencies around the globe are planning for
crewed missions to the planet, one has to account for a number of factors, a
major one being the impact of ionizing radiation on astronaut health. Keeping
optimal exposure below acceptable radiation dose levels is crucial for good
health and survival of the crew. In this study, our goal is to understand the
radiation environment of Mars and describe the main strategies to be adopted to
protect astronauts from the harmful impacts of cosmic radiation. Specifically,
we investigate the shielding properties of various materials in the Martian
radiation field (Solar Energetic Particles and Galactic Cosmic Rays) using the
GEANT4 numerical model. Our results indicate that H-rich materials show a
similar response against cosmic rays and are the best shields, whereas regolith
has an intermediate behavior and therefore could be used as an additional
option, considering its practicability. Additionally, we show that although
aluminum is not as effective as other materials, it could nonetheless be
helpful when combined with other materials.

Title:The star formation history of a Galactic halo building block: The Helmi streams,"
Abstract:  We aim to determine the star formation history (SFH) of the progenitor of the
Helmi streams. From the 5D Gaia EDR3 data set, we extract local samples of
stars dominated by the Helmi streams, and the Galactic (thick and thin) disc
and halo. We do this by identifying regions in a pseudo-Cartesian velocity
space (obtained by setting line-of-sight velocities to zero), where stars
belonging to these components, as identified in samples with 6D phase-space
information, are predominantly found. We make use of an updated absolute
colour-magnitude diagram (aCMD) fitting methodology to contrast, for the first
time, the SFH of a disrupted accreted system -- the Helmi streams -- to that of
the average Milky Way inner halo. To this end, special attention is given to
the correct characterisation of Gaia completeness effects and observational
errors on the aCMD. We find that the progenitor of the Helmi streams
experienced an early star formation but which was sustained for longer (until
7-9~Gyr ago) than for the Milky Way halo (10-11 Gyr ago). As a consequence,
half of its stellar mass was in place $\sim$ 0.7 Gyr later. The quenching of
star formation in the Helmi streams progenitor, together with some hints of a
star formation burst at $\sim$8 Gyr, suggest it was accreted by the Milky Way
around this time, in concert with previous estimates based on the dynamics of
the streams.

Title:Stellar populations of the globular cluster NGC 5053 investigated using AstroSat-Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope,"
Abstract:  Globular clusters being old and densely packed serve as ideal laboratories to
test stellar evolution theories. Although there is enormous literature on
globular clusters in optical bands, studies in the ultraviolet (UV) regime are
sparse. In this work, we study the stellar populations of a metal poor and a
rather dispersed globular cluster, NGC 5053, using the UV instrument of
AstroSat, namely the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope in three far-UV (F154W,
F169M, F172M) and three near-UV (N219M, N245M, N263M) filters. Photometry was
carried out on these images to construct a catalogue of UV stars, of which the
cluster members were identified using Gaia EDR3 catalogue. UV and optical CMDs
help us locate known stellar populations such as BHB stars, RR-Lyrae stars, RHB
stars, BSSs, SX-Phe, RGB and AGB stars. Based on their locations in the CMDs,
we have identified 8 new BSS candidates, 6 probable eBSSs, and an EHB
candidate. Their nature has been confirmed by fitting their spectral energy
distributions with stellar atmospheric models. We believe the BSS population of
this cluster is likely to have a collisional origin based on our analyses of
their radial distribution and SEDs. BaSTI-IAC isochrones were generated to
characterize the cluster properties, and we find that the observed brightness
and colours of cluster members are best-fit with a model that is alpha-enhanced
with a helium fraction of 0.247, metallicity of -1.9 dex and age within a range
of 10.5-14.5 Gyr.

Title:Fundamental physics with ESPRESSO: Constraints on Bekenstein and dark energy models from astrophysical and local probes,"
Abstract:  Dynamical scalar fields in an effective four-dimensional field theory are
naturally expected to couple to the rest of the theory's degrees of freedom,
unless some new symmetry is postulated to suppress these couplings. In
particular, a coupling to the electromagnetic sector will lead to spacetime
variations of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$. Astrophysical tests of the
space-time stability of $\alpha$ are therefore a powerful probe of new physics.
Here we use ESPRESSO and other contemporary measurements of $\alpha$, together
with background cosmology data, local laboratory atomic clock and Weak
Equivalence Principle measurements, to place stringent constraints on the
simplest examples of the two broad classes of varying $\alpha$ models:
Bekenstein models and quintessence-type dark energy models, both of which are
parametric extensions of the canonical $\Lambda$CDM model. In both cases,
previously reported constraints are improved by more than a factor of ten. This
improvement is largely due to the very strong local constraints, but
astrophysical measurements can help to break degeneracies between cosmology and
fundamental physics parameters.

be binary or multiple, and old clusters are essentially single. To this end, we
revisit all the remaining binary cluster candidates in the Galaxy having at
least one cluster older than 100 Myr through Gaia data and careful revision of
the literature. We have found no convincing case for an old binary system among
the 120 pairs/groups revised. Most of the pairs are optical pairs or flyby
encounters. However, we have found three dubious pairs that could falsify the
title hypothesis upon further research. We also have found two possible
primordial pairs older than expected. Our results confirm that the vast
majority of binary/multiple OCs in the Galaxy, if not all, are of primordial
origin and are not stable for a long time. This finding is in line with similar
studies of the Magellanic Clouds and theoretical N-body simulations in the
Galaxy. The pairs of OCs in these groups are generally not binary systems since
they are not gravitationally bound. We also point out some inconsistencies in
previous works and databases, such as false open clusters and duplicities.

the telescopes located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory and revisit
spectroscopic data that have already been published. We study the
characteristics of the NUV-VIS reflectance spectra of primitive asteroids,
focusing on data of the Themis family and the Polana-Eulalia family complex.
Finally, we compare the NUV characteristics of these families with (162173)
Ryugu and (101955) Bennu. In this work, we also study systematic effects due to
the use of the five commonly used stars in Landolt's catalog as solar analogs
to obtain the asteroid reflectance in the NUV wavelength range. We compare the
spectra of five G-stars in Landolt's catalog with the spectrum of the
well-studied solar analog Hyades 64, also observed on the same nights. Results.
We find that many widely used Landolt's G-type stars are not solar analogs in
the NUV wavelength spectral region and thus are not suitable for obtaining the
reflectance spectra of asteroids. We also find that, even though the Themis
family and the Polana-Eulalia family complex show a similar blueness at visible
wavelengths, the NUV absorption of the Themis family is much deeper than that
of the Polana-Eulalia family complex. We did not find significant differences
between the New Polana and Eulalia families in terms of the NUV-VIS slope.

Title:Photometric studies on the host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts using 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope,"
Abstract:  In this article, we present multi-band photometric observations and analysis
of the host galaxies for a sample of five interesting gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
observed using the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) and the back-end
instruments. The host galaxy observations of GRBs provide unique opportunities
to estimate the stellar mass, ages, star-formation rates, and other vital
properties of the burst environments and hence progenitors. We performed a
detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the five host galaxies
using an advanced tool called Prospector, a stellar population synthesis model.
Furthermore, we compared the results with a larger sample of well-studied host
galaxies of GRBs, supernovae, and normal star-forming galaxies. Our SED
modeling suggests that GRB 130603B, GRB 140102A, GRB 190829A, and GRB 200826A
have massive host galaxies with high star formation rates (SFRs). On the other
hand, a supernovae-connected GRB 030329 has a rare low-mass galaxy with a low
star formation rate. We also find that GRB 190829A has the highest (in our
sample) amount of visual dust extinction and gas in its local environment of
the host, suggesting that the observed very high energy emission from this
burst might have a unique local environment. Broadly, the five GRBs in our
sample satisfy the typical correlations between host galaxies parameters and
these physical parameters are more common to normal star-forming galaxies at
the high-redshift Universe. Our results also demonstrate the capabilities of
3.6m DOT and the back-end instruments for the deeper photometric studies of the

Title:Improved Constraints on Cosmic Birefringence from the WMAP and Planck Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Data,"
Abstract:  The observed pattern of linear polarization of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) photons is a sensitive probe of physics violating parity
symmetry under inversion of spatial coordinates. A new parity-violating
interaction might have rotated the plane of linear polarization by an angle
$\beta$ as the CMB photons have been traveling for more than 13 billion years.
This effect is known as ""cosmic birefringence."" In this paper, we present new
measurements of cosmic birefringence from a joint analysis of polarization data
from two space missions, Planck and WMAP. This dataset covers a wide range of
frequencies from 23 to 353 GHz. We measure $\beta =
0.342^{\circ\,+0.094^\circ}_{\phantom{\circ\,}-0.091^\circ}$ (68% C.L.) for
nearly full-sky data, which excludes $\beta=0$ at 99.987% C.L. This corresponds
to the statistical significance of $3.6\sigma$. There is no evidence for
frequency dependence of $\beta$. We find a similar result, albeit with a larger
uncertainty, when removing the Galactic plane from the analysis.

Title:Testing for spectral index variations in polarised CMB foregrounds,"
Abstract:  We present a Bayesian parametric component separation method for polarised
microwave sky maps. We solve jointly for the primary cosmic microwave
background (CMB) signal and the main Galactic polarised foreground components.
For the latter, we consider electron-synchrotron radiation and thermal dust
emission, modelled in frequency as a power law and a modified blackbody
respectively. We account for inter-pixel correlations in the noise covariance
matrices of the input maps and introduce a spatial correlation length in the
prior matrices for the spectral indices beta. We apply our method to
low-resolution polarised Planck 2018 Low and High Frequency Instrument
(LFI/HFI) data, including the SRoll2 re-processing of HFI data. We find
evidence for spatial variation of the synchrotron spectral index, and no
evidence for depolarisation of dust. Using the HFI SRoll2 maps, and applying
wide priors on the spectral indices, we find a mean polarised synchrotron
spectral index over the unmasked sky of beta-sync = -2.833 +- 0.620. For
polarised dust emission, we obtain beta-dust = 1.429 +- 0.236. Our method
returns correlated uncertainties for all components of the sky model. Using our
recovered CMB maps and associated uncertainties, we constrain the optical depth
to reionization, tau, using a cross-spectrum-based likelihood-approximation
scheme (momento) to be tau = 0.0598 +- 0.0059. We confirm our findings using a
pixel-based likelihood (pixlike). In both cases, we obtain a result that is
consistent with, albeit a fraction of a sigma higher than, that found by
subtracting spatially uniform foreground templates. While the latter method is
sufficient for current polarisation data from Planck, next-generation
space-borne CMB experiments will need more powerful schemes such as the one
presented here.

Title:Properties of the radius valley around low mass stars: Predictions from the core-powered mass-loss mechanism,"
Abstract:  In recent years, analyzing the bimodality in the size distribution of small
planets, i.e., the `radius valley', has given us unprecedented insight into the
planet formation process. Here we explore the properties of the radius valley
for low mass stars, assuming that the core-powered mass-loss is the dominant
process shaping the small exoplanet population. We show that the slope of
radius valley in the planet size-orbital period space, to first-order, does not
vary with stellar mass and has a negative slope of $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d
log}P \simeq -0.11$ even for stars as small as 0.1 $M_\odot$, as observed in
latest studies. Furthermore, we find that the slope of the radius valley in the
planet size-stellar mass space is $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}M_\ast \simeq (3
\zeta - 2)/36$ where $\zeta$ is given by the stellar mass-luminosity relation
$L_\ast \propto M_\ast^\zeta$. Because $\zeta$ is $\gtrsim$ 2 and increases
with stellar mass, we predict that the radius valley has a positive slope in
the planet size-stellar mass space across FGKM dwarfs. This slope, however,
decreases (increases) in magnitude towards lower (higher) mass stars, due to
the variation of $\zeta$ with stellar mass. While around 1.0 $M_\odot$ stars
the slope is $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}M_\ast \sim 0.37$, it is as low as
$\sim 0.13$ around 0.1 $M_\odot$ stars. In addition, we find that the radius
valley is narrower and less empty around lower mass stars. Finally, we show
that predictions for the radius valley for core-powered mass-loss and
photoevaporation become increasingly distinct for lower mass stars.

Title:The lure of sirens: joint distance and velocity measurements with third generation detectors,"
Abstract:  The next generation of detectors will detect gravitational waves from binary
neutron stars at cosmological distances, for which around a thousand
electromagnetic follow-ups may be observed per year. So far, most work devoted
to the expected cosmological impact of these standard sirens employed them only
as distance indicators. Only recently their use as tracers of clustering,
similar to what already proposed for supernovae, has been studied. Focusing on
the expected specifications of the Einstein Telescope (ET), we forecast here
the performance on cosmological parameters of future standard sirens as both
distance and density indicators, with emphasis on the linear perturbation
growth index and on spatial curvature. We improve upon previous studies in a
number of ways: a more detailed analysis of available telescope time, the
inclusion of more cosmological and nuisance parameters, the Alcock-Paczynski
correction, the use of sirens also as both velocity and density tracers, and a
more accurate estimation of the distance posterior. We find that the analysis
of the clustering of sirens improves the constraints on $H_0$ by 30% and on
$\Omega_{k0}$ by over an order of magnitude, with respect to their use merely
as distance indicators. With 5 years of joint ET and Rubin Observatory
follow-ups we could reach precision of 0.1 km/s/Mpc in $H_0$ and 0.02 in
$\Omega_{k0}$ using only data in the range $0<z<0.5$. We also find that the use
of sirens as tracers of density, and not only velocity, yields good
improvements on the growth of structure constraints.

Title:The Ancient Globular Clusters of NGC 1291,"
Abstract:  We present a new catalog of 81 ancient globular clusters (GCs) in the
early-type spiral (SB0/a) galaxy NGC 1291. Candidates have been selected from
B,V, and I band images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, which also reveal
17 younger (t < few x 100Myr) clusters. The luminosity function shows a peaked
shape similar to that found for GC systems in other spiral and elliptical
galaxies. The ancient clusters have a bimodal color distribution, with
approximately 65% (35%) of the population having blue (red) colors. The red,
presumably metal-rich GCs are more centrally concentrated, as expected for a
bulge population; while the blue, presumably metal-poor GCs, are more broadly
distributed, consistent with expectations of a halo population. The specific
frequency of GCs in NGC 1291 is higher than found previously in most spiral
galaxies. However, if we consider just the blue subpopulation, we find
Sn,blue=0.50 +/- 0.06, quite similar to that found for other spirals. This
result supports the hypothesis of a universal population of halo GCs in
spirals. The fraction of red GCs in NGC 1291, when compared with those found in
other galaxies, suggests that these correlate with host galaxy type rather than
with host galaxy luminosity.

Title:Star formation characteristics of CNN-identified post-mergers in the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS),"
Abstract:  The importance of the post-merger epoch in galaxy evolution has been
well-documented, but post-mergers are notoriously difficult to identify. While
the features induced by mergers can sometimes be distinctive, they are
frequently missed by visual inspection. In addition, visual classification
efforts are highly inefficient because of the inherent rarity of post-mergers
(~1% in the low-redshift Universe), and non-parametric statistical merger
selection methods do not account for the diversity of post-mergers or the
environments in which they appear. To address these issues, we deploy a
convolutional neural network (CNN) which has been trained and evaluated on
realistic mock observations of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG
simulations, to galaxy images from the Canada France Imaging Survey (CFIS),
which is part of the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey
(UNIONS). We present the characteristics of the galaxies with the highest
CNN-predicted post-merger certainties, as well as a visually confirmed subset
of 699 post-mergers. We find that post-mergers with high CNN merger
probabilities (p(x)>0.8) have an average star formation rate that is 0.1 dex
higher than a mass- and redshift-matched control sample. The SFR enhancement is
even greater in the visually confirmed post-merger sample, a factor of two
higher than the control sample.

Title:New DA white dwarf models for asteroseismology of ZZ Ceti stars,"
Abstract:  Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to infer the evolutionary status and
chemical stratification of white dwarf (WD) stars, and to explore the physical
processes that lead to their formation. This is particularly true for the
variable H-rich atmosphere (DA) WDs, known as DAV or ZZ Ceti stars. We present
a new grid of DA WD models that take into account the last advances in the
modeling and input physics of both the progenitor and the WD stars, thus
avoiding and improving several shortcomings present in the set of DA WD models
employed in the asteroseismological analyses of ZZ Ceti stars we carried out in
our previous works. These new models are derived from a self-consistent way
with the changes in the internal chemical distribution that result from the
mixing of all the core chemical components induced by mean molecular-weight
inversions, from $^{22}$Ne diffusion, Coulomb sedimentation, and from residual
nuclearburning. In addition, the expected nuclear-burning history and mixing
events along the progenitor evolution are accounted for, in particular the
occurrence of third dredge-up, which determines the properties of the core and
envelope of post-AGB and white dwarf stars, as well as the WD initial-final
mass relation. The range of H envelopes of our new ZZ star models extends from
log(M_H/M_*)= -4 to -5, to log(M_H/M_*)= -13.5. This allows, for the first
time, to consider seismological solutions for ZZ Ceti stars with extremely thin
H envelopes. Our new H-burning post-AGB models predict chemical profiles of O
and C near the stellar centre of ZZ Ceti stars substantially different from
those we used in our previous works. We find that the pulsation periods of $g$
modes and the mode-trapping properties of the new models differ significantly
from those characterizing the ZZ Ceti models of our previous works,
particularly for long periods.

Title:Searching for dark energy with the Sun,"
Abstract:  General extensions of General Relativity (GR) based on bona fide degrees of
freedom predict a fifth force which operates within massive objects, opening up
an exciting opportunity to perform precision tests of gravity at stellar
scales. Here, focusing on general scalar-tensor theories for dark energy, we
utilize the Sun as our laboratory and search for imprints of the fifth-force
effect on the solar equilibrium structure. With analytic results and numerical
simulations, we explain how the different solar regions offer powerful ways to
test gravity. Accounting for the delicate interplay between fifth force and
solar microphysics such as opacity, diffusion, equation of state and
metallicity, we demonstrate that the fifth force still leaves a sharp signature
on the solar sound speed, in a region where simple estimates of input physics
uncertainties become negligible. For general scalar-field extensions of GR,
known as (U-)DHOST, based solely on the observational helioseismic errors, our
analysis at the equilibrium level allows to place an approximate constraint on
the fifth-force coupling strength of $-10^{-3} \lesssim \mathcal{Y} \lesssim
5\cdot 10^{-4}$ at $2\sigma$. This result improves previous stellar constraints
by $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude, and should be confirmed and improved by future
helioseismic inversions in modified gravity combined with an elaborate
accounting of theoretical uncertainties. Our analysis can be applied to a wide
set of theories beyond GR, and also paves the way for helioseismic analyses in
this context. In this regard, we discuss how the solar radiative and convective
zone can be employed as promising laboratories to test generic theories of
gravity.

approximations to the pertinent likelihoods have decades of history in the

approximations are accurate, provide useful insight into individual sources and
populations, and enable powerful fast calculations which would otherwise be
inaccessible for population and low-latency parameter inference. We provide
Normal Approximate Likelihood (NAL) fits for each event published in the

Title:R-process viable outflows are suppressed in global alpha-viscosity models of collapsar disks,"
Abstract:  Collapsar disks have been proposed to be rich factories of heavy elements,
but the major question of whether their outflows are neutron-rich, and could
therefore represent significant sites of the rapid neutron-capture (r-)
process, or dominated by iron-group elements remains unresolved. We present the
first global models of collapsars that start from a stellar progenitor and
self-consistently describe the evolution of the disk, its composition, and its
outflows in response to the imploding stellar mantle, using energy-dependent M1
neutrino transport and an alpha-viscosity to approximate turbulent
angular-momentum transport. We find that a neutron-rich, neutrino-dominated
accretion flow (NDAF) is established only marginally--either for short times or
relatively low viscosities--because the disk tends to disintegrate into an
advective disk (ADAF) already at relatively high mass-accretion rates,
launching powerful outflows but preventing it from developing a hot, dense, and
therefore neutron-rich core. Viscous outflows disrupt the star within ~100s
with explosion energies close to that of hypernovae. If viscosity is neglected,
a stable NDAF with disk mass of about 1Msun is formed but is unable to release
neutron-rich ejecta, while it produces a relatively mild explosion powered by a
neutrino-driven wind blown off its surface. With ejecta electron fractions
close to 0.5, all models presumably produce large amounts of Ni56. Our results
suggest that collapsar models based on the alpha-viscosity are inefficient
r-process sites and that genuinely magnetohydrodynamic effects may be required
to generate neutron-rich outflows. A relatively weak effective viscosity
generated by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence would improve the prospects for
obtaining neutron-rich ejecta.

Title:On the diversity of magnetar-driven kilonovae,"
Abstract:  A non-negligible fraction of binary neutron star mergers are expected to form
long-lived neutron star remnants, dramatically altering the multi-messenger
signatures of a merger. Here, we extend existing models for magnetar-driven
kilonovae and explore the diversity of kilonovae and kilonova afterglows.
Focusing on the role of the (uncertain) magnetic field strength, we study the
resulting electromagnetic signatures as a function of the external dipolar and
internal toroidal fields. These two parameters govern, respectively, the
competition between magnetic-dipole spindown and gravitational-wave spindown
(due to magnetic-field deformation) of the rapidly-rotating remnant. We find
that even in the parameter space where gravitational-wave emission is dominant,
a kilonova with a magnetar central engine will be significantly brighter than
one without an engine, as this parameter space is where more of the spin-down
luminosity is thermalised. In contrast, a system with minimal
gravitational-wave emission will produce a kilonova that may be difficult to
distinguish from ordinary kilonovae unless early-epoch observations are
available. However, as the bulk of the energy in this parameter space goes into
accelerating the ejecta, such a system will produce a brighter kilonova
afterglow that will peak on shorter times. To effectively hide the presence of
the magnetar from the kilonova and kilonova afterglow, the rotational energy
inputted into the ejecta must be $\lesssim 10^{-3}-10^{-2} E_{\rm rot}$. We
discuss the different diagnostics available to identify magnetar-driven
kilonovae in serendipitous observations and draw parallels to other potential
magnetar-driven explosions, such as superluminous supernovae and broad-line
supernovae Ic.

"Title:Disconnecting the Dots: Re-Examining the Nature of Stellar ""Strings"" in the Milky Way","
Abstract:  Recent analyses of Gaia data have resulted in the identification of new
stellar structures, including a new class of extended stellar filaments called
stellar ""strings"", first proposed by Kounkel and Covey 2019. We explore the
spatial, kinematic, and chemical composition of strings to demonstrate that
these newfound structures are largely inconsistent with being physical objects
whose members share a common origin. Examining the 3D spatial distribution of
string members, we find that the spatial dispersion around the claimed string
spine does not improve in the latest Gaia DR3 data release -- despite tangible
gains in the signal-to-noise of the parallax measurements -- counter to
expectations of a bona fide structure. Using the radial velocity dispersion of
the strings (averaging $\rm\sigma_{V_r} = 16\;km\;s^{-1}$) to estimate their
virial masses, we find that all strings are gravitationally unbound. Given the
finding that the strings are dispersing, the reported stellar ages of the
strings are typically $120\times$ larger than their measured dispersal times.
Finally, we validate prior work that stellar strings are more chemically
homogeneous than their local field stars, but show it is possible to obtain the
same signatures of chemical homogeneity by drawing random samples of stars from
spatially, temporally, and kinematically unrelated open clusters. Our results
show that while some strings may be composed of real sub-structures, there is
no consistent evidence for larger string-like connections over the sample.
These results underline the need for caution in over-interpreting the
significance of these strings and their role in understanding the star
formation history of the Milky Way.

Title:Implications of a Temperature Dependent IMF II: An Updated View of the Star-Forming Main Sequence,"
Abstract:  The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is predicted to depend upon the
temperature of gas in star-forming molecular clouds. The introduction of an
additional parameter, $T_{IMF}$ , into photometric template fitting, allows
galaxies to be fit with a range of IMFs. Three surprising new features appear:
(1) most star-forming galaxies are best fit with a bottom-lighter IMF than the
Milky Way; (2) most star-forming galaxies at fixed redshift are fit with a very
similar IMF; and (3) the most massive star-forming galaxies at fixed redshift
instead exhibit a less bottom-light IMF, similar to that measured in quiescent
galaxies. Additionally, since stellar masses and star formation rates both
depend on the IMF, these results slightly modify the resulting relationship,
while yielding similar qualitative characteristics to previous studies.

Title:Simultaneous X-ray and optical spectroscopy of V404 Cygni supports the multi-phase nature of X-ray binary accretion disc winds,"
Abstract:  Observational signatures of accretion disc winds have been found in a
significant number of low-mass X-ray binaries at either X-ray or optical
wavelengths. The 2015 outburst of the black hole transient V404 Cygni provided
a unique opportunity for studying both types of outflows in the same system. We
used contemporaneous X-ray (Chandra Observatory) and optical (Gran Telescopio
Canarias, GTC) spectroscopy, in addition to hard X-ray light curves (INTEGRAL).
We show that the kinetic properties of the wind, as derived from P-Cyg profiles
detected in the optical range at low hard X-ray fluxes and in a number of X-ray
transitions during luminous flares, are remarkably similar. Furthermore,
strictly simultaneous data taken at intermediate hard X-ray fluxes show
consistent emission line properties between the optical and the X-ray emission
lines, which most likely arise in the same accretion disc wind. We discuss
several scenarios to explain the properties of the wind, favouring the presence
of a dynamic, multi-phase outflow during the entire outburst of the system.
This study, together with the growing number of wind detections with fairly
similar characteristic velocities at different wavelengths, suggest that
wind-type X-ray binary outflows might be predominantly multi-phase in nature.

Title:Finding lensed direct-collapse black holes and supermassive primordial stars,"
Abstract:  Direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) may be the seeds of the first quasars,
over 200 of which have now been detected at $z > 6$ . The James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) could detect DCBHs in the near infrared (NIR) at $z \lesssim
20$ and probe the evolution of primordial quasars at their earliest stages, but
only in narrow fields that may not capture many of them. Wide-field NIR surveys
by Euclid and the Nancy Grace Roman Survey Telescope (RST) would enclose far
greater numbers of DCBHs but only directly detect them at $z \lesssim 6 - 8$
because of their lower sensitivities. However, their large survey areas will
cover thousands of galaxy clusters and massive galaxies that could
gravitationally lense flux from DCBHs, boosting them above current Euclid and
RST detection limits and revealing more of them than could otherwise be
detected. Here, we estimate the minimum number density of strongly lensed DCBHs
and supermassive primordial stars required for detection in surveys by Euclid,
RST and JWST at $z \lesssim 20$. We find that for reasonable estimates of host
halo numbers RST, Euclid, and JWST could potentially find hundreds of
strongly-lensed DCBHs at $z = 7 - 20$. RST would detect the most objects at $z
\lesssim 10$ and JWST would find the most at higher redshifts. Lensed
supermassive primordial stars could potentially also be found, but in fewer
numbers because of their short lifetimes.

Title:Predictive wavefront control on Keck II adaptive optics bench: on-sky coronagraphic results,"
Abstract:  The behavior of an adaptive optics (AO) system for ground-based high contrast
imaging (HCI) dictates the achievable contrast of the instrument. In conditions
where the coherence time of the atmosphere is short compared to the speed of
the AO system, the servo-lag error can become the dominant error term of the AO
system. While the AO system measures the wavefront error and subsequently
applies a correction (typically taking a total of one or a few milliseconds),
the atmospheric turbulence above the telescope has changed resulting in the
servo-lag error. In addition to reducing the Strehl ratio, the servo-lag error
causes a build-up of speckles along the direction of the dominant wind vector
in the coronagraphic image, severely limiting the contrast at small angular
separations. One strategy to mitigate this problem is to predict the evolution
of the turbulence over the delay time. Our predictive wavefront control
algorithm minimizes, in a mean square sense, the wavefront error over the delay
and has been implemented on the Keck II AO bench. In this paper, we report on
the latest results of our algorithm and discuss updates to the algorithm
itself. We explore how to tune various filter parameters based on both daytime
laboratory tests and on-sky tests. We show a reduction in the
residual-mean-square wavefront error for the predictor compared to the leaky
integrator (the standard controller for Keck) implemented on Keck for three
separate nights. Finally, we present contrast improvements for daytime and
on-sky tests for the first time. Using the L-band vortex coronagraph for Keck's
NIRC2 instrument, we find a contrast gain of up to 2 at a separation of 3
lambda/D and up to 3 for larger separations (3-7 lambda/D).

Title:The Great Dimming of Betelgeuse seen by the Himawari-8 meteorological satellite,"
Abstract:  Betelgeuse, one of the most studied red supergiant stars, dimmed in the
optical by ~1.2 mag between late 2019 and early 2020, reaching an historical
minimum called ""the Great Dimming."" Thanks to enormous observational effort to
date, two hypotheses remain that can explain the Dimming: a decrease in the
effective temperature and an enhancement of the extinction caused by newly
produced circumstellar dust. However, the lack of multi-wavelength monitoring
observations, especially in the mid infrared where emission from circumstellar
dust can be detected, has prevented us from closely examining these hypotheses.
Here we present 4.5-year, 16-band photometry of Betelgeuse between 2017-2021 in
the 0.45-13.5 micron wavelength range making use of images taken by the
Himawari-8 geostationary meteorological satellite. By examining the optical and
near-infrared light curves, we show that both a decreased effective temperature
and increased dust extinction may have contributed by almost the same amount to
the Great Dimming. Moreover, using the mid-infrared light curves, we find that
the enhanced circumstellar extinction actually contributed to the Dimming.
Thus, the Dimming event of Betelgeuse provides us an opportunity to examine the
mechanism responsible for the mass loss of red supergiants, which affects the
fate of massive stars as supernovae.

Title:The Covariance of Photometric and Spectroscopic Two-Point Statistics: Implications for Cosmological Parameter Inference,"
Abstract:  To combine information from measurements of the redshift-space power spectrum
from spectroscopic data with angular weak lensing, galaxy clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing power spectra from photometric surveys (i.e. the $3
\times 2$ point statistics), we must account for the covariance between the two
probes. Currently any covariance between the two types of measurements is
neglected as existing photometric and spectroscopic surveys largely probe
different cosmological volumes. This will cease to be the case as data arrives
from Stage-IV surveys. In this paper we derive an analytic expression for the
covariance between photometric 2D angular power spectra and the 3D
redshift-space power spectrum for Gaussian fields under the plane-parallel
approximation. We find that the two probes are covariant on large radial
scales, but because the information content of these modes is extremely low due
to sample variance, we forecast that it is safe to neglect this covariance when
performing cosmological parameter inference.

Title:Signatures of reionization feedback in the near-infrared background,"
Abstract:  The reionization of the intergalactic medium at redshifts $z\gtrsim 6$ is
expected to have a lasting impact on galaxies residing in low-mass dark matter
halos. Unable to accrete or retain gas photo-heated to temperatures $T \gtrsim
10^4$ K, the star formation histories of faint galaxies in the early Universe
are expected to decline as they exhaust their gas supply, resulting in a
turn-over in the galaxy luminosity function (LF) and a potential solution to
the missing satellites problem in the local group. Unfortunately, there are
several challenges to constraining `reionization feedback' empirically, most
notably that galaxies in low-mass halos are intrinsically faint, and that there
are other physical mechanisms capable of inducing a turn-over in the LF. In
this work, we investigate a new signature of reionization feedback that is in
principle distinct from other processes: as faint galaxies are quenched by
reionization, their stellar populations passively age and grow redder while the
brighter galaxies nearby continue to form stars at an increasing rate and so
remain relatively blue. We find that this contrast, between quenched and
un-quenched galaxies induces a scale and colour-dependent signature in the
present-day near-infrared background comparable to the expected sensitivity of
NASA's upcoming SPHEREx mission. Whereas models with pure mass suppression
largely affect the signal at wavelengths $\lesssim 2 \mu\rm{m}$, $\sim
5$%-level differences in the background persist out to $\sim 5 \mu\rm{m}$ for
reionization feedback models. Finally, the power spectra of intensity ratio
maps exhibit larger variations, and may thus be a promising target for future
analyses.

that bridge from the galaxy to the black hole, providing clues to the black
hole growth and host galaxy evolution. Over the past several decades, with the
commissioning of various ground, airborne and space IR observing facilities,
our interpretations of the AGN circumnuclear structures have advanced
significantly through improved understanding of how their dust emission changes
as a function of wavelength and how the heating of the dusty structures
responds to variations of the energy released from the central engine. In this
review, we summarize the current observational knowledge of the AGN IR
broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the IR time variability
behavior covering large ranges of AGN luminosity and redshift, and discuss some
first-order insights into the obscuring structures and host galaxy IR
properties that can be obtained by integrating the relevant observations into a
coherent picture.

Title:Characterizing the Variable X-ray and UV-Optical Flux Behavior of Blazars,"
Abstract:  The variability of blazars in the X-ray and optical regions informs both the
physics of their emitting region and places demands on the observer if a
program requires that the object be bright or faint. The extensive simultaneous
X-ray and optical observation by Swift provides the best insight into the
variable nature of these objects. This program uses \textit{Swift} data for 19
X-ray-bright blazars, generally at $z > 0.1$, to determine their variability
properties. The analysis is based on structure functions and provides insight
into the nature of the variability and how it depends on time, luminosity, and
redshift. We also consider strategies for observing blazars at or above average
brightness, given a time delay between planning an observation and obtaining
the data. This is critical to observations with orbiting X-ray telescopes,
current or future. The variability in the soft X-ray band is typically three to
eight times larger than at UV-optical wavelengths, at fixed time differences
(i.e., 30 or 100 days). There is almost no difference in the amplitude of
variation (X-ray or UV-optical) as a function of redshift (time delay of 30
days) and a modest positive correlation with luminosity. In the X-ray band,
blazars that become brighter than normal typically remain bright for at least
2-3 months, although with significant flickering. One can avoid observing
objects that are significantly below the average X-ray flux by scheduling the
observation when the $F_X > 0.9 F_{X,avg}$, which requires monitoring
observations near the time of the scheduling activity.

"Title:AGILE Observations of GRB 220101A: A ""New Year's Burst"" with an Exceptionally Huge Energy Release","
Abstract:  We report the AGILE observations of GRB 220101A, which took place at the
beginning of 1st January 2022 and was recognized as one of the most energetic
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) ever detected since their discovery. The AGILE
satellite acquired interesting data concerning the prompt phase of this burst,
providing an overall temporal and spectral description of the event in a wide
energy range, from tens of keV to tens of MeV. Dividing the prompt emission
into three main intervals, we notice an interesting spectral evolution,
featuring a notable hardening of the spectrum in the central part of the burst.
The average fluxes encountered in the different time intervals are relatively
moderate, with respect to those of other remarkable bursts, and the overall
fluence exhibits a quite ordinary value among the GRBs detected by MCAL.
However, GRB 220101A is the second farthest event detected by AGILE, and the
burst with the highest isotropic equivalent energy of the whole MCAL GRB
sample, releasing E_iso=2.54x10^54 erg and exhibiting an isotropic luminosity
of L_iso=2.34x10^52 erg/s (both in the 400 keV - 10 MeV energy range).
We also analyzed the first 10^6 s of the afterglow phase, using the publicly
available Swift XRT data, carrying out a theoretical analysis of the afterglow,
based on the forward shock model. We notice that GRB 220101A is with high
probability surrounded with a wind-like density medium, and that the energy
carried by the initial shock shall be a fraction of the total E_iso, presumably
near 50%.

Title:Taylor microscale and effective Reynolds number near the Sun from PSP,"
Abstract:  The Taylor microscale is a fundamental length scale in turbulent fluids,
representing the end of fluid properties and onset of dissipative processes.
The Taylor microscale can also be used to evaluate the Reynolds number in
classical turbulence theory. Although the solar wind is weakly collisional, it
approximately behaves as a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluid at scales larger
than the kinetic scale. As a result, classical fluid turbulence theory and
formalisms are often used to study turbulence in the MHD range. Therefore, a
Taylor microscale can be used to estimate an effective Reynolds number in the
solar wind. NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) has reached progressively closer to
the Sun than any other spacecraft before. The collected data have revealed many
new findings in the near-Sun solar wind. Here, we use the PSP data to estimate
the Taylor microscale and effective Reynolds number near the Sun. We find that
the Taylor microscale and Reynolds number are small compared to the
corresponding near-Earth values, indicating a solar wind that has been less
processed by turbulence, with very small-scale dissipative processes near the
Sun.

Title:NuSTAR Observations of AGN with Low Observed X-ray to [OIII] Luminosity Ratios: Heavily Obscured AGN or Turned-Off AGN?,"
Abstract:  Type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) show signatures of accretion onto a
supermassive black hole through strong, high-ionization, narrow emission lines
extended on scales of 100s to 1000s of parsecs, but they lack the broad
emission lines from close in to the black hole that characterize type 1 AGN.
The lack of broad emission could indicate obscuration of the innermost nuclear
regions, or could indicate that the black hole is no longer strongly accreting.
Since high-energy X-rays can penetrate thick obscuring columns, they have the
power to distinguish these two scenarios. We present high-energy NuSTAR
observations of 9 Seyfert 2 AGN from the IRAS 12 micron survey, supplemented
with low-energy X-ray observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift. The
galaxies were selected to have anomalously low observed 2-10 keV luminosities
compared to their [O III] optical luminosities, a traditional diagnostic of
heavily obscured AGN, reaching into the Compton-thick regime for the highest
hydrogen column densities ($N_{\rm H} > 1.5 \times 10^{24}\, {\rm cm}^{-2}$).
Based on updated [O III] luminosities and intrinsic X-ray luminosities based on
physical modeling of the hard X-ray spectra, we find that one galaxy was
misclassified as type 2 (NGC 5005) and most of the remaining AGN are obscured,
including three confirmed as Compton-thick (IC 3639, NGC 1386, and NGC 3982).
One galaxy, NGC 3627, appears to be recently deactivated. Compared to the
original sample the 9 AGN were selected from, this is a rate of approximately
1%. We also find a new X-ray changing-look AGN in NGC 6890.

Title:On the Hunt for the Origins of the Orphan--Chenab Stream: Detailed Element Abundances with APOGEE and Gaia,"
Abstract:  Stellar streams in the Galactic halo are useful probes of the assembly of
galaxies like the Milky Way. Many tidal stellar streams that have been found in
recent years are accompanied by a known progenitor globular cluster or dwarf
galaxy. However, the Orphan--Chenab (OC) stream is one case where a relatively
narrow stream of stars has been found without a known progenitor. In an effort
to find the parent of the OC stream, we use astrometry from the early third
data release of ESA's Gaia mission (Gaia EDR3) and radial velocity information
from the SDSS-IV APOGEE survey to find up to 13 stars that are likely members
of the OC stream. We use the APOGEE survey to study the chemical nature (for up
to 13 stars) of the OC stream in the $\alpha$ (O, Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, S), odd-Z
(Al, K, V), Fe-peak (Fe, Ni, Mn, Co, Cr) and neutron capture (Ce) elemental
groups. We find that the stars that make up the OC stream are not consistent
with a mono-metallic population and have a median metallicity of --1.92~dex
with a dispersion of 0.28 dex. Our results also indicate that the
$\alpha$-elements are depleted compared to the known Milky Way populations and
that its [Mg/Al] abundance ratio is not consistent with second generation stars
from globular clusters. The detailed chemical pattern of these stars indicates
that the OC stream progenitor is very likely to be a dwarf spheroidal galaxy
with a mass of ~10$^6$ M$_\odot$.

Title:The Common Envelope Evolution Outcome -- A Case Study on Hot Subdwarf B Stars,"
Abstract:  Common envelope evolution (CEE) physics plays a fundamental role in the
formation of binary systems, such as mergering stellar gravitational wave
sources, pulsar binaries and type Ia supernovae. A precisely constrained CEE
has become more important in the age of large surveys and gravitational wave
detectors. We use an adiabatic mass loss model to explore how the total energy
of the donor changes as a function of the remnant mass. This provides a more
self-consistent way to calculate the binding energy of the donor. For
comparison, we also calculate the binding energy through integrating the total
energy from the core to the surface. The outcome of CEE is constrained by total
energy conservation at the point at which both component's radii shrink back
within their Roche lobes. We apply our results to 142 hot subdwarf binaries.
For shorter orbital period sdBs, the binding energy is highly consistent. For
longer orbital period sdBs in our samples, the binding energy can differ by up
to a factor of 2. The CE efficiency parameter $\beta_\mathrm{CE}$ becomes
smaller than $\alpha_\mathrm{CE}$ for the final orbital period $\log_{10}
P_{\mathrm{orb}}/\mathrm{d} > -0.5$. We also find the mass ratios $\log_{10} q$
and CE efficiency parameters $\log_{10} \alpha_{\mathrm{CE}}$ and $\log_{10}
\beta_{\mathrm{CE}}$ linearly correlate in sdBs, similarly to De Marco et al.
(2010) for post-AGB binaries.

Title:Simulation of the isotropic ultra-high energy photons flux in the solar magnetic field,"
Abstract:  Both the lack of observation of ultra-high energy (UHE) photons and the
limitations of the state-of-the-art methodology being applied for their
identification motivate studies on alternative approaches to the relevant
simulations and the related observational strategies. One of such new
approaches is proposed in this report and it concerns new observables allowing
indirect identification of UHE photons through cosmic ray phenomena composed of
many spatially correlated extensive air showers or primary cosmic rays observed
at one time. The study is based on simulations of interactions of UHE photons
with the magnetic field of the Sun using the PRESHOWER program with some
essential modifications. One of the expected results of such interactions is a
generation of cosmic ray ensembles (CRE) in the form of very thin and very
elongated cascades of secondary photons of energies spanning the whole cosmic
ray energy spectrum. Upon entering the Earth's atmosphere, these cascades or
their parts may generate uniquely characteristic walls of spatially correlated
extensive air showers, and the effect is expected also in cases when primary
UHE photons are not directed towards the Earth. Particle distributions in these
multi-primary UHE photon footprints are expected to have thicknesses of the
order of meters and elongations reaching even hundreds of millions kilometers,
making them potentially observable with a global, multi-experiment approach,
including re-exploring of the historical data, with the expected event rate
exceeding the capabilities of even very large cosmic ray observatories. The
methods described in this report allow for simulating potentially observable
quantities related to CRE induced by UHE photons: densities, energy spectra and
geographical orientations of particles at the top of the Earth's atmosphere.

Title:Cupid Is Not Doomed Yet: On the Stability of the Inner Moons of Uranus,"
Abstract:  Some of the small inner moons of Uranus have very closely-spaced orbits.
Multiple numerical studies have found that the moons Cressida and Desdemona,
within the Portia sub-group, are likely to collide in less than 100 Myr. The
subsequent discovery of three new moons (Cupid, Perdita, and Mab) made the
system even more crowded. In particular, it has been suggested that the Belinda
group (Cupid, Belinda, and Perdita) will become unstable in as little as 10$^5$
years. Here we revisit the issue of the stability of the inner moons of Uranus
using updated orbital elements and considering tidal dissipation. We find that
the Belinda group can be stable on $10^8$-year timescales due to an orbital
resonance between Belinda and Perdita. We find that tidal evolution cannot form
the Belinda-Perdita resonance, but convergent migration could contribute to the
long-term instability of the Portia group. We propose that Belinda captured
Perdita into the resonance during the last episode of disruption and
re-accretion among the inner moons, possibly hundreds of Myr ago.

Title:Detection of Flare-induced Plasma Flows in the Corona of EV Lac with X-ray Spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  Stellar flares are characterized by sudden enhancement of electromagnetic
radiation from the atmospheres of stars. Compared to their solar counterparts,
our knowledge on the coronal plasma dynamics of stellar flares and their
connection to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) remains very limited. With
time-resolved high-resolution spectroscopic observations from the
\textit{Chandra} X-ray observatory, we detected noticeable coronal plasma flows
during several stellar flares on a nearby dMe star EV Lac. In the observed
spectra of O~{\sc{viii}} (3 MK), Fe~{\sc{xvii}} (6 MK), Mg~{\sc{xii}} (10 MK),
and Si~{\sc{xiv}} (16 MK) lines, these flare-induced upflows/downflows appear
as significant Doppler shifts of several tens to \speed{130}, and the upflow
velocity generally increases with temperature. Variable line ratios of the
Si~{\sc{xiii}} triplet reveal that these plasma flows in most flares are
accompanied by an increase of the coronal plasma density and temperature. We
interpret these results as X-ray evidences for chromospheric evaporation on EV
Lac. In two successive flares, the plasma flow pattern and a sharp increase of
the measured coronal density are highly suggestive of explosive evaporation.
The transition from redshifts to blueshifts in such an explosive evaporation
occurs at a temperature of at least 10 MK, much higher than that observed in
solar flares ($\sim$1 MK). However, in one flare the cool and warm upflows
appear to be accompanied by a decreasing plasma density, which might be
explained by a stellar filament/prominence eruption coupled to this flare.
These results provide important clues to understand the coronal plasma dynamics
during flares on M dwarfs.

Title:Flickering returns as RS Oph reestablishes quiescent conditions following its 2021 nova outburst,"
Abstract:  RS Oph has persistently displayed flickering at optical wavelengths when
observed away from its repeating nova outbursts. During the 2006 eruption the
flickering disappeared, and this repeated during the recent 2021 event. We have
been monitoring RS Oph looking for the reappearance of flickering at B-band
following the 2021 outburst. The flickering was still absent (sigma(B)<0.002
mag) on day +210 (counted from nova optical maximum), appeared at
sigma(B)=0.008 mag on day +224, and raised to sigma(B)=0.029 mag on day +250.
On following dates the amplitude remained large, although fluctuating. The
recovery of B-band quiescence brightness by RS Oph begun around day +225 and
was completed by day +260. The parallel patterns followed by the rise in system
brightness and the reappearance of flickering confirm the central role played
in RS Oph by the return to pre-outburst conditions of the accretion disk and
the refilling by the RG wind of the immediate circumstellar space.

Title:SPH simulations of high-speed collisions between asteroids and comets,"
Abstract:  We studied impact processes by means of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
simulations. The method was applied to modeling formation of main-belt families
during the cometary bombardment (either early or late, ${\sim}\,3.85\,{\rm Gy}$
ago). If asteroids were bombarded by comets, as predicted by the Nice model,
hundreds of asteroid families (catastrophic disruptions of diameter $D \ge
100\,{\rm km}$ bodies) should have been created, but the observed number is
only 20. Therefore we computed a standard set of 125 simulations of collisions
between representative $D = 100\,{\rm km}$ asteroids and high-speed icy
projectiles (comets). According to our results, the largest remnant mass
$M_{\rm lr}$ is similar as in low-speed collisions, due to appropriate scaling
with the effective strength $Q_{\rm eff}$, but the largest fragment mass
$M_{\rm lf}$ exhibits systematic differences - it is typically smaller for
craterings and bigger for super-catastrophic events. This trend does not,
however, explain the non-existence of old families. The respective parametric
relations can be used in other statistical (Monte-Carlo) models to better
understand collisions between asteroidal and cometary populations.

Abstract:  We present new observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array for a gravitationally-lensed galaxy at $z=9.1$, MACS1149-JD1. [O III]
88-$\mu$m emission is detected at 10$\sigma$ with a spatial resolution of
$\sim0.3$ kpc in the source plane, enabling the most distant morpho-kinematic
study of a galaxy. The [O III] emission is distributed smoothly without any
resolved clumps and shows a clear velocity gradient with $\Delta V_{\rm
obs}/2\sigma_{\rm tot}=0.84\pm0.23$, where $\Delta V_{\rm obs}$ is the observed
maximum velocity difference and $\sigma_{\rm tot}$ is the velocity dispersion
measured in the spatially-integrated line profile, suggesting a rotating
system. Assuming a geometrically thin self-gravitating rotation disk model, we
obtain $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_V=0.67_{-0.26}^{+0.73}$, where $V_{\rm rot}$ and
$\sigma_V$ are the rotation velocity and velocity dispersion, respectively,
still consistent with rotation. The resulting disk mass of
$0.65_{-0.40}^{+1.37}\times10^{9}$ M$_\odot$ is consistent with being
associated with the stellar mass identified with a 300 Myr-old stellar
population independently indicated by a Balmer break in the spectral energy
distribution. We conclude that the most of the dynamical mass is associated
with the previously-identified mature stellar population that formed at
$z\sim15$.

Title:Study of Asymptotic Velocity in the Bondi-Hoyle Accretion Flows in the Domain of Kerr and 4-D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravities,"
Abstract:  Understanding the physical structures of the accreated matter very close to
the black hole in quasars and active galactic nucleus (AGNs) is an important
milestone to constrain the activities occurring in their centers. In this
paper, we numerically investigate the effects of the asymptotic velocities on
the physical structures of the accretion disk around the Kerr and
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) rapidly rotating black holes. The Bondi-Hoyle
accretion is considered with a falling gas towards the black hole in upstream
region of the computational domain. The shock cones are naturally produced in
the downstream part of the flow around both black holes. It is found that the
structure of the cones and the amount of the accreated matter depend on
asymptotic velocity $V_{\infty}$ (Mach number) and the types of the gravities
(Kerr or EGB). Increasing the Mach number of the inflowing matter in the
supersonic region causes the shock opening angle and accretion rates getting
smaller because of the rapidly falling gas towards the black hole. The EGB
gravity leads to an increase in the shock opening angle of the shock cones
while the mass accretion rates $\dot{M}$ are decreasing in EGB gravity with a
Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling constant $\alpha$. It is also confirmed that
accretion rates and drag forces are significantly altered in the EGB gravity.
Our numerical simulation results could be used to identify the accreation
mechanism and physical properties of the accretion disk and black hole in the
observed $X-$ rays such as NGC $1313$ $X-1$ and $1313$ $X-2$ and MAXI

Title:The driving mode of shock-driven turbulence,"
Abstract:  Turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial in the process of star
formation. Shocks produced by supernova explosions, jets, radiation from
massive stars, or galactic spiral-arm dynamics are amongst the most common
drivers of turbulence in the ISM. However, it is not fully understood how
shocks drive turbulence, in particular whether shock driving is a more
solenoidal(rotational, divergence-free) or a more compressive (potential,
curl-free) mode of driving turbulence. The mode of turbulence driving has
profound consequences for star formation, with compressive driving producing
three times larger density dispersion, and an order of magnitude higher star
formation rate than solenoidal driving. Here, we use hydrodynamical simulations
of a shock inducing turbulent motions in a structured, multi-phase medium. This
is done in the context of a laser-induced shock, propagating into a foam
material, in preparation for an experiment to be performed at the National
Ignition Facility (NIF). Specifically, we analyse the density and velocity
distributions in the shocked turbulent medium, and measure the turbulence
driving parameter $b=(\sigma^{2 \Gamma}_{\rho /\langle \rho \rangle}-1)^{1/2}
(1-\sigma_{\rho \langle \rho
\rangle}^{-2})^{-1/2}\mathcal{M}^{-1}\Gamma^{-1/2}$ with the density dispersion
$\sigma_{\rho / \langle \rho \rangle}$, the turbulent Mach number
$\mathcal{M}$, and the polytropic exponent $\Gamma$. Purely solenoidal and
purely compressive driving correspond to $b \sim 1/3$ and $b \sim 1$,
respectively. Using simulations in which a shock is driven into a multi-phase
medium with structures of different sizes and $\Gamma < 1$, we find $b \sim 1$
for all cases, showing that shock-driven turbulence is consistent with strongly
compressive driving.

Abstract:  In strongly compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, obliqueness between
the large-scale density gradient and magnetic field gives an electromotive
force mediated by density variance (intensity of density fluctuation). This
effect is named ``magnetoclinicity'', and is expected to play an important role
in large-scale magnetic-field generation in astrophysical compressible
turbulent flows. Analysis of large-scale instability due to the
magnetoclinicity effect shows that the mean magnetic-field perturbation is
destabilised at large scales in the vicinity of strong mean density gradient in
the presence of density variance.

Abstract:  The recent ALMA maps together with observations of H$_2$O maser emission seem
to suggest the presence of a counter-rotation in the obscuring torus of
NGC1068. We propose to explain this phenomenon as due to the influence of a
wind and the effects of orientation. In order to test this idea: 1. we use
N-body simulation of a clumpy torus in the gravitational field of a
supermassive black hole taking into account mutual forces between clouds; 2. we
consider the influence of the asymmetrical wind on the clouds in the torus
throat. An axis of such a wind is tilted with respect to the torus symmetry
axis; 3. we apply ray-tracing algorithm to take into account the effects of
obscuration and of the torus orientation relative to an observer. By choosing
the AGN parameters corresponding to NGC1068 we obtain the model velocity maps
that emulate the effect of an apparent counter-rotation and can explain the
discovery made by ALMA.

Abstract:  Previous Ku-band (15 GHz) imaging with data obtained from the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) had shown two compact, sub-pc components at the location
of a presumed kpc-scale radio core in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7674. It was then
presumed that these two unresolved and compact components were dual radio cores
corresponding to two supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting surrounding gas
and launching radio-bright relativistic jets. However, utilizing the original
VLBA dataset used to claim the detection of a binary SMBH, in addition to later
multi-epoch/multi-frequency datatsets obtained from both the VLBA and the
European VLBI Network, we find no evidence to support the presence of a binary
SMBH. We place stringent upper limits to the flux densities of any sub-pc-scale
radio cores which are at least an order of magnitude lower than the original
VLBI radio-core detections, directly challenging the original binary SMBH
detection claim. With this in mind, we discuss the possible reasons for the
non-detection of any VLBI radio cores in our imaging, the possibility of a
binary SMBH still residing in NGC 7674, and the prospect of future observations
shedding further light on the true nature of this active galactic nucleus.

Title:Photometric [Fe/H] of RRab stars in the $G$ and $K_s$ bands by deep learning,"
Abstract:  RR Lyrae stars are useful chemical tracers thanks to the empirical
relationship between their heavy-element abundance and the shape of their light
curves. However, the consistent and accurate calibration of this relation
across multiple photometric wavebands has been lacking. We have devised a new
method for the metallicity estimation of fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars in the
Gaia optical $G$ and near-infrared VISTA $K_s$ wavebands by deep learning.
First, an existing metallicity prediction method is applied to large
photometric data sets, which are then used to train long short-term memory
recurrent neural networks for the regression of the [Fe/H] to the light curves
in other wavebands. This approach allows an unbiased transfer of our accurate,
spectroscopically calibrated $I$-band formula to additional bands at the
expense of minimal additional noise. We achieve a low mean absolute error of
$0.1$ dex and high $R^2$ regression performance of $0.84$ and $0.93$ for the
$K_s$ and $G$ bands, respectively, measured by cross-validation. The resulting
predictive models are deployed on the Gaia DR2 and VVV inner-bulge RR Lyrae
catalogs. We estimate mean metallicities of $-1.35$ dex for the inner bulge and
$-1.7$ for the halo, which are significantly less than values obtained by
earlier photometric prediction methods. Using our results, we establish a
public catalog of photometric metallicities of over 60,000 Galactic RR Lyrae
stars, and provide an all-sky map of the resulting RR Lyrae metallicity
distribution. The software code used for training and deploying our recurrent
neural networks is made publicly available in the open-source domain.

These phenomena are commonly seen in luminous objects with intermediate/high

and shifts with respect to the rest-frame leads to an evaluation of the role of
radiative forces in driving an accretion disk wind. While for non-jetted
quasars the wind properties have been extensively characterized as a function
of luminosity and other physical parameters, the situation is by far less clear
for jetted sources. The overarching issue is the effect of the relativistic
jets on the wind, and on the structure of the emitting region in general. We
present results from our analysis of the optical and UV line profiles aimed to
identifying the wind contribution to the line emission.

Title:How long can LBVs sleep? A long-term photometric vaiability and spectral study of the Galactic candidate luminous blue variable MN112,"
Abstract:  Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are massive stars that show strong spectral
and photometric variability. The question of what evolutionary stages they
represent and what exactly drives their instability is still open, and thus is
it important to understand whether LBVs without significant ongoing activity
exist, and for how long such dormant LBVs may ``sleep''. In this article we
investigate the long-term variability properties of the LBV candidate MN112, by
combining its optical and infrared spectral data covering 12 years with
photometric data covering nearly a century acquired by both modern time-domain
sky surveys and historical photographic plates. We analyze the spectra, derive
physical properties of the star by modelling its atmosphere and use a new
distance estimate from Gaia data release 3 (DR3) to determine the position of
MN112 both inside the Galaxy and in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. Distance
estimation increased in almost two times in comparison with Gaia DR2. Due to
that MN112 moved in upper part of the diagram and according to our modeling it
lies on evolutionary track for star with initial mass $M_*=70 M_\odot$ near
Humphreys--Davidson limit. Given the absence of any significant variability we
conclude that the star is a dormant LBV that has been inactive for at least a
century now.

Title:Infrared multiple-angle incidence resolution spectrometry for vapor-deposited amorphous water,"
Abstract:  Infrared (IR) multiple-angle incidence resolution spectrometry (IR-MAIRS) is
a recently developed spectroscopic technique that combines oblique incidence
transmission measurements and chemometrics (multivariate analysis) to obtain
both pure in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OP) vibration spectra for a thin
sample. IR-MAIRS is established for analyzing the molecular orientation of
organic thin films at atmospheric pressure, but it should also be powerful for
the structural characterization of vapor-deposited thin samples prepared in a
vacuum. The application of IR-MAIRS to vapor-deposited amorphous water is
particularly interesting in the fields of physical and interstellar chemistry,
because it is a representative model material for interstellar icy dust grains.
We recently developed an experimental setup for in situ IR-MAIRS under
low-temperature, ultra-high-vacuum conditions, which thus facilitates
measurements of interstellar ice analogues such as vapor-deposited amorphous
water. This review considers the theoretical framework of IR-MAIRS and our
recent experimental results for vapor-deposited amorphous water. We present
spectroscopic signatures for the perpendicular orientation of dangling OH bonds
for three-coordinated water molecules at the surface of amorphous water at 90
K. The absolute absorption cross-section of the three-coordinated dangling OH
bonds is quantitatively measured. As IR-MAIRS can essentially be conducted
using only a Fourier-transform IR spectrometer and an angle-controllable linear
polarizer, it is a useful, low-cost, and simple spectroscopic technique for
studying laboratory analogues of interstellar ices including vapor-deposited
amorphous water.

"Title:First discoveries and localisations of Fast Radio Bursts with MeerTRAP: a real-time, commensal MeerKAT survey","
Abstract:  We report on the discovery and localization of fast radio bursts (FRBs) from
the MeerTRAP project, a commensal fast radio transient-detection programme at
MeerKAT in South Africa. Our hybrid approach combines a coherent search with an
average field-of-view of 0.4 $\rm deg^{2}$ with an incoherent search utilizing
a field-of-view of $\sim$1.27 $\rm deg^{2}$ (both at 1284~MHz). Here, we
present results on the first three FRBs: FRB 20200413A (DM=1990.05 pc
cm$^{-3}$), FRB 20200915A (DM=740.65 pc cm$^{-3}$), and FRB 20201123A
(DM=433.55 pc cm$^{-3}$). FRB 20200413A was discovered only in the incoherent
beam. FRB 20200915A (also discovered only in the incoherent beam) shows
speckled emission in the dynamic spectrum which cannot be explained by
interstellar scintillation in our Galaxy or plasma lensing, and might be
intrinsic to the source. FRB 20201123A shows a faint post-cursor burst about
200 ms after the main burst and warrants further follow-up to confirm whether
it is a repeating FRB. FRB 20201123A also exhibits significant temporal
broadening consistent with scattering by a turbulent medium. The broadening
exceeds that predicted for medium along the sightline through our Galaxy. We
associate this scattering with the turbulent medium in the environment of the
FRB in the host galaxy. Within the approximately $1'$ localization region of
FRB 20201123A, we identify one luminous galaxy ($r \approx 15.67$;
J173438.35$-$504550.4) that dominates the posterior probability for a host
association. The galaxy's measured properties are consistent with other FRB
hosts with secure associations.

Title:Polarimetric characterization of segmented mirrors,"
Abstract:  We study the impact of the loss of axial symmetry around the optical axis on
the polarimetric properties of a telescope with segmented primary mirror when
each segment is present in a different aging stage. The different oxidation
stage of each segment as they are substituted in time leads to non-negligible
crosstalk terms. This effect is wavelength dependent and it is mainly
determined by the properties of the reflecting material. For an aluminum
coating, the worst polarimetric behavior due to oxidation is found for the blue
part of the visible. Contrarily, dust -- as modeled in this work -- does not
significantly change the polarimetric behavior of the optical system .
Depending on the telescope, there might be segment substitution sequences that
strongly attenuate this instrumental polarization.

Title:Explaining Prolonged Fluctuations in Light Curves of Classical Novae via Modeling,"
Abstract:  Fluctuations during a prolonged maximum have been observed in several nova
eruptions, although it is not clear, and can not be deduced directly from
observations, if the phenomenon is an actual physical reaction to some
mechanism originating in the erupting white dwarf, if it is occurring in the
expanding ejected shell or if it is a form of interaction with the red dwarf
companion. A handful of erupting nova models are investigated in this work, in
order to assess the possibility of this sort of feature being an actual part of
the eruption itself. The results explain that the mechanism that may produce
these fluctuations is the repeated approach and recession of the convective
front from the surface. The efficiency of this mechanism, being dependent on
the mass of the WD envelope and the time scale of the nova cycle, favors low
mass WDs and long accretion phases.

Title:Constraints on PBH as dark matter from observations: a review,"
Abstract:  Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a fascinating candidate for being the dark
matter, albeit one which has been heavily constrained. This review presents an
in depth look at those observational constraints, particularly at their nuances
and uncertainties. Despite their varied origins, the standard PBH formation
path is assumed to be collapse of perturbations after inflation, which should
leave signals visible in the CMB at certain scales. Other constraints come from
microlensing surveys, which severely limit PBHs as dark matter in the solar to
satellite range, but there are diminishing results in regards to lower mass
ranges. Gravitational waves signals and PBH evaporation from Hawking radiation
also make for useful probes, but the former requires the next generation of
experiments before making constraints beyond the solar mass range, and the
later is severely limited above $10^{-16} \rm M_{\odot}$. Other dynamical and
accretion constraints exist for PBH of large masses. Care also has to be given,
as all these constraints can carry different implications coming from
differences between monochromatic and extended mass distributions, and their
degree of clustering. Beyond all these issues, a window still exists for
primordial black holes to be all of the dark matter between $10^{-16}$ and
$10^{-11} \rm M_{\odot}$

Title:Shaping physical properties of galaxy subtypes in the VIPERS survey: environment matters,"
Abstract:  Aims. This study aims to explore the relationship between the physical
properties of different galaxy subclasses and their environment based on the
analysis of 31 631 VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) galaxies
observed at 0.5 < z < 0.9.
Methods. We use the results of an unsupervised clustering algorithm to
distinguish 11 subclasses of VIPERS galaxies based on the multi-dimensional
feature space defined by rest-frame UV to NIR colours presented in Siudek et al
(2018a). We investigate the relationship between the properties of these
subclasses of galaxies and their local environment, defined as the galaxy
density contrast derived from the 5th nearest neighbour technique.
Results. We confirm that the galaxy population-density relation is already in
place at z ~ 0.9, with the blue galaxy fraction decreasing with density,
compensated by an increase of the red fraction. On average red galaxies in the
high-density environment are larger by 28% than the ones in low-density
environments. In particular, we find one group of galaxies, subclass C3, whose
increase of size with time can be explained mainly as the result of mergers;
for other red subclasses, mergers would not seem to play a major role (subclass
C2) or play a negligible role (subclass C1). The properties of the green
galaxies (subclasses C4-6) depend on whether their stellar mass is above or
below a transition mass. Low-mass green galaxies appear to have grown through
secular processes, while in high-mass green galaxies mass assembly appears to
be dominated by mergers. When it comes to blue galaxies, the trend of
decreasing fraction with denser environments seen for the group as a whole
(subclasses C7-11) is found to be driven mostly by one group of galaxies,
subclass C10. These are compact low-mass galaxies with high sSFRs, that are
preferentially found in low-density environments.

Title:Data-driven hadronic interaction model for atmospheric lepton flux calculations,"
Abstract:  The leading contribution to the uncertainties of atmospheric neutrino flux
calculations arise from the cosmic ray nucleon flux and the production cross
sections of secondary particles in hadron-air interactions. The data-driven
model (DDM) developed in this work parametrizes particle yields from
fixed-target accelerator data. The propagation of errors from the accelerator
data to the inclusive muon and neutrino flux predictions results in smaller
uncertainties than in previous estimates, and the description of atmospheric
flux data is good. The model is implemented as part of the MCEq package, and
hence can be flexibly employed for theoretical flux error estimation at
neutrino telescopes.

Title:Constraints on the Galactic Centre environment from Gaia hypervelocity stars II: The evolved population,"
Abstract:  A dynamical encounter between a stellar binary and Sgr A* in the Galactic
Centre (GC) can tidally separate the binary and eject one member with a
velocity beyond the escape speed of the Milky Way. These hypervelocity stars
(HVSs) can offer insight into the stellar populations in the GC environment. In
a previous work, our simulations showed that the lack of main sequence HVS
candidates with precise astrometric uncertainties and radial velocities in
current data releases from the \textit{Gaia} space mission places a robust
upper limit on the ejection rate of HVSs from the GC of $3\times10^{-2} \,
\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. We improve this constraint in this work by additionally
considering the absence of post main sequence HVSs in \textit{Gaia} Early Data
Release 3 as well the existence of the HVS candidate S5-HVS1. This evidence
offers degenerate joint constraints on the HVS ejection rate and the stellar
initial mass function (IMF) in the GC. For a top-heavy GC IMF as suggested by
recent works, our modelling motivates an HVS ejection rate of
$\eta=0.7_{-0.5}^{+1.5} \times10^{-4} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. This preferred
ejection rate can be as large as $10^{-2} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ for a very
top-light IMF and as low as 10$^{-4.5} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ if the IMF is
extremely top-heavy. Constraints will improve further with future \textit{Gaia}
data releases, regardless of how many HVS candidates are found therewithin.

Title:Optical Light Curve of 4FGL J0935.3+0901: A Flaring Black Widow Candidate,"
Abstract:  I obtained time-series photometry of the compact binary candidate for the
Fermi source 4FGL J0935.3+0901. Superposed on the 2.44 hr orbital modulation
are day-to-day variations and frequent flaring as seen in several redback and
black widow millisecond pulsars (MSPs). The short orbital period favors a black
widow. While the modulation of $\leq 1$ mag is smaller than that of most black
widows, it could indicate a low orbital inclination. Although a published
optical spectrum shows strong emission lines, the light curve evinces pulsar
heating of the companion star rather than accretion-disk emission of a
transitional MSP. Emission lines and flaring occur in the same objects,
probably powered by shocks between the relativistic pulsar wind and a wind
driven off the companion star. I also recovered the period in photometry from
the Zwicky Transient Facility. A phase-connected ephemeris derived from MDM
Observatory and ZTF data spanning 4 years yields a period of 0.10153276(36)
days and an epoch for the ascending node of the putative pulsar.

Title:GW170817 4.5 years after merger: Dynamical ejecta afterglow constraints,"
Abstract:  GW170817 is the first binary neutron star (NS) merger detected in
gravitational waves (GWs) and photons, and so far remains the only GW event of
its class with a definitive electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. Radio emission
from the structured jet associated with GW170817 has faded below the
sensitivity achievable via deep radio observations with the most sensitive
radio arrays currently in operation. Hence, we now have the opportunity to
probe the radio re-brightening that some models predict, should emerge at late
times from the interaction of the dynamically-stripped merger ejecta with the
interstellar medium. Here we present the latest results from our deep radio
observations of the GW170817 field with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA), 4.5 years after the merger. Our new data at $3\,$GHz do not show any
compelling evidence for emission in excess to the tail of the jet afterglow
($<3.3\,\mu$Jy), confirming our previous results. We thus set new constraints
on the dynamical ejecta afterglow models. These constraints favor single-speed
ejecta with energy $\lesssim 10^{50}\,$erg (for an ejecta speed of
$\beta_0=0.5$), or steeper energy-speed distributions of the kilonova ejecta.
Our results also suggest larger values of the cold, non-rotating maximum NS
mass in equal mass scenarios. However, without a detection of the dynamical
ejecta afterglow, obtaining precise constraints on the NS equation of state
remains challenging.

Title:Thermal luminosity degeneracy of magnetized neutron stars with and without hyperon cores,"
Abstract:  The dissipation of intense crustal electric currents produces high Joule
heating rates in cooling neutron stars. Here it is shown that Joule heating can
counterbalance fast cooling, making it difficult to infer the presence of
hyperons (which accelerate cooling) from measurements of the observed thermal
luminosity $L_\gamma$. Models with and without hyperon cores match $L_{\gamma}$
of young magnetars (with poloidal-dipolar field $B_{\textrm{dip}} \gtrsim
10^{14}$ G at the polar surface and $L_{\gamma} \gtrsim 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$
at $t \lesssim 10^5$ yr) as well as mature, moderately magnetized stars (with
$B_{\textrm{dip}} \lesssim 10^{14}$ G and $10^{31} \ \textrm{erg s}^{-1}
\lesssim L_{\gamma} \lesssim 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at $t \gtrsim 10^5$ yr). In
magnetars, the crustal temperature is almost independent of hyperon direct Urca
cooling in the core, regardless of whether the latter is suppressed or not by
hyperon superfluidity. The thermal luminosities of light magnetars without
hyperons and heavy magnetars with hyperons have $L_{\gamma}$ in the same range
and are almost indistinguishable. Likewise, $L_{\gamma}$ data of neutron stars
with $B_{\textrm{dip}} \lesssim 10^{14}$ G but with strong internal fields are
not suitable to extract information about the equation of state as long as
hyperons are superfluid, with maximum amplitude of the energy gaps of the order
$\approx 1$ MeV.

Title:Performance forecasts for the primordial gravitational wave detection pipelines for AliCPT-1,"
Abstract:  AliCPT is the first Chinese cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment
which will make the most precise measurements of the CMB polarization in the
northern hemisphere. The key science goal for AliCPT is the detection of
primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). It is well known that an epoch of cosmic
inflation, in the very early universe, can produce PGWs, which leave an imprint
on the CMB in form of odd parity $B$-mode polarization. In this work, we study
the performance of the component separation and parameter estimation pipelines
in context of constraining the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Based on
the simulated data for one observation season, we compare five different
pipelines with different working principles. Three pipelines perform component
separation at map or spectra level before estimating $r$ from the cleaned
spectra, while the other two pipelines performs a global fit for both
foreground parameters and $r$. We also test different methods to account for
the effects of time stream filtering systematics. This work shows that our
pipelines provide consistent and robust constraints on the tensor-to-scalar
ratio and a consistent sensitivity $\sigma(r) \sim 0.02$. This showcases the
potential of precise $B$-mode polarization measurement with AliCPT-1. AliCPT
will provide a powerful opportunity to detect PGWs, which is complementary with
various ground-based CMB experiments in the southern hemisphere.

Title:Influence of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus on the density shape of the Galactic stellar halo revealed by halo K giants from the LAMOST survey,"
Abstract:  We present a study of the influence of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) on
the density shape of the Galactic stellar halo using 11624 K giants from the
LAMOST survey. Every star is assigned a probability of being a member of the
GSE based on its spherical velocities and metallicity by a Gaussian Mixture
Model. We divide the stellar halo into two parts by the obtained probabilities,
of which one is composed of the GSE members and defined as the GSE-related
halo, and the other one is referred to as the GSE-removed halo. Using a
non-parametric method, the radial number density profiles of the two stellar
halos can be well described by a single power law with a variable flattening
$q$ ($r = \sqrt{R^2+[(Z/q(r))]^2}, \nu = {\nu_0}r^{-\alpha}$). The index
$\alpha$ is $4.92\pm0.12$ for the GSE-related halo and $4.25\pm0.14$ for the
GSE-removed halo. Both the two stellar halos are vertically flattened at
smaller radii but become more spherical at larger radii. We find that the
GSE-related halo is less vertically flattened than the GSE-removed halo, and
the difference of $q$ between the two stellar halos ranges from 0.07 to 0.15.
However, after the consideration of the bias, it is thought to be within 0.08
at most of the radii. Finally, we compare our results with two Milky Way
analogues which experience a significant major merger in the TNG50 simulation.
The study of the two analogues also shows that the major merger-related stellar
halo has a smaller ellipticity than the major merger-removed stellar halo.

Abstract:  After the morphological classification of the 18,190 $^{12}$CO molecular
clouds, we further investigate the properties of their internal molecular gas
structures traced by the $^{13}$CO($J=$ 1$-$0) line emissions. Using three
different methods to extract the $^{13}$CO gas structures within each $^{12}$CO
cloud, we find that $\sim$ 15$\%$ of $^{12}$CO clouds (2851) have $^{13}$CO gas
structures and these $^{12}$CO clouds contribute about 93$\%$ of the total
integrated flux of $^{12}$CO emission. In each of 2851 $^{12}$CO clouds with
$^{13}$CO gas structures, the $^{13}$CO emission area generally does not exceed
70$\%$ of the $^{12}$CO emission area, and the $^{13}$CO integrated flux does
not exceed 20$\%$ of the $^{12}$CO integrated flux. We reveal a strong
correlation between the velocity-integrated intensities of $^{12}$CO lines and
those of $^{13}$CO lines in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission regions. This
indicates the H$_{2}$ column densities of molecular clouds are crucial for the
$^{13}$CO lines emission. After linking the $^{13}$CO structure detection rates
of the 18,190 $^{12}$CO molecular clouds to their morphologies, i.e.
nonfilaments and filaments, we find that the $^{13}$CO gas structures are
primarily detected in the $^{12}$CO clouds with filamentary morphologies.
Moreover, these filaments tend to harbor more than one $^{13}$CO structure.
That demonstrates filaments not only have larger spatial scales, but also have
more molecular gas structures traced by $^{13}$CO lines, i.e. the local gas
density enhancements. Our results favor the turbulent compression scenario for
filament formation, in which dynamical compression of turbulent flows induces
the local density enhancements. The nonfilaments tend to be in the low-pressure
and quiescent turbulent environments of the diffuse interstellar medium.

transient in rest-frame UV wavelengths, MUSSES2020J, soon after its occurrence
by using the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) mounted on the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. The
rise time of about 5 days with an extremely high UV peak luminosity shares
similarities to a handful of fast blue optical transients whose peak
luminosities are comparable with the most luminous supernovae while their
timescales are significantly shorter (hereafter ""fast blue ultraluminous
transient,"" FBUT). In addition, MUSSES2020J is located near the center of a
normal low-mass galaxy at a redshift of 1.063, suggesting a possible connection
between the energy source of MUSSES2020J and the central part of the host
galaxy. Possible physical mechanisms powering this extreme transient such as a
wind-driven tidal disruption event and an interaction between supernova and
circumstellar material are qualitatively discussed based on the first multiband
early-phase light curve of FBUTs, although whether the scenarios can
quantitatively explain the early photometric behavior of MUSSES2020J requires
systematical theoretical investigations. Thanks to the ultrahigh luminosity in
UV and blue optical wavelengths of these extreme transients, a promising number
of FBUTs from the local to the high-z universe can be discovered through deep
wide-field optical surveys in the near future.

sample of 88 close major-merger pairs of galaxies (H-KPAIR) based on 2-D
decomposition of SDSS r-band images with \textsc{galfit}. We investigate the
dependence of the interaction-induced specific star formation rate enhancement
($\rm sSFR_{enh}$) on the B/T ratio, and the effects of this dependence on the
differences between star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in spiral+spiral (S+S) and
spiral+elliptical (S+E) pairs. Of all 132 spiral galaxies in H-KPAIR, the 44 in
S+E pairs show higher B/T than those in the 44 S+S pairs, with means of $\rm
B/T = 0.35 \pm 0.05$ and $\rm B/T = 0.26 \pm 0.03$, respectively. There is a
strong negative dependence of $\rm sSFR_{enh}$ on the B/T ratio and only paired
SFGs with $\rm B/T<0.3$ show significant ($>5\sigma$) enhancement. Paired SFGs
in S+S pairs show a similar trend, and many disky SFGs ($\rm B/T<0.1$) in S+S
have strong sSFR enhancements ($\rm sSFR_{enh} > 0.7$~dex). For SFGs in S+E,
the sSFR has no clear B/T dependence, nor any significant enhancement in any
B/T bin. Disky SFGs in S+S show significant ($>4\sigma$) enhancement in the
molecular gas content ($\rm M_{H_2}/M_{star}$), while SFGs in S+E have no such
enhancement in any B/T bin. No significant enhancement on total gas content
($\rm M_{gas}/M_{star}$) is found in any B/T bin for paired galaxies. The star
formation efficiency of either the total gas ($\rm SFE_{gas} = SFR/M_{gas}$) or
the molecular gas ($\rm SFE_{H_2} = SFR/M_{H_2}$) does not depend on the B/T
ratio. The only significant ($>4\sigma$) SFE enhancement found for paired SFGs
is the $\rm SFE_{gas}$ for disky SFGs in S+S pairs.

test particles on disk orbits that span a wide range of initial positions,
energies, and angular momenta. We find that particles that end up in the faint

from a single plane within the progenitor, nearly perpendicular both to the
orbital plane of the progenitor and to the Milky Way stellar disk. Their
original configuration at the start of the simulation corresponds to spiral
features already present 3~Gyr ago, which could be, e.g., the result of a
disk-like component being tidally perturbed, or the tidal tails of a satellite
being disrupted within Sgr. We then run a simulation including the self-gravity
of this disky component. Despite the remaining ambiguity of its origin, this
disk component of the Sgr dwarf with spiral over-densities provides a first
step towards a working model to reproduce the observed faint branch of the
bifurcated Sgr stream.

Title:A new coupled three-form dark energy model and implications for the $H_0$ tension,"
Abstract:  We propose a new coupled three-form dark energy model to relieve the Hubble
tension in this paper. Firstly, by performing a dynamical analysis with the
coupled three-form dark energy model, we obtain four fixed points, including a
saddle point representing a radiation dominated Universe, a saddle point
representing a matter dominated Universe, and two attractors representing two
saturated de Sitter Universes. Secondly, by confronting the coupled three-form
dark energy model and the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model (the $\Lambda$CDM
model) with cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryonic acoustic oscillations
(BAO), Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) observations, we obtain $H_0=
67.8_{-0.6}^{+0.7}$($1\sigma$ level) km/s/Mpc for the coupled three-form dark
energy model and $H_0=67.6_{-0.5}^{+0.5}$($1\sigma$ level) km/s/Mpc for the
$\Lambda$CDM model, the former is in strong tension with the latest local
measured $H_0$ value at $4.3\sigma$ confidence level, while the latter is in
strong tension with the latest local measured $H_0$ value at $5.1\sigma$ level.

Title:CMB constraints on monodromy inflation at strong coupling,"
Abstract:  We carry out a thorough numerical examination of field theory monodromy
inflation at strong coupling. We perform an MCMC analysis using a Gaussian
likelihood, fitting multiparameter models using CMB constraints on the spectral
index and the tensor to scalar ratio. We show that models with uniquely
positive Wilson coefficients are ruled out. If there are coefficients that can
take on both signs, there can be a cancellation of terms that flattens the
potentials and allows one to satisfy current data, and forecasts with strong
constraints on the tensor to scalar ratio. Models of field theory monodromy are
naturally enhanced to include a mechanism for canceling off radiative
corrections to vacuum energy, via vacuum energy sequestering (VES). Although
they include a much larger parameter space, we find that a similar numerical
examination yields no significant change in the Bayesian evidence for VES
enhanced models, with naturalness considerations making them more attractive
from a theoretical perspective.

Title:Deuteration of c-C$_3$H$_2$ towards the pre-stellar core L1544,"
Abstract:  Context: In the centre of pre-stellar cores, the deuterium fractionation is
enhanced due to the cold temperatures and high densities. Therefore, the
chemistry of deuterated molecules can be used to probe the evolution and the
kinematics in the earliest stages of star formation. Aims: We analyse emission
maps of cyclopropenylidene, c-C$_3$H$_2$, to study the distribution of the
deuteration throughout the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. Methods: We use
single-dish observations of c-C$_3$H$_2$, c-H$^{13}$CC$_2$H, c-C$_3$HD, and
c-C$_3$D$_2$ towards the pre-stellar core L1544, performed at the IRAM 30m
telescope. We derive the column density and deuterium fraction maps, and
compare these observations with non-LTE radiative transfer simulations.
Results: The highest deuterium fractions are found close to the dust peak at
the centre of L1544, where the increased abundance of H$_2$D$^+$ ions drives
the deuteration process. The peak values are
N(c-C$_3$HD)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2)=0.17\pm0.01$,
N(c-C$_3$D$_2$)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2)=0.025\pm0.003$ and
N(c-C$_3$D$_2$)/N(c-C$_3$HD$)=0.16\pm0.03$, which is consistent with previous
single point observations. The distributions of c-C$_3$HD and c-C$_3$D$_2$
indicate that the deuterated forms of c-C$_3$H$_2$ in fact trace the dust peak
and not the c-C$_3$H$_2$ peak. Conclusions: The N(c-C$_3$D$_2$)/N(c-C$_3$HD)
map confirms that the process of deuteration is more efficient towards the
centre of the core and demonstrates that carbon-chain molecules are still
present at high densities. This is likely caused by an increased abundance of
He$^+$ ions destroying CO, which increases the amount of carbon atoms in the
gas phase.

"Title:Mountain formation by repeated, inhomogeneous crustal failure in a neutron star","
Abstract:  The elastic crust of a neutron star fractures repeatedly as it spins down
electromagnetically. An idealised, macroscopic model of inhomogeneous crustal
failure is presented based on a cellular automaton with nearest-neighbour
tectonic interactions involving strain redistribution and thermal dissipation.
Predictions are made of the size and waiting-time distributions of failure
events, as well as the rate of failure as the star spins down. The last failure
event typically occurs when the star spins down to approximately 1% of its
birth frequency with implications for rotational glitch activity. Neutron stars
are commonly suggested as sources of continuous gravitational waves. The output
of the automaton is converted into predictions of the star's mass ellipticity
and gravitational wave strain as functions of its age, with implications for
future observations with instruments such as the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), the Virgo interferometer, or the Kamioka
Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA).

Title:Ultra wide black-hole - neutron star binaries as a possible source for gravitational waves and short gamma ray bursts,"
Abstract:  The third observing run of the LIGO/Virgo/KARGA collaboration reported a few
neutron star - black hole (NSBH) merger events. While NSBH mergers have yet to
receive extensive theoretical attention, they may have a promising
electromagnetic signature in the form of short gamma - ray bursts. Here we show
that NSBH dynamical mergers can naturally form from ultra - wide binaries in
the field. Flyby gravitational interactions with other neighbors in the galaxy
in these ultra - wide systems may result in high eccentricity that drives the
binary into a merger. We show that this process can result in a merger rate at
the order of $\sim 10$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$ ($\sim 5$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$) for
elliptical (spiral) galaxies. This channel predicts higher merger rate with
higher velocity dispersion of the host - galaxy, delay time distribution which
shallower than uniform but steeper that $1/t$, higher merger rate for lower BH
to NS mass ratio.

Title:Multi-Scale Image Preprocessing and Feature Tracking for Remote CME Characterization,"
Abstract:  Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) influence the interplanetary environment over
vast distances in the solar system by injecting huge clouds of fast solar
plasma and energetic particles (SEPs). A number of fundamental questions remain
about how SEPs are produced, but current understanding points to CME-driven
shocks and compressions in the solar corona. At the same time, unprecedented
remote and in situ (Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter) solar observations are
becoming available to constrain existing theories. Here we present a general
method for recognition and tracking on solar images of objects such as CME
shock waves and filaments. The calculation scheme is based on a multi-scale
data representation concept a trous wavelet transform, and a set of image
filtering techniques. We showcase its performance on a small set of CME-related
phenomena observed with the SDO/AIA telescope. With the data represented
hierarchically on different decomposition and intensity levels, our method
allows to extract certain objects and their masks from the imaging
observations, in order to track their evolution in time. The method presented
here is general and applicable to detecting and tracking various solar and
heliospheric phenomena in imaging observations. It holds potential to prepare
large training data sets for deep learning. We have implemented this method
into a freely available Python library.

Title:Disks and Outflows in the Intermediate-mass Star Forming Region NGC 2071 IR,"
Abstract:  We present ALMA band 6/7 (1.3 mm/0.87 mm) and VLA Ka band (9 mm) observations
toward NGC 2071 IR, an intermediate-mass star forming region. We characterize
the continuum and associated molecular line emission towards the most luminous
protostars, i.e., IRS1 and IRS3, on ~100 au (0. 2"") scales. IRS1 is partly
resolved in millimeter and centimeter continuum, which shows a potential disk.
IRS3 has a well resolved disk appearance in millimeter continuum and is further
resolved into a close binary system separated by ~40 au at 9 mm. Both sources
exhibit clear velocity gradients across their disk major axes in multiple
spectral lines including C18O, H2CO, SO, SO2, and complex organic molecules
like CH3OH, 13CH3OH and CH3OCHO. We use an analytic method to fit the Keplerian
rotation of the disks, and give constraints on physical parameters with a MCMC
routine. The IRS3 binary system is estimated to have a total mass of
1.4-1.5$M_\odot$. IRS1 has a central mass of 3-5$M_\odot$ based on both
kinematic modeling and its spectral energy distribution, assuming that it is
dominated by a single protostar. For both IRS1 and IRS3, the inferred ejection
directions from different tracers, including radio jet, water maser, molecular
outflow, and H2 emission, are not always consistent, and for IRS1, these can be
misaligned by ~50$^{\circ}$. IRS3 is better explained by a single precessing
jet. A similar mechanism may be present in IRS1 as well but an unresolved
multiple system in IRS1 is also possible.

"Title:Eta Carinae: an evolving view of the central binary, its interacting winds and its foreground ejecta","
Abstract:  FUV spectra of Eta Car, recorded across two decades with HST/STIS, document
multiple changes in resonant lines caused by dissipating extinction in our line
of sight. The FUV flux has increased nearly ten-fold which has led to increased
ionization of the multiple shells within the Homunculus and photo-destruction
of molecular hydrogen. Comparison of observed resonant line profiles with
CMFGEN model profiles allows separation of wind-wind collision and shell
absorptions from the primary wind, P Cygni profiles.The dissipating occulter
preferentially obscured the central binary and interacting winds relative to
the very extended primary wind. We are now able to monitor changes in the
colliding winds with orbital phase. High velocity transient absorptions
occurred across the most recent periastron passage, indicating acceleration of
the primary wind by the secondary wind which leads to a downstream, high
velocity bowshock that is newly generated every orbital period. There is no
evidence of changes in the properties of the binary winds.

Title:Impact of Population III homogeneous stellar evolution on early cosmic reionisation,"
Abstract:  Context: Population III (Pop III) stars may be fast rotating. An expected
consequence of fast rotation is strong internal mixing that deeply affects
their evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and hence their
ionising power. aims: We investigate the impact on the ionising power of Pop
III stars in an extreme case of internal mixing, the one leading to chemically
homogeneous evolution (CHE). In that situation, during the main sequence phase,
the star keeps the same chemical composition from its center to its surface.
Homogeneous stars have larger effective temperatures and luminosities than
stars evolving non-homogeneously and thus are stronger ionising sources.
Methods: The stellar evolution models are based on $n=3$ polytropes with a time
varying hydrogen mass fraction. The ionisation model employs the self-similar
champagne flow solution from Shu et al. (2002), as well as numerical
simulations for the stochastic treatment of star clusters over a grid of
redshifts and halo masses. Results: We find that haloes containing chemically
homogeneous stars have an escape fraction of ionising photons about twice that
of haloes containing classical Pop III stars. By extrapolating the high-$z$
ionisation history powered by Pop III stars (at $z\gtrsim 15$) to the
post-reionisation epoch, we derive the Thomson scattering optical depth $\tau$,
which is compared with the value measured by $\textit{Planck}$. We find that
$\tau$ is overproduced by $\sim1.5- 5\sigma$, when all Pop III stars evolve
homogeneously. This indicates that CHE is unlikely to be realised in the
majority of Pop III stars, although the present study cannot exclude that a
fraction of them undergoes CHE. Conclusions: Fast rotation might have a
significant impact on the ionising budget of Pop III stars, and thus on early
cosmic reionisation.

Title:Ca II Triplet Spectroscopy of Small Magellanic Cloud Red Giants. VI. Analysis of chemical properties of the Main Body,"
Abstract:  We derived radial velocities and CaT metallicity of more than 150 red giants
stars in six SMC star clusters and their surrounding fields, with the
instrument GMOS on GEMINI-S. The mean cluster radial velocity and metallicity
were obtained with mean errors of 2.2 km\,s$^{-1}$ and 0.03 dex, while the mean
field metallicities have a mean error of 0.13 dex. We add this information to
that available for another 51 clusters and 30 fields with CaT metallicities on
the same scale. Using this expanded sample we analize the chemical properties
of the SMC Main Body, defined as the inner 3.4 degrees in semimajor axis. We
found a high probability that the metallicity distribution of the Main Body
clusters is bimodal with a metal-rich and a metal-poor cluster group, having
mean metallicities with a dispersion of $\mu = -0.80$, $\sigma = 0.06$ and $\mu
= -1.15$, $\sigma = 0.10$ dex, respectively. On the other hand, Main Body field
stars show a unimodal metallicity distribution peaking at $[Fe/H] \sim -1$ and
dispersion of $0.3$. Neither metal-rich nor metal-poor clusters present a
metallicity gradient. However the full Main Body cluster sample and field stars
have a negative metallicity gradient consistent with each other, but the one
corresponding to clusters has a large error due to the large metallicity
dispersion present in the clusters studied in that region. Metal-rich clusters
present a clear age-metallicity relation, while metal-poor clusters present no
chemical enrichment throughout the life of the galaxy. We present observational
evidence that the chemical enrichment is complex in the SMC Main Body. Two
cluster groups with potential different origins could be coexisting in the Main
Body. More data with precise and homogeneous metallicities and distances are
needed and dynamical simulations are required to understand possible different
origins for the two possible cluster groups.

Abstract:  We present accurate and deep multi-band ($g,r,i$) photometry of the Local
Group dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822. The images were collected with wide
field cameras at 2m/4m- (INT,CTIO,CFHT) and 8m-class telescopes (SUBARU)
covering a 2 square degrees FoV across the center of the galaxy. We performed
PSF photometry of $\approx$7,000 CCD images and the final catalog includes more
than 1 million objects. We developed a new approach to identify candidate field
and galaxy stars, and performed a new estimate of the galaxy center by using
old stellar tracers finding that it differs by 1.15 (RA) and 1.53 (DEC) arcmin
from previous estimates. We also found that young (Main Sequence, Red
Supergiants), intermediate (Red Clump, Asymptotic Giant Branch [AGB]) and old
(Red Giant Branch [RGB]) stars display different radial distributions. Old
stellar population is spherically distributed and extends to radial distances
larger than previously estimated ($\sim$1 degree). The young population shows a
well defined bar and a disk-like distribution, as suggested by radio
measurements, that is off-center compared with old population. We discuss pros
and cons of the different diagnostics adopted to identify AGB stars and develop
new ones based on optical-NIR-MIR color-color diagrams (CCDs) to characterize
Oxygen and Carbon (C) rich stars. We found a mean population ratio between
Carbon and M-type (C/M) stars of 0.67$\pm$0.08 (optical/NIR/MIR) and we used
the observed C/M ratio with empirical C/M-metallicity relations to estimate a
mean iron abundance of [Fe/H]$\sim$-1.25 ($\sigma$=0.04 dex) that agrees quite
well with literature estimates.

Title:Dust Emission as a Function of Stellar Population Age in the Nearby Galaxy M33,"
Abstract:  Dust emission at 8 micron has been extensively calibrated as an indicator of
current star formation rate for galaxies and ~kpc-size regions within galaxies.
Yet, the exact link between the 8 micron emission and the young stellar
populations in galaxies is still under question, as dust grains can be
stochastically heated also by older field stars. In order to investigate this
link, we have combined mid-infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope
with a published star cluster candidates catalog for the Local Group galaxy
M33. M33 is sufficiently close that the Spitzer's 8 micron images resolve
individual regions of star formation. Star clusters represent almost-single-age
stellar populations, which are significantly easier to model than more complex
mixtures of stars. We find a decrease in the 8 micron luminosity per unit
stellar mass as a function of age of the star clusters, with a large scatter
that is consistent with varying fractions of stellar light absorbed by dust.
The decrease and scatter both confirm findings based on more distant galaxies
and are well described by simple models for the dust emission of a young
stellar population. We conclude that the dust emission at 8 micron depends
sensitively on the age of the stellar population, out to at least the oldest
age analyzed here, ~400 Myr. This dependence complicates the use of the 8
micron emission as a star formation rate indicator, at least for small galactic
regions and individual star forming regions. By leveraging the Spitzer legacy,
this investigation paves the way for future explorations with the James Webb
Space Telescope.

Title:Very massive star winds as sources of the short-lived radioactive isotope $^{26}$Al,"
Abstract:  The $^{26}$Al short-lived radioactive nuclide is the source of the observed
galactic diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission at 1.8 MeV. While different sources of
$^{26}$Al have been explored, such as AGB stars, massive stars winds, and
supernovae, the contribution of very massive stars has never been studied. We
study the stellar wind contribution of very massive stars, i.e stars with
initial masses between 150 and 300 M$_\odot$, to the enrichment in $^{26}$Al of
the galactic interstellar medium. We discuss the production of $^{26}$Al by
studying rotating and non-rotating very massive stellar models with initial
masses between 150 and 300 M$_\odot$ for metallicities Z=0.006, 0.014, and
0.020. We confront this result to a simple Milky Way model taking into account
both the metallicity and the star formation rate gradients. We obtain that very
massive stars in the Z=0.006-0.020 metallicity range might be very significant
contributors to the $^{26}$Al enrichment of the interstellar medium. Typically,
the contribution of the winds of massive stars to the total quantity of
$^{26}$Al in the Galaxy increases by 150\% when very massive stars are
considered. Very massive stars, despite their rarity, might be important
contributors to $^{26}$Al and overall very important actors for nucleosynthesis
in the Galaxy.

Abstract:  In this paper, we carry out a semi-analytic general relativistic study of a
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) jet that is breaking out of a cocoon or stellar
envelope. We solve hydrodynamic equations with the relativistic equation of
state that takes care of fluid composition. In short GRBs, a general
relativistic approach is required to account for curved spacetime in strong
gravity. The piercing of the jet through the cocoon resembles a de Laval nozzle
and the jet may go through recollimation shock transitions. We show that the
possibility of shock transition and the shock properties are sensitive to the
matter composition and the cocoon strength. Obtained Lorentz factors in
thermally driven jets comfortably reach a few $\times$10.

Title:Can Type III Radio Storms be a Source of Seed Particles to Shock Acceleration?,"
Abstract:  An intense type III radio storm has been disrupted by a fast halo coronal
mass ejection (CME) on 2000 April 4. The CME is also associated with a large
solar energetic particle (SEP) event. The storm recovers after about10 hrs. We
identified another CME that occurs on 2003 November 11 with similar CME
properties but there is no type III storm in progress. The 2003 November 11 CME
is also not associated with an SEP event above the background (less than 2
pfu), whereas the one with type III storm has an intense SEP event (about 56
pfu). One of the factors affecting the intensity of SEP events is the presence
of seed particles that are accelerated by CME-driven shocks. We suggest that
the type III storm source, which accelerates electrons to produce the storm,
also accelerates ions that serve as seed particles to the CME shock.

Abstract:  A pseudo-Nambu Goldstone Boson (pNGB) arising from the breaking of a global
symmetry ($G\rightarrow H$) can be one of the most promising candidates for the
quintessence model, to explain the late-time acceleration of our universe.
Motivated from the Composite Higgs scenario, we have investigated the case
where the pNGB associated with $SO(N)/ SO(N-1)$ develops a potential through
its couplings with the particles that do not form the complete representations
of $G$. The Coleman Weinberg (CW) potential is generated via the external
particles in the loop which are linked with the strongly interacting dynamics
and can be computed predicatively. The model of Dark Energy (DE) is tested
against several latest cosmological observations such as supernovae data of
Pantheon, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Redshift-space distortion (RSD)
data, etc. We have found that the fit prefers the sub-Planckian value of the
pNGB field decay constant. Moreover, we have found that the model predicts
cosmological parameters well within the allowed range of the observation and
thus gives a well-motivated model of quintessence.

Title:Upgraded GMRT survey for pulsars in globular clusters. I: Discovery of a millisecond binary pulsar in NGC 6652,"
Abstract:  Globular clusters contain a unique pulsar population, with many exotic
systems that can form only in their dense stellar environments. The leap in
sensitivity of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India,
especially at low radio frequencies ($<$ 1 GHz) has motivated a new search for
radio pulsars in a group of eight Southern globular clusters. We discovered PSR
J1835$-$3259B, a 1.83-ms pulsar in NGC 6652; this is in a near-circular wide
orbit of 28.7 hr with a low-mass ($ \sim 0.2 \, M_{\rm \odot}$) companion,
likely a Helium white dwarf. We derived a 10-year timing solution for this
system. We also present measurements of scattering, flux densities and spectral
indices for some of the previously known pulsars in these GCs. A significant
fraction of the pulsars in these clusters have steep spectral indices.
Additionally, we detected eight radio point sources not associated with any
known pulsar positions in the radio images. There are four newly identified
sources, three in NGC 6652 and one in NGC 6539, and one previously identified
source each in NGC 1851, NGC 6440, NGC 6544, and Terzan 5. Surprisingly, our
images show that our newly discovered pulsar, PSR J1835$-$3259B, is the
brightest pulsar in all GCs we have imaged; like other pulsars with broad
profiles (Terzan 5 C and O), its flux density in the radio images is much
larger than in its pulsations. This indicates that their pulsed emission is
only a fraction of their total emission. The detection of radio sources outside
the core radii but well within the tidal radii of these clusters show that
future GC surveys should complement the search analysis by using the imaging
capability of interferometers, and preferentially synthesize large number of
search beams in order to obtain a larger field of view.

Title:FIREbox: Simulating galaxies at high dynamic range in a cosmological volume,"
Abstract:  We introduce a suite of cosmological volume simulations to study the
evolution of galaxies at high numerical resolution as part of the Feedback in
Realistic Environments project. FIREbox, the principal simulation of the
present suite, provides a representative sample of galaxies (~1000 galaxies
with Mstar > 10^8 Msun at z=0) at a resolution (~ 20 pc, m_b ~ 6x10^4 Msun)
comparable to state-of-the-art galaxy zoom-in simulations. Furthermore, FIREbox
captures the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium in a fully
cosmological setting (L=22.1 Mpc) thanks to its exceptionally high dynamic
range (~10^6) and the inclusion of multi-channel stellar feedback. Here, we
focus on validating the predictions of FIREbox by comparing to observational
data. We find that, at a given stellar mass (for Mstar < 10^{10.5-11} Msun),
simulated galaxies have star formation rates, atomic and molecular gas masses,
gas phase and stellar metallicities in broad agreement with observations. In
addition, FIREbox shows that these galaxy scaling relations extend to the low
mass regime (Mstar ~ 10^7 Msun) and follow a (broken) power-law relationship.
Also reproduced are the evolution of the cosmic HI density and the HI column
density distribution at z~0-5. At low z, FIREbox predicts a peak in the
stellar-mass--halo-mass relation, but also a higher abundance of massive
galaxies and a higher cosmic star formation rate density than observed, showing
that stellar feedback alone is insufficient to reproduce the properties of
massive galaxies at late times. Given its high resolution and sample size,
FIREbox offers a baseline prediction of galaxy formation theory in a
$\Lambda$CDM Universe while also highlighting modeling challenges to be
addressed in next generation galaxy simulations.

perturbation theory models with N-body simulations to reduce the effects of
finite computational volume in the prediction of ensemble average properties in
the simulations within the context of control variates. In particular we use
the fact that Zel'dovich displacements, computed during initial condition
generation for any simulation, correlate strongly with the final density field.
Since all the correlators of biased tracers can be computed with arbitrary
precision for these displacements, pairing the Zel'dovich `simulation' with the
N-body realization allows hundredfold reductions in sample variance for power
spectrum or correlation function estimation. Zel'dovich control variates can
accurately extend matter or tracer field emulators to larger scales than
previously possible, as well as improving measurements of statistics in
simulations which are inherently limited to small volumes, such as
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and reionization.

Title:Impact of the cosmic background radiation on the initial mass function of metal-poor stars,"
Abstract:  We study star cluster formation at low metallicities of
$Z/Z_\odot=10^{-4}$--$10^{-1}$ using three-dimensional hydrodynamics
simulations. Particular emphasis is put on how the stellar mass distribution is
affected by the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), which sets the
temperature floor to the gas. Starting from the collapse of a turbulent cloud,
we follow the formation of a protostellar system resolving $\sim$au scale. In
relatively metal-enriched cases of $Z/Z_\odot \gtrsim 10^{-2}$, where the mass
function resembles the present-day one in the absence of the CMB, high
temperature CMB suppresses cloud fragmentation and reduces the number of
low-mass stars, making the mass function more top-heavy than in the cases
without CMB heating at $z\gtrsim10$. In lower-metallicity cases with $Z/Z_\odot
\lesssim 10^{-3}$, where the gas temperature is higher than the CMB value due
to inefficient cooling, the CMB has only a minor impact on the mass
distribution, which is top-heavy regardless of the redshift. In cases either
with a low metallicity of $Z/Z_\odot \lesssim 10^{-2}$ or at a high redshift
$z\gtrsim10$, the mass spectrum consists of a low-mass Salpeter-like component,
peaking at $0.1~M_\odot$, and a top-heavy component with $10$--$50~M_\odot$,
with the fraction in the latter increasing with increasing redshift. In
galaxies forming at $z\gtrsim10$, the major targets of the future instruments
including JWST, CMB heating makes the stellar mass function significantly
top-heavy, enhancing the number of supernova explosions by a factor of $1.4$
($2.8$) at $z=10$ ($20$, respectively) compared to the prediction by Chabrier
initial mass function when $Z/Z_\odot=0.1$.

Title:The Fornax3D project: The assembly history of massive early-type galaxies in the Fornax cluster from deep imaging and integral field spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  This work is based on high quality integral-field spectroscopic data obtained
with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope
(VLT). The 21 brightest ($m_B\leq 15$ mag) early-type galaxies (ETGs) inside
the virial radius of the Fornax cluster are observed out to distances of
$\sim2-3\ R_{\rm e}$. Deep imaging from the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) is also
available for the sample ETGs. We investigate the variation of the galaxy
structural properties as a function of the total stellar mass and cluster
environment. Moreover, we correlate the size scales of the luminous components
derived from a multi-component decomposition of the VST surface-brightness
radial profiles of the sample ETGs with the MUSE radial profiles of stellar
kinematic and population properties. The results are compared with both
theoretical predictions and previous observational studies and used to address
the assembly history of the massive ETGs of the Fornax cluster. We find that
galaxies in the core and north-south clump of the cluster, which have the
highest accreted mass fraction, show milder metallicity gradients in their
outskirts than the galaxies infalling into the cluster. We also find a
segregation in both age and metallicity between the galaxies belonging to the
core and north-south clump and the infalling galaxies. The new findings fit
well within the general framework for the assembly history of the Fornax
cluster.

Title:Insufficient Gas Accretion Caused the Decline in Cosmic Star-Formation Activity 8 Billion Years Ago,"
Abstract:  Measurements of the atomic hydrogen (HI) properties of high-redshift galaxies
are critical to understanding the decline in the star-formation rate (SFR)
density of the Universe after its peak $\approx8-11$ Gyr ago. Here, we use
$\approx510$ hours of observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope to measure the dependence of the average HI mass of star-forming
galaxies at $z=0.74-1.45$ on their average stellar mass and redshift, by
stacking their HI 21 cm emission signals. We divide our sample of 11,419
main-sequence galaxies at $z=0.74-1.45$ into two stellar-mass ($M_*$)
subsamples, with $M_*>10^{10} M_\odot$ and $M_*<10^{10} M_\odot$, and obtain
clear detections, at $>4.6\sigma$ significance, of the stacked HI 21 cm
emission in both subsamples. We find that galaxies with $M_*>10^{10} M_\odot$,
which dominate the decline in the cosmic SFR density at $z\lesssim1$, have HI
reservoirs that can sustain their SFRs for only a short period, $0.86\pm0.20$
Gyr, unless their HI is replenished via accretion. We also stack the HI 21 cm
emission from galaxies in two redshift subsamples, at $z=0.74-1.25$ and
$z=1.25-1.45$, again obtaining clear detections of the stacked HI 21 cm
emission signals, at $>5.2\sigma$ significance in both subsamples. We find that
the average HI mass of galaxies with $\langle M_* \rangle\approx10^{10}
M_\odot$ declines steeply over a period of $\approx1$ billion years, from
$(33.6\pm6.4) \times 10^9 M_\odot$ at $\langle z\rangle\approx1.3$ to
$(10.6\pm1.9)\times10^9 M_\odot$ at $\langle z\rangle\approx1.0$, i.e. by a
factor $\gtrsim3$. We thus find direct evidence that accretion of HI onto
star-forming galaxies at $z\approx1$ is insufficient to replenish their HI
reservoirs and sustain their SFRs, thus resulting in the decline in the cosmic
SFR density 8 billion years ago.

Title:Realistic synthetic integral field spectroscopy with RealSim-IFS,"
Abstract:  The most direct way to confront observed galaxies with those formed in
numerical simulations is to forward-model simulated galaxies into synthetic
observations. Provided that synthetic galaxy observations include similar
constraints and limitations as real observations, they can be used to (1) carry
out even-handed comparisons of observation and theory and (2) map the
observable characteristics of simulated galaxies to their a priori known
origins. In particular, integral field spectroscopy (IFS) expands the scope of
such comparisons and mappings to an exceptionally broad set of physical
properties. We therefore present RealSim-IFS: a tool for forward-modelling
galaxies from hydrodynamical simulations into synthetic IFS observations. The
core components of RealSim-IFS model the detailed spatial sampling mechanics of
any fibre-bundle, image slicer, or lenslet array IFU and corresponding
observing strategy, real or imagined, and support the corresponding propagation
of noise adopted by the user. The code is highly generalized and can produce
cubes in any light- or mass-weighted quantity (e.g. specific intensity,
gas/stellar line-of-sight velocity, stellar age/metallicity, etc.). We show
that RealSim-IFS exactly reproduces the spatial reconstruction of specific
intensity and variance cubes produced by the MaNGA survey Data Reduction
Pipeline using the calibrated fibre spectra as input. We then apply RealSim-IFS
by producing a public synthetic MaNGA stellar kinematic survey of 893 galaxies
with $\log M_{\star}/M_{\odot}>10$ from the TNG50 cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation.

Title:Radiative turbulent mixing layers at high Mach numbers,"
Abstract:  Radiative turbulent mixing layers (TMLs) are ubiquitous in astrophysical
environments, e.g., the circumgalactic medium (CGM), and are triggered by the
shear velocity at interfaces between different gas phases. To understand the
shear velocity dependence of TMLs, we perform a set of 3D hydrodynamic
simulations with an emphasis on the TML properties at high Mach numbers
$\mathcal{M}$. Since the shear velocity in mixing regions is limited by the
local sound speed of mixed gas, high-Mach number TMLs develop into a two-zone
structure: a Mach number-independent mixing zone traced by significant cooling
and mixing, plus a turbulent zone with large velocity dispersions which expands
with greater $\mathcal{M}$. Low-Mach number TMLs do not have distinguishable
mixing and turbulent zones. The radiative cooling of TMLs at low and high Mach
numbers is predominantly balanced by enthalpy consumption and turbulent
dissipation respectively. Both the TML surface brightness and column densities
of intermediate-temperature ions (e.g., O VI) scale as
$\propto\mathcal{M}^{0.5}$ at $\mathcal{M} \lesssim 1$, but reach saturation
($\propto \mathcal{M}^0$) at $\mathcal{M} \gtrsim 1$. Inflow velocities and hot
gas entrainment into TMLs are substantially suppressed at high Mach numbers,
and strong turbulent dissipation drives the evaporation of cold gas. This is in
contrast to low-Mach number TMLs where the inflow velocities and hot gas
entrainment are enhanced with greater $\mathcal{M}$, and cold gas mass
increases due to the condensation of entrained hot gas.

Title:Primordial black hole mergers from three-body interactions,"
Abstract:  Current gravitational-wave observations set the most stringent bounds on the
abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the solar mass range. This
constraint, however, inherently relies on the merger rate predicted by PBH
models. Previous analyses have focused mainly on two binary formation
mechanisms: early Universe assembly out of decoupling from the Hubble expansion
and dynamical capture in present-day dark matter structures. Using reaction
rates of three-body processes studied in the astrophysical context, we show
that, under conservative assumptions, three-body interactions in PBH halos
efficiently produce binaries and significantly contribute to the overall merger
rate, provided PBHs make up a sufficient fraction of the dark matter. Those
binaries form at high redshift in Poisson-induced PBH small-scale structures
and a fraction is predicted to coalesce and merge within the current age of the
Universe, at odds with the dynamical capture scenario where they merge
promptly. Our results enable LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA constraints on the PBH abundance
to set stronger bounds in this interesting mass range, and have important
implications for clustered PBH scenarios that might evade such constraints.

Title:The thermodynamics of stellar multiplicity: dynamical evolution of binary star populations in dense stellar environments,"
Abstract:  We recently derived, using the density-of-states approximation, analytic
distribution functions for the outcomes of direct single-binary scatterings
(Stone & Leigh 2019). Using these outcome distribution functions, we present in
this paper a self-consistent statistical mechanics-based analytic model
obtained using the Fokker-Planck limit of the Boltzmann equation. Our model
quantifies the dominant gravitational physics, combining both strong and weak
single-binary interactions, that drives the time evolution of binary orbital
parameter distributions in dense stellar environments. We focus in particular
the distributions of binary orbital energies and eccentricities. We find a
novel steady state distribution of binary eccentricities, featuring strong
depletions of both the highest and the lowest eccentricity binaries. In energy
space, we compare the predictions of our analytic model to the results of
numerical N-body simulations, and find that the agreement is good for the
initial conditions considered here. This work is a first step toward the
development of a fully self-consistent semi-analytic model for dynamically
evolving binary star populations in dense stellar environments due to direct
few-body interactions.

Abstract:  Recent CHIME/FRB observations of the periodic repeating FRB 180916B have

the periodicity results from the precession of an accretion disc, in analogy
with those of Her X-1, SS 433, and many other superorbital periods, the width
of the observable phase window indicates that the disc axis jitters by an angle
of about 0.14 of the inclination angle, similar to the ratio of 0.14 in the

Title:The UV luminosity functions of Bright z>8 Galaxies: Determination from ~0.41 deg2 of HST Observations along ~sim 300 independent sightlines,"
Abstract:  We determine the bright end of the rest-frame UV luminosity function at
$z=8-10$ by selecting bright $z\gtrsim 8$ photometric candidates from the
largest systematic compilation of HST (pure-)parallel observations to date, the
Super-Brightest-of-Reionizing-Galaxies (SuperBoRG) data set. The data set
includes $\sim300$ independent sightlines distributed across the sky with WFC3
observations, totalling $800-1300$ arcmin$^2$ (depending on redshift). We
identify 31 $z\gtrsim8$ candidates via colour selection and photo-$z$ analysis
with observed magnitude ($24.1< H_{160} <26.6$). Following detailed
completeness and source recovery simulations in each independent field, as well
as modelling of interloper contamination, we derive rest-frame UV luminosity
functions at $z=8-10$ down to UV magnitude $\simeq-23$. We find that the
bright-end of the galaxy luminosity function can be described both by a
Schechter and by a double power-law function, with our space-based large area
determination showing some tentative discrepancies with the luminosity
functions derived from ground-based observations at the same redshifts.
Interestingly, the UV luminosity function we derived at $z=8$ is consistent
with no evolution of the bright end from $z=6-7$, suggesting a substantial
contribution from AGNs at magnitude $M_{UV}<-22$. On the other hand, our
derived UVLFs at all redshifts are still consistent with a scenario where the
UV light originates from stars, but there is a vanishing dust content at
$z\gtrsim 7.5$. Both scenarios raise interesting prospects to further
understand galaxy formation in extreme objects during the epoch of reionization
thanks to upcoming James Webb Space Telescope spectroscopic observations.

Title:Meteor shower radiant dispersions in Global Meteor Network data,"
Abstract:  Meteor showers occur when streams of meteoroids originating from a common
source intersect the Earth. There will be small dissimilarities between the
direction of motion of different meteoroids within a stream, and these small
differences will act to broaden the radiant, or apparent point of origin, of
the shower. This dispersion in meteor radiant can be particularly important
when considering the effect of the Earth's gravity on the stream, as it limits
the degree of enhancement of the stream's flux due to gravitational focusing.
In this paper, we present measurements of the radiant dispersion of twelve
showers using observations from the Global Meteor Network. We find that the
median offset of individual meteors from the shower radiant ranges from
0.32$^\circ$ for the eta Aquariids to 1.41$^\circ$ for the Southern Taurids. We
also find that there is a small but statistically significant drift in
Sun-centered ecliptic radiant and/or geocentric speed over time for most
showers. Finally, we compare radiant dispersion with shower duration and find
that, in contrast with previous results, the two quantities are not correlated
in our data.

Title:Polarization in early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts driven by precessing jets,"
Abstract:  Jet precessions are widely involved in astrophysical phenomena from galaxies
to X-ray binaries and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Polarization presents a unique
probe of the magnetic fields in GRB jets. The precession of GRBs relativistic
jets will change the geometry within the observable emitting region of the jet,
which can potentially affect the polarization of the afterglow. In this paper,
we take into account jet precession to study the polarization evolution and
corresponding light curves in GRB early optical afterglows with ordered and
random magnetic field geometries. We find that the jet precession in long-lived
engines can significantly reduce the polarization degree (PD) regardless of the
magnetic field structure. The strongest PD attenuation is found when the line
of sight is aligned with the precession axis. Our results show that jet
precession can provide new insight into the low PD measured in the early
optical afterglows of GRBs.

Abstract:  Chemical processes on the surface of icy grains play an important role in the
chemical evolution in molecular clouds. In particular, reactions involving
non-energetic hydrogen atoms accreted from the gaseous phase have been

benzene and naphthalene molecules embedded in amorphous solid water (ASW) in
the present study, which revealed that a portion of these molecules could be
fully hydrogenated in astrophysical environments. The penetration depths of
non-energetic hydrogen atoms into porous and non-porous ASW were determined
using benzene molecules to be >50 and ~10 monolayers, respectively (1 monolayer

module recovers spectral information and restrains the negative influences from
noises based on Cross-band Belief Enhancement. RRNet is trained by the spectra
from common stars between LAMOST DR7 and APOGEE-Payne catalog. The 17 stellar
parameters and their uncertainties for 2.37 million medium-resolution spectra

Title:Impact of gravitational lensing on black hole mass function inference with third-generation gravitational wave detectors,"
Abstract:  The recent rapid growth of the black hole (BH) catalog from gravitational
waves (GWs), has allowed us to study the substructure of black hole mass
function (BHMF) beyond the simplest Power-Law distribution. However, the BH
masses inferred from binary BH merger events, may be systematically
'brightened' or 'dimmed' by the gravitational lensing effect. In this work, we
investigate the impact of gravitational lensing on the BHMF inference
considering the detection of the third-generation GW detector -- the Einstein
Telescope (ET). We focus on high redshift, $z=10$, in order to obtain the upper
limits of this effect. We use Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the data
adopting 3 original BHMFs under Un-Lensed and Lensed scenarios, then recover
the parameters of BHMFs from the mock data, and compare the difference of
results, respectively. We found that all the parameters are well recovered
within one standard deviation(std., 1$\sigma$), and all 3 BHMF models are
reconstructed within 68\% credible interval, suggesting that lensing would not
change the main structure drastically, even at very high redshifts and with
high precision of ET. And the modest influence beyond $50M_{\odot}$, depends on
the modeling of the high mass tail or substructure of BHMF. We conclude that
the impact of lensing on BHMF inference with ET can be safely ignored in the
foreseeable future. Careful handling of lensing effects is required only when
focusing on an accurate estimation of the high mass end of BHMF at high
redshifts.

constraints are consistent with those from Mg II QSOs, allowing us to derive

Title:Host galaxy magnitude of OJ 287 from its colours at minimum light,"
Abstract:  OJ 287 is a BL Lacertae type quasar in which the active galactic nucleus
(AGN) outshines the host galaxy by an order of magnitude. The only exception to
this may be at minimum light when the AGN activity is so low that the host
galaxy may make quite a considerable contribution to the photometric intensity
of the source. Such a dip or a fade in the intensity of OJ 287 occurred in
November 2017, when its brightness was about 1.75 magnitudes lower than the
recent mean level. We compare the observations of this fade with similar fades
in OJ 287 observed earlier in 1989, 1999, and 2010. It appears that there is a
relatively strong reddening of the B$-$V colours of OJ 287 when its V-band
brightness drops below magnitude 17. Similar changes are also seen V$-$R,
V$-$I, and R$-$I colours during these deep fades. These data support the
conclusion that the total magnitude of the host galaxy is $V=18.0 \pm 0.3$,
corresponding to $M_{K}=-26.5 \pm 0.3$ in the K-band. This is in agreement with
the results, obtained using the integrated surface brightness method, from
recent surface photometry of the host. These results should encourage us to use
the colour separation method also in other host galaxies with strongly variable
AGN nuclei. In the case of OJ 287, both the host galaxy and its central black
hole are among the biggest known, and its position in the black hole
mass-galaxy mass diagram lies close to the mean correlation.

Abstract:  Early-time radiative signals from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can provide
important constraints on the explosion mechanism and the progenitor system. We

optical, ultraviolet, and near-infrared bands, covering the phases from
$\sim-$16.7 days to $\sim$+367.8 days relative to its $B-$band peak luminosity.
The photometric and spectral evolutions of SN 2019np resembles the average
behavior of normal SNe Ia. The absolute B-band peak magnitude and the post-peak
decline rate are $M_{\rm max}(B)=-19.52 \pm 0.47$mag and $\Delta m_{\rm15}(B)
=1.04 \pm 0.04$mag, respectively. No Hydrogen line has been detected in the
near-infrared and nebular-phase spectra of SN 2019np. Assuming that the
$^{56}$Ni powering the light curve is centrally located, we find that the
bolometric light curve of SN 2019np shows a flux excess up to 5.0% in the early
phase compared to the radiative diffusion model. Such an extra radiation
perhaps suggests the presence of an additional energy source beyond the
radioactive decay of central nickel. Comparing the observed color evolution
with that predicted by different models such as interactions of SN ejecta with
circumstellar matter (CSM)/companion star, a double-detonation explosion from a
sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD), and surface $^{56}$Ni mixing, the
latter one is favored.

these large-scale expansion patterns: feedback-driven expansion from a previous
generation of massive stars, and expansion as a result of the turbulent
velocity field in the primordial molecular cloud. While it is tempting to
attribute such large-scale expansion patterns to feedback processes, we find
that the observed kinematics are fully consistent with the turbulent origin,
and therefore that the injection of further energy or momentum from feedback is
not required. Similar conclusions may be drawn for other star forming regions
with large-scale expansion patterns.

Title:Diagnosing large-scale stellar magnetic fields using PCA on spectropolarimetric data,"
Abstract:  Insights on stellar surface large-scale magnetic field topologies are usually
drawn by applying Zeeman-Doppler-Imaging (ZDI) to the observed
spectropolarimetric time series. However, ZDI requires experience for reliable
results to be reached and is based on a number of prior assumptions that may
not be valid, e.g., when the magnetic topology is evolving on timescales
comparable to or shorter than the time span over which observations are
collected. In this paper, we present a method based on Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) applied to circularly polarised (Stokes~$V$) line profiles of
magnetic stars to retrieve the main characteristics of the parent large-scale
magnetic topologies, like for instance, the relative strength of the poloidal
and toroidal components, and the degree of axisymmetry of the dominant field
component and its complexity (dipolar or more complex). We show that this
method can also be used to diagnose the temporal variability of the large-scale
magnetic field. Performing best for stars with moderate projected equatorial
velocities hosting relatively simple magnetic field topologies, this new method
is simpler than ZDI, making it convenient to rapidly diagnose the main
characteristics of the large-scale fields of non-degenerate stars and to
provide insights into the temporal evolution of the field topology.

Title:Unexpected solar-cycle variation of acoustic mode power in Sun-as-a-star observations,"
Abstract:  We examine the solar-cycle variation of the power in the low-degree
helioseismic modes by looking at binned power spectra from 45 years of
observations with the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network, which provides a
more robust estimate of the mode power than that obtained by peak fitting. The
solar-cycle variation of acoustic mode power in the five-minute band is clearly
seen. Unusually, even though Cycle 24 was substantially weaker in terms of
surface magnetic activity than Cycle 23, the reduction in mode power at solar
maximum is very similar for the two cycles, suggesting that the relationship
between mode power and magnetic activity is more complex than has previously
been thought. This is in contrast to the mode frequencies, which show a strong
correlation with activity with only subtle differences between in the response
across different solar cycles.

Title:TIC: A Stokes inversion code for scattering polarization with partial frequency redistribution and arbitrary magnetic fields,"
Abstract:  We present the Tenerife Inversion Code (TIC), which has been developed to
infer the magnetic and plasma properties of the solar chromosphere and
transition region via full-Stokes inversion of polarized spectral lines. The
code is based on the HanleRT forward engine, which takes into account many of
the physical mechanisms that are critical for a proper modeling of the Stokes
profiles of spectral lines originating in the tenuous and highly dynamic
plasmas of the chromosphere and transition region: quantum level population
imbalance and interference (atomic polarization), frequency coherence effects
in polarized resonance scattering (partial frequency redistribution), and the
impact of arbitrary magnetic fields on the atomic polarization and the
radiation field. We present first results of atmospheric and magnetic
inversions, and discuss future developments for the project.

Title:Intrinsic shapes of Brightest Cluster Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We discuss the statistical distribution of galaxy shapes and viewing angles
under the assumption of triaxiality by deprojecting observed Surface Brightness
(SB) profiles of 56 Brightest Cluster Galaxies coming from a recently published
large deep-photometry sample. For the first time, we address this issue by
directly measuring axis ratio profiles without limiting ourselves to a
statistical analysis of average ellipticities. We show that these objects are
strongly triaxial, with triaxiality parameters 0.39 $ \leq T \leq $ 0.72, have
on average axis ratios $< p(r) > = $ 0.84 and $< q(r) > =$ 0.68, and are more
spherical in the central regions but flatten out at large radii. Measured
shapes in the outskirts agree well with the shapes found for simulated massive
galaxies and their dark matter halos from both the IllustrisTNG and the
Magneticum simulations, possibly probing the nature of dark matter. In
contrast, both simulations fail to reproduce the observed inner regions of
BCGs, producing too flattened objects.

Title:A multiwavelength study of the W33 Main ultracompact HII region,"
Abstract:  The dynamics of ionized gas around the W33 Main ultracompact HII region is
studied using observations of hydrogen radio recombination lines and a detailed
multiwavelength characterization of the massive star-forming region W33 Main is
performed. We used the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to observe the
H167$\alpha$ recombination line at 1.4 GHz at an angular resolution of 10
arcsec, and Karl. G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) data acquired in the GLOSTAR
survey to study the dynamics of ionized gas. We also observed the radio
continuum at 1.4 GHz and 610 MHz with the GMRT and used GLOSTAR 4$-$8 GHz
continuum data to characterize the nature of the radio emission. In addition,
archival data from submillimeter to near-infrared wavelengths were used to
study the dust emission and identify YSOs in the W33 Main star-forming region.
The radio recombination lines were detected at good signal to noise in the
GLOSTAR data, while the H167$\alpha$ radio recombination line was marginally
detected with the GMRT. The spectral index of radio emission in the region
determined from GMRT and GLOSTAR shows the emission to be thermal in the entire
region. Along with W33 Main, an arc-shaped diffuse continuum source,
G12.81$-$0.22, was detected with the GMRT data. The GLOSTAR recombination line
data reveal a velocity gradient across W33 Main and G12.81$-$0.22. The electron
temperature is found to be 6343 K and 4843 K in W33 Main and G12.81$-$0.22,
respectively. The physical properties of the W33 Main molecular clump were
derived by modeling the dust emission using data from the ATLASGAL and Hi-GAL
surveys and they are consistent with the region being a relatively evolved site
of massive star formation. The gas dynamics and physical properties of
G12.81$-$0.22 are consistent with the HII region being in an evolved phase and
its expansion on account of the pressure difference is slowing down.

Title:On the self-consistent time-dependent linearized response of stellar discs to external perturbations,"
Abstract:  We study the explicitly time-dependent response of a razor-thin axisymmetric
disc to externally imposed perturbations by recasting the linearized
Collisionless Boltzmann equation as an integral equation and applying Kalnajs'
matrix method. As an application we consider the idealized problem of
calculating the dynamical friction torque on a steadily rotating,
two-dimensional bar. We consider two choices of basis functions in the matrix
method, showing that both lead to comparable results. The torques from our
linearised calculation are in excellent agreement with those measured from
$N$-body simulation, as long as the bar perturbation does not resonate with a
significant fraction of the disc's stars.

Title:CONNECT: A neural network based framework for emulating cosmological observables and cosmological parameter inference,"
Abstract:  Bayesian parameter inference is an essential tool in modern cosmology, and
typically requires the calculation of $10^5$--$10^6$ theoretical models for
each inference of model parameters for a given dataset combination. Computing
these models by solving the linearised Einstein-Boltzmann system usually takes
tens of CPU core-seconds per model, making the entire process very
computationally expensive.
In this paper we present \textsc{connect}, a neural network framework
emulating \textsc{class} computations as an easy-to-use plug-in for the popular
sampler \textsc{MontePython}. \textsc{connect} uses an iteratively trained
neural network which emulates the observables usually computed by
\textsc{class}. The training data is generated using \textsc{class}, but using
a novel algorithm for generating favourable points in parameter space for
training data, the required number of \textsc{class}-evaluations can be reduced
by two orders of magnitude compared to a traditional inference run. Once
\textsc{connect} has been trained for a given model, no additional training is
required for different dataset combinations, making \textsc{connect} many
orders of magnitude faster than \textsc{class} (and making the inference
process entirely dominated by the speed of the likelihood calculation).
For the models investigated in this paper we find that cosmological parameter
inference run with \textsc{connect} produces posteriors which differ from the
posteriors derived using \textsc{class} by typically less than $0.01$--$0.1$
standard deviations for all parameters. We also stress that the training data
can be produced in parallel, making efficient use of all available compute
resources. The \textsc{connect} code is publicly available for download at
\url{this https URL}.

Title:Dynamics or Geysers and tracer transport over the south pole of Enceladus,"
Abstract:  Over the south pole of Enceladus, an icy moon of Saturn, geysers eject water
into space in a striped pattern, making Enceladus one of the most attractive
destinations in the search for extraterrestrial life. We explore the ocean
dynamics and tracer/heat transport associated with geysers as a function of the
assumed salinity of the ocean and various core-shell heat partitions and bottom
heating patterns. We find that, even if heating is concentrated into a narrow
band on the seafloor directly beneath the south pole, the warm fluid becomes
quickly mixed with its surroundings due to baroclinic instability. The warming
signal beneath the ice is diffuse and insufficient to prevent the geyser from
freezing over. Instead, if heating is assumed to be local to the geyser,
emanating from tidal dissipation in the ice itself, the geyser can be
sustained. In this case, the upper ocean beneath the ice becomes stably
stratified and thus a barrier to vertical communication, leading to transit
timescales from the core to the ice shell of hundreds of years.

Title:Discovery of an asteroid family linked to (22) Kalliope and its moon Linus,"
Abstract:  According to adaptive-optics observations by Ferrais et al., (22) Kalliope is
a 150-km, dense and differentiated body. Here, we interpret (22) Kalliope in
the context of bodies in its surroundings. While there is a known moon Linus,
with a 5:1 size ratio, no family has been reported in the literature, which is
in contradiction with the existence of the moon. Using the hierarchical
clustering method (HCM) along with physical data, we identified the Kalliope
family. Previously, it was associated to (7481) San Marcello. We then used
various models (N-body, Monte-Carlo, SPH) of its orbital and collisional
evolution, including the break-up of the parent body, to estimate the dynamical
age of the family and address its link to Linus. The best-fit age is (900+-100)
My according to our collisional model, in agreement with the position of (22)
Kalliope, which was modified by chaotic diffusion due to 4-1-1 three-body
resonance with Jupiter and Saturn. It seems possible to create Linus and the
Kalliope family at the same time, although our SPH simulations show a variety
of outcomes, for both satellite size and the family size-frequency
distribution. The shape of (22) Kalliope itself was most likely affected by
gravitational reaccumulation of `streams', which creates characteristic hills
observed on the surface. If the body was differentiated, its internal structure
is surely asymmetric.

Title:Analytical model for collision probability assessments with large satellite constellations,"
Abstract:  This paper presents an analytical model for collision probability assessments
between de-orbiting or injecting space objects and satellite constellations.
Considering the first to be subjected to a continuous tangential acceleration,
its spiraling motion would result in a series of close approaches in the
proximity of a constellation. The proposed methodology involves the integration
of the collision probability density function on the encounter plane, from
which two analytical formulas, one for the number of close approaches and one
for their respective average collision probability, are obtained. The
mathematical description of the crossing dynamics relies on the assumption of
circular orbits and independent collision probabilities, but does not require
to propagate the satellites' orbit. A comparison with a conventional
propagation method has been performed for validation purposes, proving its
accuracy also in case of elliptical crossing orbits. The model developed has
been used to assess the risk connected to constellation's satellites
replacement, once they have reached their programmed End-of-Life. The
environmental impact of the full replacement of 12 approved constellations is
analysed by means of average collision probability. In particular, it is shown
that the key features for space exploitation sustainability are the maximum
propulsion available from the thruster, the selection of an optimal crossing
orbit and the true anomaly phases between constellations' and crossing
satellites. The consequences of an in-orbit collision are also investigated by
assessing the collision risk generated by the formation of a debris cloud. The
results corroborate the need for international standards for space traffic
management as an exponentially increasing satellites population could trigger a
chain reaction of collisions, making LEO inaccessible for decades.

Title:Maximum likelihood kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich velocity reconstruction,"
Abstract:  The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, cosmic microwave background
(CMB) temperature anisotropies induced by the scattering of CMB photons from
free electrons, will be measured by near-term CMB experiments at high
significance. By combining CMB temperature anisotropies with a tracer of
structure, such as a galaxy redshift survey, previous literature introduced a
number of techniques to reconstruct the radial velocity field. This
reconstructed radial velocity field encapsulates the majority of the
cosmological information contained in the kSZ temperature anisotropies, and can
provide powerful new tests of the standard cosmological model and theories
beyond it. In this paper, we introduce a new estimator for the radial velocity
field based on a coarse-grained maximum likelihood fit for the kSZ component of
the temperature anisotropies, given a tracer of the optical depth. We
demonstrate that this maximum likelihood estimator yields a higher fidelity
reconstruction than existing quadratic estimators in the low-noise and
high-resolution regime targeted by upcoming CMB experiments. We describe
implementations of the maximum likelihood estimator in both harmonic space and
map space, using either direct measurements of the optical depth field or a
galaxy survey as a tracer. We comment briefly on the impact of biases
introduced by imperfect reconstruction of the optical depth field.

Title:Galactic chemical evolution of exoplanet host stars: Are high-mass planetary systems young?,"
Abstract:  The imprints of stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution of the galaxy
can be seen in different stellar populations, with older generation stars
showing higher $\alpha$-element abundances while the later generations becoming
enriched with iron-peak elements. The evolutionary connections and chemical
characteristics of circumstellar disks, stars, and their planetary companions
can be inferred by studying the interdependence of planetary and host star
properties. Numerous studies in the past have confirmed that high-mass giant
planets are commonly found around metal-rich stars, while the stellar hosts of
low-mass planets have a wide range of metallicity. In this work, we analyzed
the detailed chemical abundances for a sample of $>900$ exoplanet hosting stars
drawn from different radial velocity and transit surveys. We correlate the
stellar abundance trends for $\alpha$ and iron-peak elements with the planets'
mass. We find the planet mass-abundance correlation to be primarily negative
for $\alpha$-elements and marginally positive or zero for the iron-peak
elements, indicating that stars hosting giant planets are relatively younger.
This is further validated by the age of the host stars obtained from isochrone
fitting. The later enrichment of protoplanetary material with iron and
iron-peak elements is also consistent with the formation of the giant planets
via the core accretion process. A higher metal fraction in the protoplanetary
disk is conducive to rapid core growth, thus providing a plausible route for
the formation of giant planets. This study, therefore, indicates the observed
trends in stellar abundances and planet mass are most likely a natural
consequence of Galactic chemical evolution.

Abstract:  Exoplanetary properties depend on stellar properties: to know the planet with
accuracy and precision it is necessary to know the star as accurately and
precisely as possible. Our immediate aim is to characterize in a homogeneous
and accurate way a sample of 27 transiting planet-hosting stars observed within
the GAPS program. We determined stellar parameters (effective temperature,
surface gravity, rotational velocity) and abundances of 26 elements
(Li,C,N,O,Na,Mg,Al,Si,S,Ca,Sc,Ti,V,Cr,Fe,Mn,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn,Y,Zr,Ba,La,Nd,Eu). Our
study is based on high-resolution HARPS-N@TNG and FEROS@ESO spectra and uniform
techniques. We derived kinematic properties from Gaia data and estimated for
the first time in exoplanet host stars ages using elemental ratios as chemical
clocks. Teff of our stars is of 4400-6700 K, while [Fe/H] is within -0.3 and
0.4 dex. Lithium is present in 7 stars. [X/H] and [X/Fe] abundances vs [Fe/H]
are consistent with the Galactic Chemical Evolution. The dependence of [X/Fe]
with the condensation temperature is critically analyzed with respect to
stellar and kinematic properties. All targets with measured C and O abundances
show C/O<0.8, compatible with Si present in rock-forming minerals. Most of
targets show 1.0<Mg/Si<1.5, compatible with Mg distributed between olivine and
pyroxene. HAT-P-26, the target hosting the lowest-mass planet, shows the
highest Mg/Si ratio. From our chemo-dinamical analysis we find agreement
between ages and position within the Galactic disk. We note a tendency for
higher density planets to be around metal-rich stars and hints of higher
stellar abundances of some volatiles for lower mass planets. We cannot exclude
that part of our results could be also related to the location of the stars
within the Galactic disk. We trace the planetary migration scenario from the
composition of the planets related to the chemical composition of the hosting
stars

Title:Mass evaluation for red giant stars based on the spectroscopically determined atmospheric parameters,"
Abstract:  The mass (M) of a star can be evaluated from its spectroscopically determined
effective temperature (T _eff) and metallicity ([Fe/H]) along with the
luminosity (L; derived from parallax), while comparing them with grids of
theoretical evolutionary tracks. It has been argued, however, that such a
track-based mass (M_trk) may tend to be overestimated for the case of red
giants. Meanwhile, there is an alternative approach of evaluating mass (M_gLT)
directly from surface gravity (g), L, and T_eff. The practical reliability of
M_gLT was examined for ~100 benchmark giants in the Kepler field, for which
atmospheric parameters are already determined and the reliable mass (M_seis)
along with the evolutionary status are known from asteroseismology. In
addition, similar check was also made for the accuracy of M_trk for comparison.
It turned out that, while a reasonable correlation is seen between M_gLT and
M_seis almost irrespective of the stellar property, its precision is rather
insufficient because log(M_gLT/M_seis) distributes rather widely within
~+/-0.2--0.3dex. In contrast, the reliability of M_trk was found to depend on
the evolutionary status. Although M_trk and M_seis are satisfactorily
consistent with each other (typical dispersion of log(M_trk}/M_seis) is within
~+/-0.1dex) for H-burning red giants as well as He-burning 2nd clump giants of
higher mass, M_trk tends to be considerably overestimated as compared to M_seis
by up to ~<0.4~dex for He-burning 1st clump giants of lower mass. Accordingly,
M_gLT and M_trk are complementary with each other in terms of their
characteristic merit and demerit.

Abstract:  Photospheric abundances of C, N, O, and Na were determined by applying the
synthetic spectrum-fitting technique to 34 snap-shot high-dispersion spectra of
22 RR Lyr stars covering a metallicity range of -1.8 <[Fe/H] < 0.0, with an aim
of investigating the mixing mechanism in the interior of low-mass giant stars
by examining the abundance anomalies of these elements possibly affected by the
evolution-induced dredge-up of nuclear burning products. Special attention was
paid to check the recent theoretical stellar evolution simulations indicating
the importance of thermohaline mixing in low-mass stars (M <~1 M_sun), which is
expected to be more significant as the metallicity is lowered. By inspecting
the resulting abundances in comparison with those of unevolved metal-poor
dwarfs at the same metallicity, the deficiency in C as well as enrichment in N
was confirmed (while O is almost unchanged), the extent of peculiarities
tending to increase with a decrease in [Fe/H]. Accordingly, the [C/N] ratio
turned out to progressively decrease towards lower metallicity from ~0
(Fe/H]~0) to ~-1 ([Fe/H]~-1.5), which is reasonably consistent with the
theoretical prediction in the presence of thermohaline mixing. However, these
RR Lyr stars do not show any apparent Na anomaly (i.e., essentially the same
[Na/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends as those of dwarfs), despite that
metallicity-dependent overabundance in Na is theoretically expected for the
case of non-canonical mixing. This inconsistency between C/N and Na may suggest
a necessity of further improvement in the current theory.

Abstract:  Ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos ($>10^{16}$ eV) can be measured
cost-effectively using in-ice radio detection, which has been explored
successfully in pilot arrays. A large radio detector is currently being
constructed in Greenland with the potential to measure the first UHE neutrino,
and an order-of-magnitude more sensitive detector is being planned with
IceCube-Gen2. For such shallow radio detector stations, we present an
end-to-end reconstruction of the neutrino energy and direction using deep
neural networks (DNNs) developed and tested on simulated data. The DNN
determines the energy with a standard deviation of a factor of two around the
true energy ($\sigma \approx$ 0.3 in $\log_{10}(E)$), which meets the science
requirements of UHE neutrino detectors. For the first time, we are able to
predict the neutrino direction precisely for all event topologies including the
complicated electron neutrino charged-current ($\nu_e$-CC) interactions. The
obtained angular resolution shows a narrow peak at $\mathcal{O}$($1^\circ)$
with extended tails that push the 68\% quantile for non-$\nu_e$-CC (resp.
$\nu_e$-CC interactions) to $4^\circ (5^\circ)$. This highlights the advantages
of DNNs for modeling the complex correlations in radio detector data, thereby
enabling measurement of neutrino energy and direction.

Astrophysics ({\tt MESA}), is used to construct models of stars from pre-main
sequence upto core collapse which serve as the possible progenitors of these

LTD064402+245919 is more likely to be a subgiant with a red star. Using both
Wilson-Devinney code and Phoebe, the derived $T_{eff}$ of secondary is about
3400 K, corresponding to a red M2/3 star. Additionally, the 20% error of
parallax from Gaia is large. The mass of subgiant will be 1.28 $M_{\odot}$
instead of 2.77 $M_{\odot}$, if the refined distance of 5.0kpc is used.
Nevertheless, new multi-colour photometry are warranted for the final

Title:Parallel plasma loops and the energization of the solar corona,"
Abstract:  The outer atmosphere of the Sun is composed of plasma heated to temperatures
well in excess of the visible surface. We investigate short cool and warm (<1
MK) loops seen in the core of an active region to address the role of
field-line braiding in energising these structures. We report observations from
the High-resolution Coronal imager (Hi-C) that have been acquired in a
coordinated campaign with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). In
the core of the active region, the 172 A band of Hi-C and the 1400 A channel of
IRIS show plasma loops at different temperatures that run in parallel. There is
a small but detectable spatial offset of less than 1 arcsec between the loops
seen in the two bands. Most importantly, we do not see observational signatures
that these loops might be twisted around each other. Considering the scenario
of magnetic braiding, our observations of parallel loops imply that the
stresses put into the magnetic field have to relax while the braiding is
applied: the magnetic field never reaches a highly braided state on these
length-scales comparable to the separation of the loops. This supports recent
numerical 3D models of loop braiding in which the effective dissipation is

Title:Analytic Modelling of Binary-Single Encounters: Non-Thermal Eccentricity Distribution and Gravitational-Wave Source Formation,"
Abstract:  Chaotic three-body interactions may lead to the formation of
gravitational-wave sources. Here, by modelling the encounter as a series of
close, non-hierarchical, triple approaches, interspersed with hierarchical
phases, in which the system consists of an inner binary and a star that orbits
it, we compute the pericentre probability distribution, and thereby the
in-spiral probability in any given binary-single encounter. We then consider
the indirect influence of binary-single encounters on the population of
gravitational-wave sources, by changing the eccentricity distribution of hard
binaries in clusters; we calculate this distribution analytically, by requiring
that it be invariant under interactions with single stars.

Title:Investigating the correlations between IceCube high-energy neutrinos and Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations,"
Abstract:  We use 10 years of publicly available IceCube data to investigate the
correlations between high-energy neutrinos and various Fermi-LAT gamma-ray
samples. This work considers the following gamma-ray samples: the third
Fermi-LAT catalog of high-energy sources(3FHL), >100GeV Fermi-LAT events, LAT
12-year source catalog(4FGL), the fourth catalog of active galactic
nuclei(4LAC) and subsets of these samples. For each sample, both a
single-source analysis and a stacking analysis are performed. We find no
indication that the sources in these samples produce significant high-energy
neutrinos. From the null search results, we infer that each source population
can produce no more than ~2.5%-36%(at the 95% confidence level, for a spectral
index of -2.5) of the IceCube's diffuse neutrino flux. Since we are using a
larger (10years) dataset of IceCube neutrinos the constraints are improved by a
factor of ~2 compared to those based on 3 years of data.

Title:Non-Gaussianity constraints from Planck spectral distortion cross-correlations,"
Abstract:  Primordial non-Gaussianity can source $\mu$-distortion anisotropies that are
correlated with the large-scale temperature and polarization signals of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB). A measurement of $\mu T$ and $\mu E$
correlations can therefore be used to constrain it on wavelengths of
perturbations not directly probed by the standard CMB anisotropies. In this
work, we carry out a first rigorous search for $\mu$-type spectral distortion
anisotropies with \Planck data, applying the well-tested constrained ILC
component-separation method combined with the needlet framework. We reconstruct
a $\mu$ map from \Planck data, which we then correlate with the CMB
anisotropies to derive constraints on the amplitude $\fNL$ of the local form
bispectrum, specifically on the highly squeezed configurations with effective
wavenumbers $k_s \simeq \SI{740}{Mpc^{-1}}$ and $k_L \simeq
\SI{0.05}{Mpc^{-1}}$. We improve previously estimated constraints by more than
an order of magnitude. This enhancement is owing to the fact that for the first
time we are able to use the full multipole information by carefully controlling
biases and systematic effects in the final analysis. We also for the first time
incorporate constraints from measurements of $\mu E$ correlations, which
further tighten the limits. A combination of the derived \Planck $\mu T$ and
$\mu E$ power spectra yields $|\fNL| \lesssim 6800$ (95\% c.l.) on this highly
squeezed bispectrum. This is only $\simeq 3$ times weaker than the anticipated
constraint from \LiteBIRD alone. We show that a combination of \LiteBIRD with
\Planck will improve the expected future constraint by $\simeq 20\%$ over
\LiteBIRD alone. These limits can be used to constrain multi-field inflation
models and primordial black hole formation scenarios, thus providing a
promising novel avenue forward in CMB cosmology.

Title:Smart: A program to automatically compute accelerations and variational equations,"
Abstract:  Modern astronomical potentials modeling galaxies or stellar systems can be
rather involved, and deriving their first derivatives (accelerations) and
second derivatives (variational equations) in order to compute orbits and their
chaoticity may be a formidable task. We present here a fully automated routine,
dubbed Smart, with which the accelerations and the variational equations of an
arbitrary potential that has been written in the Fortran 77 language can be
computed. Almost any Fortran 77 statement is admitted in the potential, and the
output are standard Fortran 77 routines ready to use. We validate our algorithm
with a set of potentials including time-dependent, velocity-dependent and very
complex potentials that even involve auxiliary routines. We also describe with
some detail a realistic seven-component Galactic potential, MilkyWayHydra,
which yields very involved derivatives, thus being a good test bed for Smart.

Title:Near-future discovery of point sources of ultra-high-energy neutrinos,"
Abstract:  Upcoming neutrino telescopes may discover ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic
neutrinos, with energies beyond 100 PeV, in the next 10--20 years. Finding
their sources would expose the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays. We search
for sources by looking for multiplets of UHE neutrinos arriving from similar
directions. Our forecasts are state-of-the-art, geared at neutrino
radio-detection in IceCube-Gen2. They account for detector energy and angular
response, and for critical, but uncertain backgrounds. We report powerful
insight. Sources at declination of $-45^\circ$ to $0^\circ$ will be easiest to
discover. Discovering even one steady-state source in 10~years would disfavor
most known steady-state source classes as dominant. Discovering no transient
source would disfavor most known transient source classes as dominant. Our
results aim to inform the design of upcoming detectors.

Title:A deep learning approach to halo merger tree construction,"
Abstract:  A key ingredient for semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation is the
mass assembly history of haloes, encoded in a tree structure. The most commonly
used method to construct halo merger histories is based on the outcomes of
high-resolution, computationally intensive N-body simulations. We show that
machine learning (ML) techniques, in particular Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs), are a promising new tool to tackle this problem with a modest
computational cost and retaining the best features of merger trees from
simulations. We train our GAN model with a limited sample of merger trees from
the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE)
simulation suite, constructed using two halo finders-tree builder algorithms:
SUBFIND-D-TREES and ROCKSTAR-ConsistentTrees. Our GAN model successfully learns
to generate well-constructed merger tree structures with high temporal
resolution, and to reproduce the statistical features of the sample of merger
trees used for training, when considering up to three variables in the training
process. These inputs, whose representations are also learned by our GAN model,
are mass of the halo progenitors and the final descendant, progenitor type
(main halo or satellite) and distance of a progenitor to that in the main
branch. The inclusion of the latter two inputs greatly improves the final
learned representation of the halo mass growth history, especially for
SUBFIND-like ML trees. When comparing equally sized samples of ML merger trees
with those of the EAGLE simulation, we find better agreement for SUBFIND-like
ML trees. Finally, our GAN-based framework can be utilised to construct merger
histories of low- and intermediate-mass haloes, the most abundant in
cosmological simulations.

Title:Towards a data-driven model of the sky from low Earth orbit as observed by the Hubble Space Telescope,"
Abstract:  The sky observed by space telescopes in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) can be
dominated by stray light from multiple sources including the Earth, Sun and
Moon. This stray light presents a significant challenge to missions that aim to
make a secure measurement of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL). In this
work we quantify the impact of stray light on sky observations made by the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys. By selecting on
orbital parameters we successfully isolate images with sky that contain minimal
and high levels of Earthshine. In addition, we find weather observations from
CERES satellites correlates with the observed HST sky surface brightness
indicating the value of incorporating such data to characterise the sky.
Finally we present a machine learning model of the sky trained on the data used
in this work to predict the total observed sky surface brightness. We
demonstrate that our initial model is able to predict the total sky brightness
under a range of conditions to within 3.9% of the true measured sky. Moreover,
we find that the model matches the stray light-free observations better than
current physical Zodiacal light models.

Title:Wandering Black Hole Candidates in Dwarf Galaxies at VLBI Resolution,"
Abstract:  Thirteen dwarf galaxies have recently been found to host radio-selected
accreting massive black hole (MBH) candidates, some of which are ``wandering""
in the outskirts of their hosts. We present 9 GHz Very Long Baseline Array
(VLBA) observations of these sources at milliarcsecond resolution. Our
observations have beam solid angles ${\sim}10^4$ times smaller than the
previous Very Large Array (VLA) observations at 9 GHz, with comparable point
source sensitivities. We detect milliarcsecond-scale radio sources at the
positions of the four VLA sources most distant from the photo-centers of their
associated dwarf galaxies. These sources have brightness temperatures of
${>}10^6~\mathrm{K}$, consistent with active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but the
significance of their preferential location at large distances
($p$-value~$=0.0014$) favors a background AGN interpretation. The VLBA
non-detections toward the other 9 galaxies indicate that the VLA sources are
resolved out on scales of tens of milliarcseconds, requiring extended radio
emission and lower brightness temperatures consistent with either star
formation or radio lobes associated with AGN activity. We explore the star
formation explanation by calculating the expected radio emission for these nine
VLBA non-detections, finding that about 5 have VLA luminosities that are
inconsistent with this scenario. Of the remaining four, two are associated with
spectroscopically confirmed AGNs that are consistent with being located at
their galaxy photo-centers. There are therefore between 5 and 7 wandering MBH
candidates out of the 13 galaxies we observed, although we cannot rule out
background AGNs for five of them with the data in hand.

Title:Boostless Cosmological Collider Bootstrap,"
Abstract:  Cosmological correlation functions contain valuable information about the
primordial Universe, with possible signatures of new massive particles at very
high energies. Recent developments, including the cosmological bootstrap, bring
new perspectives and powerful tools to study these observables. In this paper,
we systematically classify inflationary three-point correlators of scalar
perturbations using the bootstrap method. For the first time, we derive a
complete set of single-exchange cosmological collider bispectra with new shapes
and potentially detectable signals. Specifically, we focus on the primordial
scalar bispectra generated from the exchange of massive particles with all
possible boost-breaking interactions during inflation. We introduce three-point
""seed"" functions, from which we bootstrap the inflationary bispectra of scalar
and spinning exchanges using weight-shifting and spin-raising operators. The
computation of the seed function requires solving an ordinary differential
equation in comoving momenta, a boundary version of the equation of motion
satisfied by a propagator that linearly mixes a massive particle with the
external light scalars. The resulting correlators are presented in analytic
form, for any kinematics. These shapes are of interest for near-future
cosmological surveys, as the primordial non-Gaussianity in boost-breaking
theories can be large. We also identify new features in these shapes, which are
phenomenologically distinct from the de Sitter invariant cases. For example,
the oscillatory shapes around the squeezed limit have different phases.
Furthermore, when the massive particle has much lower speed of sound than the
inflaton, oscillatory features appear around the equilateral configuration.

Title:Prospects for the observation of continuous gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars lensed by the galactic supermassive black hole,"
Abstract:  We study the prospects of detecting continuous gravitational waves (CGWs)
from spinning neutron stars, gravitationally lensed by the galactic
supermassive black hole. Assuming various astrophysically motivated spatial
distributions of galactic neutron stars, we find that CGW signals from a few
($\sim 0-6$) neutron stars should be strongly lensed. Lensing will produce two
copies of the signal (with time delays of seconds to minutes) that will
interfere with each other. The relative motion of the neutron star with respect
to the lensing optical axis will change the interference pattern, which will
help us to identify a lensed signal. Accounting for the magnifications and time
delays of the lensed signals, we investigate their detectability by
ground-based detectors. Assuming an ellipticity of $\epsilon = 10^{-7}$ and the
spin distribution of known pulsars, lensed CGWs are unlikely to be detectable
by LIGO and Virgo in realistic searches involving $\mathcal{O}(10^{12})$
templates. However, third-generation detectors are likely to observe some of
them. For the spatial and spin distributions of NSs that we consider, the
probability of detecting at least one lensed NS is $\sim 1\%-44\%$. Such an
observation will enable interesting probes of the supermassive black hole and
its environment.

"Title:Avoiding the ""Great Filter"": An Assessment of Climate Change Solutions and Combinations for Effective Implementation","
Abstract:  Climate change is the long-term shift in global weather patterns, largely
caused by anthropogenic activity of greenhouse gas emissions. Global climate
temperatures have unmistakably risen and naturally occurring climate
variability alone cannot account for this trend. Human activities are estimated
to have caused about 1.0 degree C of global warming above the pre-industrial
baseline and if left unchecked, will continue to drastically damage the Earth
and its inhabitants. Globally, natural disasters and subsequent economic losses
have become increasingly impactful because of climate change. Both wildlife
ecosystems and human habitats have been negatively impacted, from rising sea
levels to alarming frequency of severe weather events around the world.
Attempts towards alleviating the effects of global warming have often been at
odds and remain divided among a multitude of strategies, reducing the overall
effectiveness of these efforts. It is evident that collaborative action is
required for avoiding the most severe consequences of climate change. This
paper evaluates the main strategies (industrial/energy, political, economic,
agricultural, atmospheric, geological, coastal, and social) towards both
mitigating and adapting to climate change. As well, it provides an optimal
combination of seven solutions which can be implemented simultaneously, working
in tandem to limit and otherwise accommodate the harmful effects of climate
change. Previous legislation and deployment techniques are also discussed as
guides for future endeavors.

Title:Implications from secondary emission from neutral impact on Cassini plasma and dust measurements,"
Abstract:  We investigate the role of secondary electron and ion emission from impact of
gas molecules on the Cassini Langmuir Probe (RPWS-LP, or LP) measurements in
the ionosphere of Saturn. We add a model of the emission currents, based on
laboratory measurements and data from comet 1P/Halley, to the equations used to
derive plasma parameters from LP bias voltage sweeps. Reanalysing several
hundred sweeps from the Cassini Grand Finale orbits, we find reasonable
explanations for three open conundrums from previous LP studies of the Saturn
ionosphere. We find an explanation for the observed positive charging of the
Cassini spacecraft, the possibly overestimated ionospheric electron
temperatures, and the excess ion current reported. For the sweeps analysed in
detail, we do not find (indirect or direct) evidence of dust having a
significant charge-carrying role in Saturn's ionosphere. We also produce an
estimate of H2O number density from the last six revolutions of Cassini through
Saturn's ionosphere in higher detail than reported by the Ion and Neutral Mass
Spectrometer (INMS). Our analysis reveals an ionosphere that is highly
structured in latitude across all six final revolutions, with mixing ratios
varying with two orders of magnitude in latitude and one order of magnitude
between revolutions and altitude. The result is generally consistent with an
empirical photochemistry model balancing the production of H+ ions with the H+
loss through charge transfer with e.g., H2O, CH4 and CO2, for which water
vapour appears as the likeliest dominant source of the signal in terms of yield
and concentration.

Title:Dark matter properties from the Fornax globular cluster timing: dynamical friction and cored profiles,"
Abstract:  I summarize our recent results to use the orbits of globular clusters (GCs)
in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy to learn more about dark matter
(DM) properties. Our focus is on clarifying how dynamical friction (DF) from
the DM halo is modified from the different microscopic properties of DM, which
may alter $both$ the scattering processes responsible of DF and the DM profiles
(in particular generating a core), which also modifies DF. We consider: $(i)$
fermionic degenerate dark matter (DDM), where Pauli blocking should be taken
into account in the dynamical friction computation; $(ii)$ self-interacting
dark matter (SIDM) and $(iii)$ ultralight dark matter (ULDM), for which this
problem has been addressed by a variety of methods in recent literature. We
derive DF with a Fokker-Planck formalism, reproducing previous results for ULDM
and cold DM, while providing new results for DDM. Furthermore, ULDM, DDM and
SIDM may generate cores in dSphs, which suppress dynamical friction and prolong
GC orbits. We conclude that in all these cases the modifications in the DM
modelling does not easily solve the so-called timing `problem' of Fornax GCs.
We finally study this `problem' in terms of the initial conditions,
demonstrating that the observed orbits of Fornax GCs are consistent with this
expectation of a cuspy DM profile with a mild `fine-tuning' at the level of
$\sim25\%$.

Abstract:  We consider the effects of an uncorrelated random potential on the properties
of Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) dark matter halos, which acts as a source of
disorder, and which is added as a new term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation,
describing the properties of the halo. By using the hydrodynamic representation
we derive the basic equation describing the density distribution of the
galactic dark matter halo, by also taking into account the effects of the
baryonic matter, and of the rotation. The density, mass and tangential velocity
profiles are obtained exactly in spherical symmetry by considering a simple
exponential density profile for the baryonic matter, and a Gaussian type
disorder potential. To test the theoretical model we compare its predictions
with a set of 39 galaxies from the Spitzer Photometry \& Accurate Rotation
Curves (SPARC) database. We obtain estimates of the relevant astrophysical
parameters of the dark matter dominated galaxies, including the baryonic matter
properties, and the parameters of the random potential. The BEC model in the
presence of baryonic matter and a random confining potential gives a good
statistical description of the SPARC data. The presence of the condensate dark
matter could also provide a solution for the core/cusp problem.

Title:The Cost of Lunar Landing Pads with a Trade Study of Construction Methods,"
Abstract:  This study estimates the cost of building lunar landing pads and examines
whether any construction methods are economically superior to others. Some
proposed methods require large amounts of mass transported from the Earth,
others require high energy consumption on the lunar surface, and others have a
long construction time. Each of these factors contributes direct and indirect
costs to lunar activities. The most important economic variables turn out to be
the transportation cost to the lunar surface and the magnitude of the program
delay cost imposed by a construction method. The cost of a landing pad depends
sensitively on the optimization of the mass and speed of the construction
equipment, so a minimum-cost set of equipment exists for each construction
method within a specified economic scenario. Several scenarios have been
analyzed across a range of transportation costs with both high and low program
delay costs. It is found that microwave sintering is currently the most
favorable method to build the inner, high temperature zone of a lunar landing
pad, although other methods are within the range of uncertainty. The most
favorable method to build the outer, low temperature zone of the landing pad is
also sintering when transportation costs are high, but it switches to polymer
infusion when transportation costs drop below about \$110K/kg to the lunar
surface. It is estimated that the Artemis Basecamp could build a landing pad
with a budgeted line-item cost of \$229M assuming that transportation costs
will be reduced modestly from the current rate \$1M/kg to the lunar surface to
\$300K/kg. A landing pad drops to \$130M when the transportation cost drops
further to \$100K/kg, or to \$47M if transportation costs fall below \$10K/kg.
Ultimately, landing pads can be built around the Moon at very low cost, due to
economies of scale.

Title:Polarization distribution in the image of a synchrotron emitting ring around a regular black hole,"
Abstract:  The polarized images of a synchrotron emitting ring are studied in the

carry a magnetic field in terms of gravity coupled to nonlinear

of the emitting rings are similar in these two regular black hole spacetimes.
As the magnetic charge parameter increase, the polarization intensity and the
electric vector position angle in the image plane increase in Hayward and
Bardeen black hole spacetimes. Moreover, the polarization intensity and
electric vector position angle in the image of the emitting ring in the Hayward
black hole spacetime are closer to those in the Schwarzschild case. The effects
of the magnetic charge parameter on the Strokes $Q-U$ loops are also slightly
smaller in the Hayward black hole spacetime. This information stored in the

Abstract:  Cosmic background neutrinos ($C_{\nu}B)$ helicity composition is different
for Dirac or Majorana neutrinos making detectors based on $C_{\nu}B$ capture
sensitive to the nature of neutrinos. We calculate, for the first time, the
helicity changes of neutrinos crossing dark matter fields, to quantitatively
calculate this effect on the capture rate. We show that a fraction of neutrinos
change their helicity, regardless of them being deflected by a void or a dark
matter halo. The average signal from the 100 most massive voids or halos in a
Gpc$^3$ gives a prediction that if neutrinos are Dirac, the density of the
$C_{\nu} B$ background measured on Earth should be 48 cm${^{-3}}$ for
left-helical neutrinos, a decrease of 15% (53.6 cm${^{-3}}$; 5%) for a halo
(void) with respect to the standard calculation without including gravitational
effects due to large scale structures. In terms of the total capture rate in a
100 g tritium detector, this translates in $4.9^{+1.1}_{-0.8}$ neutrinos per
year for the Dirac case, as a function of the unknown neutrino mass scale, or
8.1 per year if neutrinos are Majorana. Thus although smaller than the factor
two for the non-relativistic case, it is still large enough to be detected and
it highlights the power of future $C_{\nu} B$ detectors, as an alternative to
neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, to discover the neutrino nature.

that the equation of motion of general relativity follows from the geometry of
Riemannian spacetime manifold without appeal to anything else from outside. The
driving differential geometric property is the Bianchi identity satisfied by
the Riemann curvature tensor. Similarly it is geometry of the principal tangent
bundle of fibre spacetime manifold that may account for dynamics of the gauge
vector fields. It is the classical electric force for the Abelian gauge
symmetry group while the non-Abelian symmetry leads to the non-Abelian forces,
the weak and the strong. We shall also reflect on a unified picture of the
basic forces, and the duality correspondences it may inspire.

case of a homogeneous Affleck-Dine field transmitting the charge stored in its

additional symmetries this charge transfer, aided by cosmic expansion as well
as the thermal effective potential of the Affleck-Dine field, can be very
efficient. The charge redistribution between the scalar fields becomes possible
if the interactions with the thermal bath break the original U(1) x U(1)
symmetry down to a single U(1) symmetry; the charge distribution between the
two fields is then determined by minimizing the free energy. We discuss
implications for cosmological setups involving complex scalars, with

Title:Instabilities Appearing in Effective Field theories: When and How?,"
Abstract:  Nonlinear partial differential equations appear in many domains of physics,
and we study here a typical equation which one finds in effective field
theories (EFT) originated from cosmological studies. In particular, we are
interested in the equation $\partial_t^2 u(x,t) = \alpha (\partial_x u(x,t))^2
+\beta \partial_x^2 u(x,t)$ in $1+1$ dimensions. It has been known for quite
some time that solutions to this equation diverge in finite time, when $\alpha
>0$. We study the detailed nature of this divergence as a function of the
parameters $\alpha>0 $ and $\beta\ge0$. The divergence does not disappear even
when $\beta $ is very large contrary to what one might believe. But it will
take longer to appear as $\beta$ increases when $\alpha$ is fixed. We note that
there are two types of divergence and we discuss the transition between these
two as a function of parameter choices. The blowup is unavoidable unless the
corresponding equations are modified. Our results extend to $3+1$ dimensions.

Title:Anisotropic cosmic optical background bound for decaying dark matter in light of the LORRI anomaly,"
Abstract:  Recently anomalous flux in the cosmic optical background (COB) is reported by
the New Horizon observations. The COB flux is $16.37\pm1.47\, \rm nW m^{-2}
sr^{-1}$, at the LORRI pivot wavelength of $0.608\,\rm \mu m$, which is $\sim
4\sigma$ level above the expected flux from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
galaxy count. It would be great if this were a hint for the eV scale dark
matter decaying into photons. In this paper, we point out that such a decaying
dark matter model predicts a substantial amount of anisotropy in the COB flux,
which is accurately measured by the HST. The data of the HST excludes the decay
rate of the dominant cold dark matter larger than $10^{-24}$-$10^{-23}\,{\rm
s}^{-1}$ in the mass range of $5$-$20\,$eV. As a result, the decaying cold dark
matter explaining the COB excess is excluded by the anisotropy bound. We
discuss some loopholes: e.g. warm/hot dark matter or two-step decay of the dark
matter to explain the COB excess.

Title:The diffuse supernova neutrino background as a probe of late-time neutrino mass generation,"
Abstract:  The relic neutrinos from old supernova explosions are among the most ancient
neutrino fluxes within experimental reach. Thus, the diffuse supernova neutrino
background (DSNB) could teach us if neutrino masses were different in the past
(redshifts $z\lesssim 5$). Oscillations inside the supernova depend strongly on
the neutrino mass-squared differences and the values of the mixing angles,
rendering the DSNB energy spectrum sensitive to variations of these parameters.
Considering a purely phenomenological parameterization of the neutrino masses
as a function of redshift, we compute the expected local DSNB spectrum here on
Earth. Given the current knowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters,
specially the fact that $|U_{e3}|^2$ is small, we find that the $\nu_e$
spectrum could be significantly different from standard expectations if
neutrinos were effectively massless at $z\gtrsim1$ as long as the neutrino mass
ordering is normal. On the other hand, the $\overline{\nu}_e$ flux is not
expected to be significantly impacted. Hence, a measurement of both the
neutrino and antineutrino components of the DSNB should allow one to test the
possibility of recent neutrino mass generation.

Title:Classical Cosmological Collider Physics and Primordial Features,"
Abstract:  Features in the inflationary landscape can inject extra energies to inflation
models and produce on-shell particles with masses much larger than the Hubble
scale of inflation. This possibility extends the energy reach of the program of
cosmological collider physics, in which signals associated with these particles
are generically Boltzmann-suppressed. We study the mechanisms of this classical
cosmological collider in two categories of primordial features. In the first
category, the primordial feature is classical oscillation, which includes the
case of coherent oscillation of a massive field and the case of oscillatory
features in the inflationary potential. The second category includes any sharp
feature in the inflation model. All these classical features can excite
unsuppressed quantum modes of other heavy fields which leave observational
signatures in primordial non-Gaussianities, including the information about the
particle spectra of these heavy degrees of freedom.

Title:Bayesian Inference of Phenomenological EoS of Neutron Stars with Recent Observations,"
Abstract:  The description of stellar interior remains as a big challenge for the
nuclear astrophysics community. The consolidated knowledge is restricted to
density regions around the saturation of hadronic matter $\rho _{0} = 2.8\times
10^{14} {\rm\ g\ cm^{-3}}$, regimes where our nuclear models are successfully
applied. As one moves towards higher densities and extreme conditions up to
five to twenty times $\rho_{0}$, little can be said about the microphysics of
such objects. Here, we employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategy to
access the variability of polytropic three-pircewised models for neutron star
equation of state. With a fixed description of the hadronic matter, we explore
a variety of models for the high density regimes leading to stellar masses up
to $2.5\ M_{\odot}$. In addition, we also discuss the use of a Bayesian power
regression model with heteroscedastic error. The set of EoS from the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was used as inputs and
treated as data set for testing case.

Title:Determining the equation of state of neutron stars with Einstein Telescope using tidal effects and r-mode excitations from a population of binary inspirals,"
Abstract:  Third-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as Einstein
Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) will be ideal instruments to probe the
structure of neutron stars through the GWs they emit when undergoing binary
coalescence. In this work we make predictions about how well ET in particular
will enable us to reconstruct the neutron star equation of state through
observations of tens of binary neutron star coalescences with signal-to-noise
ratios in the hundreds. We restrict ourselves to information that can be
extracted from the inspiral, which includes tidal effects and possibly r-mode
resonances. In treating the latter we go beyond the Newtonian approximation,
introducing and utilizing new universal relations. We find that the ability to
observe resonant r-modes would have a noticeable impact on neutron star
equation of state measurements with ET.

Title:Mechanism for Sequestering Magnetic Energy at Large Scales in Shear-Flow Turbulence,"
Abstract:  Straining of magnetic fields by large-scale shear flow, generally assumed to
lead to intensification and generation of small scales, is re-examined in light
of the persistent observation of large-scale magnetic fields in astrophysics.
It is shown that, in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, unstable shear flows have
the unexpected effect of sequestering magnetic energy at large scales, due to
counteracting straining motion of nonlinearly excited large-scale stable
eigenmodes. This effect is quantified via dissipation rates, energy transfer
rates, and visualizations of magnetic field evolution by artificially removing
the stable modes. These analyses show that predictions based upon physics of
the linear instability alone miss substantial dynamics, including those of
magnetic fluctuations.

Title:Emission Variation of a Long-period Pulsar Discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST),"
Abstract:  We report on the variation in the single-pulse emission from PSR J1900+4221
(CRAFTS 19C10) observed at frequency centered at 1.25 GHz using the
Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. The integrated pulse
profile shows two distinct components, referred to here as the leading and
trailing components, with the latter component also containing a third weak
component. The single-pulse sequence reveals different emissions demonstrating
as nulling, regular, and bright pulses, each with a particular abundance and
duration distribution. There also exists pulses that follow a log-normal
distribution suggesting the possibility of another emission, in which the
pulsar is radiating weakly. Changes in the profile shape are seen across
different emissions. We examine the emission variations in the leading and
trailing components collectively and separately, and find moderate correlation
between the two components. The inclination angle is estimated to be about
7 based on pulse-width, and we discuss that nulling in this pulsar does
not seem to show correlation with age and rotation period.

Title:The robustness of slow contraction and the shape of the scalar field potential,"
Abstract:  We use numerical relativity simulations to explore the conditions for a
canonical scalar field $\phi$ minimally coupled to Einstein gravity to generate
an extended phase of slow contraction that robustly smooths the universe for a
wide range of initial conditions and then sets the conditions for a graceful
exit stage. We show that to achieve robustness it suffices that the potential
$V(\phi)$ is negative and $M_{\rm Pl}|V_{,\phi}/V|\gtrsim5$ during the
smoothing phase. We also show that, to exit slow contraction, the potential
must have a minimum. Beyond the minimum, we find no constraint on the uphill
slope including the possibility of ending on a positive potential plateau or a
local minimum with $V_{\rm min}>0$. Our study establishes ultralocality for a
wide range of potentials as a key both to robust smoothing and to graceful
exit.

Title:Critical Balance and Scaling of Stably Stratified Turbulence at Low Prandtl Number,"
Abstract:  We extend the scaling relations of stably stratified turbulence from the
geophysical regime of unity Prandtl number to the astrophysical regime of
extremely small Prandtl number applicable to stably stratified regions of stars
and gas giants. A transition to a new turbulent regime is found to occur when
the Prandtl number drops below the inverse of the buoyancy Reynolds number,
i.e. $PrRb<1$, which signals a shift of the dominant balance in the buoyancy
equation. Application of critical balance arguments then derives new
predictions for the anisotropic energy spectrum and dominant balance of the
Boussinesq equations in the $PrRb\ll1$ regime. We find that all the standard
scaling relations from the unity $Pr$ limit of stably stratified turbulence
simply carry over if the Froude number, $Fr$, is replaced by a modified Froude
number, $Fr_M\equiv Fr/(PrRb)^{1/4}$. The geophysical and astrophysical regimes
are thus smoothly connected across the $PrRb=1$ transition. Applications to
vertical transport in stellar radiative zones and modification to the
instability criterion for the small-scale dynamo are discussed.

Title:Virgo Detector Characterization and Data Quality during the O3 run,"
Abstract:  The Advanced Virgo detector has contributed with its data to the rapid growth
of the number of detected gravitational-wave signals in the past few years,
alongside the two LIGO instruments. First, during the last month of the
Observation Run 2 (O2) in August 2017 (with, most notably, the compact binary
mergers GW170814 and GW170817) and then during the full Observation Run 3 (O3):
an 11 months data taking period, between April 2019 and March 2020, that led to
the addition of about 80 events to the catalog of transient gravitational-wave
sources maintained by LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA. These discoveries and the manifold
exploitation of the detected waveforms require an accurate characterization of
the quality of the data, such as continuous study and monitoring of the
detector noise. These activities, collectively named {\em detector
characterization} or {\em DetChar}, span the whole workflow of the Virgo data,
from the instrument front-end to the final analysis. They are described in
details in the following article, with a focus on the associated tools, the
results achieved by the Virgo DetChar group during the O3 run and the main
prospects for future data-taking periods with an improved detector.

Abstract:  We consider the motion of a point particle in a stationary spacetime under
the influence of a scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational self-force. We show
that the conservative piece of the first-order self-force gives rise to
Hamiltonian dynamics, and we derive an explicit expression for the Hamiltonian
on phase space. Specialized to the Kerr spacetime, our result generalizes the
Hamiltonian function previously obtained by Fujita et. al., which is valid only
for non-resonant orbits. We discuss implications for the first law of binary

Title:Improved stellar limits on a light CP-even scalar,"
Abstract:  We derive improved stellar luminosity limits on a generic light CP-even
scalar field $S$ mixing with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson from the
supernova SN1987A, the Sun, red giants (RGs) and white dwarfs (WDs). For the
first time, we include the geometric effects for the decay and absorption of
$S$ particles in the stellar interior. For SN1987A and the Sun, we also take
into account the detailed stellar profiles. We find that a broad range of the
scalar mass and mixing angle can be excluded by our updated astrophysical
constraints. For instance, SN1987A excludes $1.0\times10^{-7} \lesssim
\sin\theta \lesssim 3.0\times 10^{-5}$ and scalar mass up to 219 MeV, which
covers the cosmological blind spot with a high reheating temperature. The
updated solar limit excludes the mixing angle in the range of $1.5\times
10^{-12} < \sin\theta < 1$, with scalar mass up to 45 keV. The RG and WD limits
are updated to $5.3\times 10^{-13} < \sin \theta < 0.39$ and $2.8\times
10^{-18} < \sin \theta < 1.8\times 10^{-4}$, with scalar mass up to 392 keV and
290 keV, respectively.

Title:Amplitude modulation in binary gravitational lensing of gravitational waves,"
Abstract:  We investigate the detectability of gravitational waves (GWs) lensed by a
system that consists of binary black holes as lenses using time-domain
numerical simulations. The gravitational lensing potential of this system is no
longer static but evolves with time. When GWs from the source pass through the
binary lens, their amplitudes can be modulated, which is similar to the
phenomenon of amplitude modulation (AM) in radio communication. We find that
even the frequency of the binary lens itself is too low to be detected by the
LISA detection band, the sidebands in the spectrum of the lensed GWs due to AM
can still be within the sensitive range of the detection band. Moreover, we
also calculate the relative differences of SNR (mismatch) between the lensed
and unlensed GWs. We find that the {\it mismatch} can be as significant as
9.18%. Since mismatch does not depend on the amplitude of wavefrom, the
differences between the binary lensed and unlensed waveforms are substantial.
This provides a robust way to identify the lensing event for the LISA project
in the future.
