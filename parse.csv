"Title:Discovery of ammonia (9,6) masers in two high-mass star-forming regions","
Abstract:  Molecular maser lines are signposts of high-mass star formation, probing
excitation and kinematics of very compact regions in the close environment of
young stellar objects and providing useful targets for trigonometric parallax
measurements. Only a few NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers were known so far, and their
origin is still poorly understood. Here we aim to find new NH$_{3}$ (9,6)
masers to provide a better observational basis to study their role in high-mass
star-forming regions. We carried out NH$_{3}$ (9,6) observations toward Cepheus
A and G34.26$+$0.15 with the Effelsberg-100 m telescope and the Karl G. Janksy
Very Large Array. We discovered new NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers in Cep A and
G34.26$+$0.15, which increases the number of high-mass star-forming regions
hosting NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers from five to seven. Long term monitoring (20
months) at Effelsberg shows that the intensity of the (9,6) maser in
G34.26$+$0.15 is decreasing, while the Cep A maser remains stable. Compared to
the Effelsberg data and assuming linear variations between the epochs of
observation, the JVLA data indicate no missing flux. This suggests that the
NH$_3$ (9,6) emission arises from single compact emission regions that are not
resolved by the interferometric measurements. As JVLA imaging shows, the
NH$_{3}$ (9,6) emission in Cep A originates from a sub-arcsecond sized region,
slightly to the west of the peak position of the 1.36\,cm continuum object,
HW2. In G34.26$+$0.15, three NH$_{3}$ (9,6) maser spots are observed: one is
close to the head of the cometary ultracompact \h2 region C and the other two
are emitted from a compact region to the west of the hypercompact \h2 region A.
The newly found (9,6) masers appear to be related to outflows. Higher angular
resolution of JVLA and VLBI observations are needed to provide more accurate
positions and constraints for pumping scenarios.

Title:The Formation of Intermediate Mass Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei,"
Abstract:  Most stellar evolution models predict that black holes (BHs) should not exist
above approximately $50-70$ M$_\odot$, the lower limit of the pair-instability
mass gap. However, recent LIGO/Virgo detections indicate the existence of BHs
with masses at and above this threshold. We suggest that massive BHs, including
intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), can form in galactic nuclei through
collisions between stellar-mass black holes and the surrounding main-sequence
stars. Considering dynamical processes such as collisions, mass segregation,
and relaxation, we find that this channel can be quite efficient, forming IMBHs
as massive as $10^4$ M$_\odot$. This upper limit assumes that (1) the BHs
accrete a substantial fraction of the stellar mass captured during each
collision and (2) that the rate at which new stars are introduced into the
region near the SMBH is high enough to offset depletion by stellar disruptions
and star-star collisions. We discuss deviations from these key assumptions in
the text. Our results suggest that BHs in the pair-instability mass gap and
IMBHs may be ubiquitous in galactic centers. This formation channel has
implications for observations. Collisions between stars and BHs can produce
electromagnetic signatures, for example, from x-ray binaries and tidal
disruption events. Additionally, formed through this channel, both black holes
in the mass gap and IMBHs can merge with the supermassive black hole at the
center of a galactic nucleus through gravitational waves. These gravitational
wave events are extreme and intermediate mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs and IMRIs,
respectively).

Title:Exploring new techniques for analyzing variability in white dwarf KIC 8626021,"
Abstract:  As is common with the collection of astronomical data, signals are frequently
dominated by noise. However, when performing FTs of light curves, re-binning
data can improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at lower frequencies. Using
data collected from the Kepler space telescope, we sequentially re-binned data
three times to investigate the SNR improvement of lower frequency (< 17
microHz) variability in white dwarf KIC 8626021. We found that the SNR at
approximately 5.8 microHz greatly improved through this process, and we
postulate that this frequency is linked to the rotation of KIC 8626021.

Title:The influence of a fluid core and a solid inner core on the Cassini sate of Mercury,"
Abstract:  We present a model of the Cassini state of Mercury that comprises an inner
core, a fluid core and a mantle. Our model includes inertial and gravitational
torques between interior regions, and viscous and electromagnetic (EM) coupling
at the boundaries of the fluid core. We show that the coupling between
Mercury's interior regions is sufficiently strong that the obliquity of the
mantle spin axis deviates from that of a rigid planet by no more than 0.01
arcmin. The mantle obliquity decreases with increasing inner core size, but the
change between a large and no inner core is limited to 0.015 arcmin. EM
coupling is stronger than viscous coupling at the inner core boundary and, if
the core magnetic field strength is above 0.3 mT, locks the fluid and solid
cores into a common precession motion. Because of the strong gravitational
coupling between the mantle and inner core, the larger the inner core is, the
more this co-precessing core is brought into an alignment with the mantle, and
the more the obliquity of the polar moment of inertia approaches that expected
for a rigid planet. The misalignment between the polar moment of inertia and
mantle spin axis increases with inner core size, but is limited to 0.007
arcmin. Our results imply that the measured obliquities of the mantle spin axis
and polar moment of inertia should coincide at the present-day level of
measurement errors, and cannot be distinguished from the obliquity of a rigid
planet.

"Title:A MeerKAT, e-MERLIN, H.E.S.S. and Swift search for persistent and transient emission associated with three localised FRBs","
Abstract:  We report on a search for persistent radio emission from the one-off Fast
Radio Burst (FRB) 20190714A, as well as from two repeating FRBs, 20190711A and
20171019A, using the MeerKAT radio telescope. For FRB 20171019A we also
conducted simultaneous observations with the High Energy Stereoscopic System
(H.E.S.S.) in very high energy gamma rays and searched for signals in the
ultraviolet, optical, and X-ray bands. For this FRB, we obtain a UV flux upper
limit of 1.39x10^-16 erg/cm^-2/s/Amstrong, X-ray limit of ~ 6.6x10^-14
erg/cm^-2/s and a limit on the very-high-energy gamma-ray flux (Phi) (E > 120
GeV) < 1.7 x 10^-12 erg/cm^-2/s. We obtain a radio upper limit of ~15
microJy/beam for persistent emission at the locations of both FRBs 20190711A
and 20171019A, but detect diffuse radio emission with a peak brightness of ~53
microJy/beam associated with FRB 20190714A at z = 0.2365. This represents the
first detection of the radio continuum emission potentially associated with the
host (galaxy) of FRB 20190714A, and is only the third known FRB to have such an
association. Given the possible association of a faint persistent source, FRB
20190714A may potentially be a repeating FRB whose age lies between that of FRB
20121102A and FRB 20180916A. A parallel search for repeat bursts from these
FRBs revealed no new detections down to a fluence of 0.08 Jy ms for a 1 ms
duration burst.

Title:Multiple stellar populations in Schwarzschild modeling and the application to the Fornax dwarf,"
Abstract:  Dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are believed to be strongly dark matter
dominated and thus are considered perfect objects to study dark matter
distribution and test theories of structure formation. They possess resolved,
multiple stellar populations that offer new possibilities for modeling. A
promising tool for the dynamical modeling of these objects is the Schwarzschild
orbit superposition method. In this work we extend our previous implementation
of the scheme to include more than one population of stars and a more general
form of the mass-to-light ratio function. We tested the improved approach on a
nearly spherical, gas-free galaxy formed in the cosmological context from the
Illustris simulation. We modeled the binned velocity moments for stars split
into two populations by metallicity and demonstrate that in spite of larger
sampling errors the increased number of constraints leads to significantly
tighter confidence regions on the recovered density and velocity anisotropy
profiles. We then applied the method to the Fornax dSph galaxy with stars
similarly divided into two populations. In comparison with our earlier work, we
find the anisotropy parameter to be slightly increasing, rather than
decreasing, with radius and more strongly constrained. We are also able to
infer anisotropy for each stellar population separately and find them to be
significantly different.

Title:Imaging the Sun's near-surface flows using mode-coupling analysis,"
Abstract:  The technique of normal-mode coupling is a powerful tool with which to
seismically image non-axisymmetric phenomena in the Sun. Here we apply mode
coupling in the Cartesian approximation to probe steady, near-surface flows in
the Sun. Using Doppler cubes obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we perform inversions on mode-coupling
measurements to show that the resulting divergence and radial vorticity maps at
supergranular length scales ($\sim$30 Mm) near the surface compare extremely
well with those obtained using the Local Correlation Tracking method. We find
that the Pearson correlation coefficient is $\geq$ 0.9 for divergence flows,
while $\geq$ 0.8 is obtained for the radial vorticity.

Title:Local heating due to convective overshooting and the solar modelling problem,"
Abstract:  Recent hydrodynamical simulations of convection in a solar-like model suggest
that penetrative convective flows at the boundary of the convective envelope
modify the thermal background in the overshooting layer. Based on these
results, we implement in one-dimensional stellar evolution codes a simple
prescription to modify the temperature gradient below the convective boundary
of a solar model. This simple prescription qualitatively reproduces the
behaviour found in the hydrodynamical simulations, namely a local heating and
smoothing of the temperature gradient below the convective boundary. We show
that introducing local heating in the overshooting layer can reduce the
sound-speed discrepancy usually reported between solar models and the structure
of the Sun inferred from helioseismology. It also affects key quantities in the
convective envelope, such as the density, the entropy, and the speed of sound.
These effects could help reduce the discrepancies between solar models and
observed constraints based on seismic inversions of the Ledoux discriminant.
Since mixing due to overshooting and local heating are the result of the same
convective penetration process, the goal of this work is to invite solar
modellers to consider both processes for a more consistent approach.

Title:The period-age relation of long-period variables,"
Abstract:  Pieces of empirical evidence suggest the existence of a period-age relation
for long-period variables (LPVs). Yet, this property has hardly been studied on
theoretical grounds thus far. We aim to examine the period-age relation using
the results from recent nonlinear pulsation calculations. We combined isochrone
models with theoretical periods to simulate the distribution of fundamental
mode LPV pulsators, which include Miras, in the period-age plane, and we
compared it with observations of LPVs in Galactic and Magellanic Clouds'
clusters. In agreement with observations, models predict that the fundamental
mode period decreases with increasing age because of the dominant role of mass
in shaping stellar structure and evolution. At a given age, the period
distribution shows a non-negligible width and is skewed toward short periods,
except for young C-rich stars. As a result, the period-age relations of O-rich
and C-rich models are predicted to have different slopes. We derived best-fit
relations describing age and initial mass as a function of the fundamental mode
period for both O- and C-rich models. The study confirms the power of the
period-age relations to study populations of LPVs of specific types, either
O-rich or C-rich, on statistical grounds. In doing so, it is recommended not to
limit a study to Miras, which would make it prone to selection biases, but
rather to include semi-regular variables that pulsate predominantly in the
fundamental mode. The use of the relations to study individual LPVs, on the
other hand, requires more care given the scatter in the period distribution
predicted at any given age.

Title:Temperature Analysis of Flaring (AR11283) and non-Flaring (AR12194) Coronal Loops,"
Abstract:  Here, we study the temperature structure of flaring and non-flaring coronal
loops, using extracted loops from images taken in six extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
channels recorded by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)/ Solar Dynamic
Observatory (SDO). We use data for loops of X2.1-class-flaring active region
(AR11283) during 22:10UT till 23:00UT, on 2011, September 6; and non-flaring
active region (AR12194) during 08:00:00UT till 09:00:00UT on 2014, October 26.
By using spatially-synthesized Gaussian DEM forward-fitting method, we
calculate the peak temperatures for each strip of the loops. We apply the
Lomb-Scargle method to compute the oscillations periods for the temperature
series of each strip. The periods of the temperature oscillations for the
flaring loops are ranged from 7 min to 28.4 min. These temperature oscillations
show very close behavior to the slow-mode oscillation. We observe that the
temperature oscillations in the flaring loops are started at least around 10
minutes before the transverse oscillations and continue for a long time
duration even after the transverse oscillations are ended. The temperature
amplitudes are increased at the flaring time (during 20 min) in the flaring
loops. The periods of the temperatures obtained for the non-flaring loops are
ranged from 8.5 min to 30 min, but their significances are less (below 0.5) in
comparison with the flaring ones (near to one). Hence the detected temperature
periods for the non-flaring loops' strips are less probable in comparison with
the flaring ones, and maybe they are just fluctuations.
Based on our confined observations, it seems that the flaring loops' periods
show more diversity and their temperatures have wider ranges of variation than
the non-flaring ones. More accurate commentary in this respect requires more
extensive statistical research and broader observations.

Title:Extremely strong DLAs at high redshift: Gas cooling and H$_2$ formation,"
Abstract:  We present a spectroscopic investigation with VLT/X-shooter of seven
candidate extremely strong damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption systems (ESDLAs,
$N(\text{HI})\ge 5\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) observed along quasar sightlines.
We confirm the extremely high column densities, albeit slightly (0.1~dex) lower
than the original ESDLA definition for four systems. We measured low-ionisation
metal abundances and dust extinction for all systems. For two systems we also
found strong associated H$_2$ absorption $\log
N(\text{H$_2$)[cm$^{-2}$]}=18.16\pm0.03$ and $19.28\pm0.06$ at $z=3.26$ and
$2.25$ towards J2205+1021 and J2359+1354, respectively), while for the
remaining five we measured conservative upper limits on the H$_2$ column
densities of typically $\log N(\text{H$_2$)[cm$^{-2}$]}<17.3$. The increased
H$_2$ detection rate ($10-55$% at 68% confidence level) at high HI column
density compared to the overall damped Lyman-$\alpha$ population ($\sim 5-10$%)
confirms previous works. We find that these seven ESDLAs have similar observed
properties as those previously studied towards quasars and gamma-ray burst
afterglows, suggesting they probe inner regions of galaxies. We use the
abundance of ionised carbon in excited fine-structure level to calculate the
cooling rates through the CII $\lambda$158$\mu$m emission, and compare them
with the cooling rates from damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems in the literature. We
find that the cooling rates distribution of ESDLAs also presents the same
bimodality as previously observed for the general (mostly lower HI column
density) damped Lyman-$\alpha$ population.

Title:Radio Pulsar Sub-Populations (II) : The Mysterious RRATs,"
Abstract:  Several conjectures have been put forward to explain the RRATs, the newest
subclass of neutron stars, and their connections to other radio pulsars. This
work discusses these conjectures in the context of the characteristic
properties of the RRAT population. Contrary to expectations, it is seen that -
a) the RRAT population is statistically un-correlated with the nulling pulsars,
and b) the RRAT phenomenon is unlikely to be related to old age or death-line
proximity. It is perhaps more likely that the special emission property of
RRATs is a signature of them being later evolutionary phases of other types of
neutron stars which may have resulted in restructuring of the magnetic fields.

Title:On the Mass and Magnetic Field of the Neutron Star in the Ultraluminous X-Ray Source NGC 300 ULX1,"
Abstract:  The accreting compact objects in most of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs)
are likely to be neutron stars rather than black holes as suggested by the
recent detection of periodic pulsations from some of these sources located in
neighboring galaxies and one ULX that has hitherto been discovered in our own
galaxy. As a member of the ULX family, NGC 300 ULX1 is a new pulsating ULX
(PULX) spinning up at substantially high rates compared with other PULXs. In
this paper, the strength of the magnetic field on the surface of the neutron
star is inferred from the energy of the cyclotron absorption line detected in
the pulsed X-ray spectrum of NGC 300 ULX1 and the plausible ranges for the
neutron-star mass and beaming fraction are estimated using the observed spin
period and period derivative of the pulsar and the measured X-ray flux of the
source. Our analysis favors proton cyclotron resonance scattering as a viable
mechanism to account for both the observed cyclotron energy and high spin-up
rates provided that the absorption line is generated close to the surface of
the neutron star.

Title:Gravitational-wave Emission from a Primordial Black Hole Inspiraling inside a Compact Star: a Novel Probe for Dense Matter Equation of State,"
Abstract:  Primordial black holes of planetary masses captured by compact stars are
widely studied to constrain their composition fraction of dark matter. Such a
capture may lead to an inspiral process and be detected through gravitational
wave signals. In this Letter, we study the post-capture inspiral process by
considering two different kinds of compact stars, i.e., strange stars and
neutron stars. The dynamical equations are numerically solved and the
gravitational wave emission is calculated. It is found that the Advanced LIGO
can detect the inspiraling of a $10^{-5}$ solar mass primordial black hole at a
distance of 10 kpc, while a Jovian-mass case can even be detected at
megaparsecs. Promisingly, the next generation gravitational wave detectors can
detect the cases of $10^{-5}$ solar mass primordial black holes up to $\sim1$
Mpc, and can detect Jovian-mass cases at several hundred megaparsecs. Moreover,
the kilohertz gravitational wave signal shows significant differences for
strange stars and neutron stars, potentially making it a novel probe to the
dense matter equation of state.

Title:The APEX Large CO Heterodyne Orion Legacy Survey (ALCOHOLS). I. Survey overview,"
Abstract:  The Orion molecular cloud complex harbours the nearest GMCs and site of
high-mass star formation. Its YSO populations are thoroughly characterized. The
region is therefore a prime target for the study of star formation.
Here, we verify the performance of the SuperCAM 64 pixel heterodyne array on
APEX. We give a descriptive overview of a set of wide-field CO(3-2) spectral
cubes obtained towards the Orion GMC complex, aimed at characterizing the
dynamics and structure of the extended molecular gas in diverse regions of the
clouds, ranging from very active sites of clustered star formation in Orion B
to comparatively quiet regions in southern Orion A.
We present a 2.7 square degree (130pc$^2$) mapping survey in the CO(3-2)
transition, obtained using SuperCAM on APEX at an angular resolution of 19''
(7600AU or 0.037pc at a distance of 400pc), covering L1622, NGC2071, NGC2068,
OriB9, NGC2024, and NGC2023 in Orion B, and the southern part of the L1641
cloud in Orion A.
We describe CO integrated emission and line moment maps and position-velocity
diagrams and discuss a few sub-regions in some detail. Evidence for expanding
bubbles is seen with lines splitting into double components, most prominently
in NGC2024, where we argue that the bulk of the molecular gas is in the
foreground of the HII region. High CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) line ratios reveal warm CO
along the western edge of Orion B in the NGC2023/NGC2024 region facing the
IC434 HII region. Multiple, well separated radial velocity components seen in
L1641-S suggest that it consists of a sequence of clouds at increasingly larger
distances. We find a small, spherical cloud - the 'Cow Nebula' globule - north
of NGC2071. We trace high velocity line wings for the NGC2071-IR outflow and
the NGC2024 CO jet. The protostellar dust core FIR4 (rather than FIR5) is the

Title:The Accretion flow in M87 is really MAD,"
Abstract:  The supermassive black holes in most galaxies in the universe are powered by
hot accretion flows. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations have
indicated that, depending on the degree of magnetization, black hole hot
accretion flow is divided into two modes, namely SANE (standard and normal
evolution) and MAD (magnetically arrested disk). It has been an important
question which mode the hot accretion flows in individual sources should belong
to in reality, SANE or MAD. This issue has been investigated in some previous
works but they all suffer from various uncertainties. By using the measured
rotation measure values in the prototype low-luminosity active galactic nuclei
in {M87} at 2, 5, and 8 GHz along the jet at various distances from the black
hole, combined with three dimensional general relativity magnetohydrodynamical
numerical simulations of SANE and MAD, we show in this paper that the predicted
rotation measure values by MAD are well consistent with observations, while the
SANE model overestimates the rotation measure by over two orders of magnitude
thus is ruled out.

Title:Cosmic rays from massive star clusters : A close look at Westerlund 1,"
Abstract:  We study the effect of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in the massive compact
star cluster Westerlund 1 in light of its recent detection in $\gamma$-rays.
Recent observations reveal a $1/r$ radial distribution of the CR energy
density. Here we theoretically investigate whether or not this profile can help
to distinguish between (1) continuous CR acceleration in the star cluster
stellar wind-driven shocks and (2) discrete CR acceleration in multiple
supernovae shocks -- which are often debated in the literature. Using idealized
two-fluid simulations and exploring different acceleration sites and diffusion
coefficients, we obtain the CR energy density profile and luminosity to find
the best match for the $\gamma$-ray observations. We find that the inferred CR
energy density profiles from observations of $\gamma$-ray luminosity and mass
can be much different from the true radial profile. CR acceleration at either
the cluster core region or the wind termination shock can explain the
observations, if the diffusion coefficient is $\kappa_{\rm cr}\sim 10^{27}$
cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ and a fraction of $\approx 10\%-20\%$ of the shock
power/post-shock pressure is deposited into the CR component. We also study the
possibility of discrete supernovae (SN) explosions being responsible for CR
acceleration and find that with an injection rate of 1 SN in every $\sim 0.03$
Myr, one can explain the observed $\gamma$-ray profile. This multiple SN
scenario is consistent with X-ray observations only if the thermal conductivity
is close to the Spitzer value.

Title:Abundance of beryllium in the Sun and stars: The role of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects,"
Abstract:  Earlier studies have suggested that deviations from the local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) play a minor role in the formation of Be II 313 nm resonance
lines in solar and stellar atmospheres. Recent improvements in the atomic data
allow a more complete model atom of Be to be constructed and the validity of
these claims to be reassessed using more up-to-date atomic physics. The main
goal of this study therefore is to refocus on the role of non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects in the formation of Be II 313.04 and
313.11 nm resonance lines in solar and stellar atmospheres. For this, we
constructed a model atom of Be using new atomic data that recently became
available. The model atom contains 98 levels and 383 radiative transitions of
Be I and Be II and uses the most up-to-date collision rates with electrons and
hydrogen. This makes it the most complete model atom used to determine 1D NLTE
solar Be abundance and to study the role of NLTE effects in the formation of Be
II 313 nm resonance lines. We find that deviations from LTE have a significant
influence on the strength of the Be II 313 nm line in solar and stellar
atmospheres. For the Sun, we obtained the 1D NLTE Be abundance of A(Be)_NLTE =
1.32+/-0.05, which is in excellent agreement with the meteoritic value of
A(Be)=1.31+/-0.04. Importantly, we find that NLTE effects become significant in
FGK stars. Moreover, there is a pronounced variation in 1D NLTE-LTE abundance
corrections with the effective temperature and metallicity. Therefore, contrary
to our previous understanding, the obtained results indicate that NLTE effects
play an important role in Be line formation in stellar atmospheres and have to
be properly taken into account in Be abundance studies, especially in
metal-poor stars.

imaging of our sample galaxies. To investigate the connection between in-plane
star formation and eDIG, we perform a photometric analysis of our narrowband
H$\alpha$ imaging. We measure eDIG scale heights of $h_{z\text{eDIG}} = 0.59
\text{-} 1.39$ kpc and find a positive correlation between them and specific
star formation rates. In all galaxies, we also find a strong correlation
between extraplanar and midplane radial H$\alpha$ profiles. Using our MUSE
data, we investigate the origin of eDIG via kinematics. We find ionized gas
rotation velocity lags above the midplane with values between 10 and 27 km
s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. While we do find hints of an accretion origin for the
ionized gas in ESO 157-49, IC 217, and IC 1553, overall the ionized gas
kinematics of our galaxies do not match a steady galaxy model or any simplistic
model of accretion or internal origin for the gas. We also construct standard
diagnostic diagrams and emission-line maps (EW(H$\alpha$), [NII]/H$\alpha$,
[SII]//H$\alpha$, [OIII]/H$\beta$) and find regions consistent with mixed OB
star and hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) ionization, and mixed OB-shock
ionization. Our results suggest that OB stars are the primary driver of eDIG
ionization, while both HOLMES and shocks may locally contribute to the
ionization of eDIG to a significant degree. Despite our galaxies' similar
structures and masses, we find a surprisingly composite image of ionization
mechanisms and a multifarious origin for the eDIG.

Title:Diffuse flux of PeV neutrinos from centrifugally accelerated protons in active galactic nuclei,"
Abstract:  Evidence for high-energy astrophysical PeV neutrinos has been found in the
IceCube experiment from an analysis with a 7.5 year (2010 - 2017) data. Active
galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most prominent objects in the universe, and
are widely speculated to be emitters of ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays
with proton domination. Based on the standard two-step LLCD mechanism of
particle acceleration, a transformation of energy occurs from AGN's central
super-massive black hole (SMBH) rotation to high-energy protons. Protons can be
accelerated up to $\sim 0.1$ EeV energies and above, and might generate PeV
neutrinos in the energy range $1$--$10$~ PeV through plausible hadronic
interactions. The theoretically estimated revised extragalactic diffuse muon
neutrino flux employing the ""luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE)""
model for the AGN luminosity function (LF) is found consistent with the IceCube
level if only a fraction, $6.56\%$ of the total bolometric luminosity (BL) of
AGN is being realizable to power the PeV neutrinos. In the $\Lambda$~CDM
cosmological framework with the LDDE modeled LF and photon index distribution,
about $5.18\%$ of the total BL is enough to power the IceCube neutrinos.

Title:Observational constraints on nonlinear matter extensions of general relativity,"
Abstract:  We present a phenomenological analysis of current observational constraints
on classes of FLRW cosmological models in which the matter side of Einstein's
equations includes, in addition to the canonical term, a term proportional to
some function of the energy-momentum tensor
($T^2=T_{\alpha\beta}T^{\alpha\beta}=\rho^2+3p^2$), or of its trace
($T=\rho-3p$). Qualitatively, one may think of these models as extensions of
general relativity with a nonlinear matter Lagrangian. As such they are
somewhat different from the usual dynamical dark energy or modified gravity
models: in the former class of models one adds further dynamical degrees of
freedom to the Lagrangian (often in the form of scalar fields), while in the
latter the gravitational part of the Lagrangian is changed. We study both of
these models under two different scenarios: (1) as phenomenological
two-parameter or three-parameter extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM, in
which case the model still has a cosmological constant but the nonlinear matter
Lagrangian leads to additional terms in Einstein's equations, which
cosmological observations tightly constrain, and (2) as alternatives to
$\Lambda$CDM, where there is no cosmological constant, and the nonlinear matter
term would have to provide the acceleration (which would be somewhat closer in
spirit to the usual modified gravity models). A comparative analysis of the
observational constraints obtained in the various cases provides some insight
on the level of robustness of the $\Lambda$ model and on the parameter space
still available for phenomenological alternatives.

Title:Gas distribution from clusters to filaments in IllustrisTNG,"
Abstract:  Matter distribution in the environment of galaxy clusters, from their cores
to their connected cosmic filaments, must be in principle related to the
underlying cluster physics and it evolutionary state. We aim to investigate how
radial and azimuthal distribution of gas is affected by cluster environments,
and how it can be related to cluster mass assembly history. Radial physical
properties of gas (velocity, temperature, and density) is first analysed around
415 galaxy cluster environments from IllustrisTNG simulation at z = 0
(TNG300-1). Whereas hot plasma is virialised inside clusters (< R200), the
dynamics of warm hot inter-galactic medium (WHIM) can be separated in two
regimes: accumulating and slowly infalling gas at cluster peripheries and fast
infalling motions outside clusters (> 1.5R200). The azimuthal distribution of
dark matter (DM), hot and warm gas phases is secondly statistically probed by
decomposing their 2-D distribution in harmonic space. Inside clusters, the
azimuthal symmetries of DM and hot gas are well tracing cluster structural
properties, such as their center offsets, substructure fractions and elliptical
shapes. Beyond cluster virialised regions, we find that WHIM gas follows the
azimuthal distribution of DM thus tracing cosmic filament patterns. Azimuthal
symmetries of hot and warm gas distribution are finally shown to be imprints of
cluster mass assembly history, strongly correlated with the formation time,
mass accretion rate, and dynamical state of clusters. Azimuthal mode
decomposition of 2-D gas distribution is a promising probe to assess the 3-D
physical and dynamical cluster properties up to their connected cosmic
filaments.

Title:Do blue galaxy-clusters have hot intracluster gas?,"
Abstract:  We present herein a systematic X-ray analysis of blue galaxy-clusters at
$z=0.84$ discovered by the Subaru telescope. The sample consisted of 43
clusters identified by combining red-sequence and blue-cloud surveys, covering
a wide range of emitter fractions (i.e., 0.3--0.8). The spatial extent of the
over-density region of emitter galaxies was approximately 1~Mpc in radius. The
average cluster mass was estimated as $0.6 (<1.5)\times10^{14}~{\rm M_\odot}$
from the stacked weak-lensing measurement. We analyzed the XMM-Newton archival
data, and measured the X-ray luminosity of the hot intracluster medium. As a
result, diffuse X-ray emission was marginally detected in 14 clusters, yielding
an average luminosity of $5\times 10^{42}~{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. On the contrary,
it was not significant in 29 clusters. The blue clusters were significantly
fainter than the red-dominated clusters, and the X-ray luminosity did not show
any meaningful correlation either with emitter fraction or richness. The X-ray
surface brightness was low, but the amount of gas mass was estimated to be
comparable to that observed in the $10^{13-14}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ cluster. Based
on the results, we suggest that the blue clusters are at the early formation
stage, and the gas is yet to be compressed and heated up to produce appreciable
X-rays. Follow-up spectroscopic measurements are essential to clarify the
dynamical status and co-evolution of galaxies and hot gas in the blue clusters.

Title:Achieving precision cosmology with gravitational-wave bright sirens from SKA-era pulsar timing arrays,"
Abstract:  Nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) generated by the individual inspiraling
supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the centers of galaxies may be
detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the future. The GW signals from
individual SMBHBs can be employed as standard sirens to measure absolute cosmic
distances, and further provide constraints on cosmological parameters via the
distance--redshift relation. Namely, these SMBHBs with known redshifts can
serve as bright sirens. In this paper, we analyze the ability of SKA-era PTAs
to detect existing SMBHB candidates by means of simulating the timing residuals
of pulsar signals, and use the mock data of SMBHB bright sirens to perform
cosmological parameter estimations. We find that once the root mean square of
timing residuals ($\sigma_t$) could be reduced to 20 ns, about only 100
millisecond pulsars are needed to provide a tight constraint on the Hubble
constant ($H_0$) with the precision close to $1\%$, which meets the criterion
of precision cosmology. We further show that the SMBHB bright sirens can
effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the CMB
data, and thus improve the constraint precision of the equation of state of
dark energy ($w$) to $3.5\%$, which is comparable with the result of Planck
2018 TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+SNe+BAO. We conclude that the bright sirens from
SKA-era PTAs will play an important role in breaking the cosmological parameter
degeneracies and exploring the nature of dark energy.

Abstract:  Platelets corrugated horn is a promising technology for their scalability to
a large corrugated horn array. In this paper, we present the design,
fabrication, measurement and uncertainty analysis of a wideband 170-320 GHz
platelet corrugated horn that features with low sidelobe across the band (<-30
dB). We also propose an accurate and universal method to analyze the axial
misalignment of the platelets for the first time. It is based on the mode
matching (MM) method with a closed-form solution to off-axis circular waveguide
discontinuities obtained by using Graf addition theorem for the Bessel
functions. The uncertainties introduced in the fabrication have been
quantitatively analyzed using the Monte Carlo method. The analysis shows the
cross-polarization of the corrugated horn degrades significantly with the axial
misalignment. It well explains the discrepancy between the designed and the
measured cross-polarization of platelets corrugated horn fabricated in THz
band. The method can be used to determine the fabrication tolerance needed for
other THz corrugated horns and evaluate the impact of the corrugated horn for
astronomical observations.

Title:Single-pulse studies of three millisecond pulsars,"
Abstract:  Single-pulse studies are important to understand the pulsar emission
mechanism and the noise floor in precision timing. We study total intensity and
polarimetry properties of three bright millisecond pulsars - PSRs J1022+1001,
J1713+0747, and B1855+09 - that have detectable single pulses at multiple
frequencies. We report for the first time the detection of single pulses from
PSR J1022+1001 and PSR J1713+0747 at 4.5 GHz. In addition, for those two
pulsars the fraction of linear polarization in the average profile is
significantly reduced at 4.5 GHz, compared to 1.38 GHz, which could support the
expected deviation from a dipolar field closer to the pulsar surface. While the
fraction of linear polarization in single pulses of PSR J1022+1001 also follows
this trend, the few single pulses in our data set of J1713+0747 seem to show a
higher fraction of linear polarization at 4.5 GHz than at 1.38 GHz. We do not
find evidence for orthogonal modes in single pulses for any of the pulsars.
More sensitive multi-frequency observations may be useful to confirm these
findings. The jitter noise contributions at 1.38 GHz, scaled to one hour, for
PSR J1022+1001 and PSR J1713+0747 are ~220 ns and ~41 ns respectively and are
consistent with previous studies, but for B1855+09 the jitter noise is ~86 ns,
which is lower than previously measured. We also show that selective
bright-pulse timing of PSR J1022+1001 yields improved root-mean-square
residuals of ~23 mus, which is a factor of ~4 better than timing using single
pulses alone.

Title:SOFIA/GREAT observations of OD and OH rotational lines towards high-mass star forming regions,"
Abstract:  Only recently, OD, the deuterated isotopolog of hydroxyl, OH, has become
accessible in the interstellar medium; spectral lines from both species have
been observed in the supra-Terahertz and far infrared regime. Here we study
rotational lines of OD and OH towards 13 Galactic high-mass star forming
regions, with the aim to constrain the OD abundance and infer the deuterium
fractionation of OH in their molecular envelopes. We used the Stratospheric
Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to observe the $^2\Pi_{3/2}$
$J=5/2-3/2$ ground-state transition of OD at 1.3 THz ($215~\mu$m) and the
rotationally excited OH line at 1.84 THz ($163~\mu$m). We also used published
high-spectral-resolution SOFIA data of the OH ground-state transition at 2.51
THz ($119.3~\mu$m). Our results show that absorption from the $^2\Pi_{3/2}$ OD
$J=5/2-3/2$ ground-state transition is prevalent in the dense clumps
surrounding active sites of high-mass star formation. We performed detailed
radiative transfer modelling to investigate the OD abundance profile in the
inner envelope for a large fraction of our sample. Our modelling suggests that
part of the absorption arises from the denser inner parts, while the bulk of it
as seen with SOFIA originates in the outer, cold layers of the envelope for
which our constraints on the molecular abundance suggest a strong enhancement
in deuterium fractionation. We find a weak negative correlation between the OD
abundance and the bolometric luminosity to mass ratio, an evolutionary
indicator, suggesting a slow decrease of OD abundance with time. A comparison
with HDO shows a similarly high deuterium fractionation for the two species in
the cold envelopes, which is of the order of 0.48% for the best studied source,
G34.26+0.15. Our results are consistent with chemical models that favour rapid
exchange reactions to form OD in the dense cold gas.

heiioseismology analysis of solar-oscillation data from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) from May 2010 to

scales with the depth, from supergranulation to giant-cell scales, and support
the evidence of large-scale convection, previously detected by tracking the
motion of supergranular cells on the surface. The total power of convective
flows correlates with the solar activity cycle. During the solar maximum, the
total power decreases in shallow subsurface layers and increases in the deeper
layers.

Abstract:  We report the detection of a strong thermal component in the short Gamma-Ray
Burst 170206A with three intense pulses in its light curves, throughout which
the fluxes of this thermal component exhibit fast temporal variability same as
that of the accompanying non-thermal component. The values of the time-resolved
low-energy photon index in the non-thermal component are between about -0.79
and -0.16, most of which are harder than -2/3 excepted in the synchrotron
emission process. In addition, we found a common evolution between the thermal
component and the non-thermal component, $E_{\rm p,CPL} \propto kT_{\rm
BB}^{0.95\pm0.28}$, and $F_{\rm CPL} \propto F_{\rm BB}^{0.67\pm0.18}$, where
$E_{\rm p,CPL}$ and $F_{\rm CPL}$ are the peak photon energy and corresponding
flux of the non-thermal component, and $ kT_{\rm BB}$ and $F_{BB}$ are the
temperature and corresponding flux of the thermal component, respectively.
Finally, we proposed that the photospheric thermal emission and the
Comptonization of thermal photons may be responsible for the observational
features of GRB 170206A.

Abstract:  The evaluation of sky characteristics plays a fundamental role for many
astrophysical experiments and ground-based observations. In solar physics, the
main requirement for such observations is a very low sky brightness value, that
is, less than one-millionth of the solar disk brightness. Few places match such
requirement for ground-based, out-of-eclipse coronagraphic measurements. A

conditions, the sky brightness of Dome C has reached values of the order of 1.0
to 0.7 millionth of of the solar disk brightness.

Title:Multi-instrument STIX microflare study,"
Abstract:  During its commissioning phase in 2020, the Spectrometer/Telescope for
Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board the Solar Orbiter spacecraft observed 69
microflares. The two most significant events from this set (of GOES class B2
and B6) were observed on-disk from the spacecraft as well as from Earth and
analysed in terms of the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics.
We complement the observations from the STIX instrument with EUV imagery from
SDO/AIA and GOES soft X-ray data by adding imaging and plasma diagnostics over
different temperature ranges for a detailed microflare case study that is
focussed on energy release and transport.
Spectral fitting of the STIX data shows clear nonthermal emission for both
microflares studied here. The deduced plasma parameters from DEM reconstruction
as well as spectral fitting roughly agree with the values in the literature for
microflares as do the nonthermal fit parameters from STIX. The observed Neupert
effects and impulsive and gradual phases indicate that both events covered in
this study are consistent with the standard chromospheric evaporation flare
scenario. For the B6 event on 7 June 2020, this interpretation is further
supported by the temporal evolution seen in the DEM profiles of the flare
ribbons and loops. For this event, we also find that accelerated electrons can
roughly account for the required thermal energy. The 6 June 2020 event
demonstrates that STIX can detect nonthermal emission for GOES class B2 events
that is nonetheless smaller than the background rate level. We demonstrate for
the first time how detailed multi-instrument studies of solar flares can be
performed with STIX.

Title:Current Challenges in Cepheid Distance Calibrations Using Gaia EDR3,"
Abstract:  Using parallaxes from Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), we determine
multi-wavelength BVI, JHK, and [3.6] & [4.5] micron absolute magnitudes for 37
nearby Milky Way Cepheids, covering the period range between 5 and 60 days. We
apply these period-luminosity relations to Cepheids in the Large and Small
Magellanic Clouds, and find that the derived distances are significantly
discrepant with the geometric distances according to detached eclipsing
binaries (DEBs). We explore several potential causes of these issues, including
reddening, metallicity, and the existence of an additional zero-point offset,
but none provide a sufficient reconciliation with both DEB distances. We
conclude that the combination of the systematic uncertainties on the EDR3
parallaxes with the uncertainties on the effect of metallicity on the Cepheid
distance scale leads to a systematic error floor of approximately 3%. We
therefore find that the EDR3 data is not sufficiently accurate in the regime of
these bright Cepheids to determine extragalactic distances precise to the 1%
level at this time, in agreement with a number of contemporary studies.

Abstract:  Kinematic lensing (KL) is a new cosmological measurement technique that
combines traditional weak lensing (WL) shape measurements of disc galaxies with
their kinematic information. Using the Tully-Fisher relation KL breaks the
degeneracy between intrinsic and observed ellipticity and significantly reduces
the impact of multiple systematics that are present in traditional WL. We
explore the performance of KL given the instrument capabilities of the
$\textit{Roman Space Telescope}$, assuming overlap of the High Latitude Imaging
Survey (HLIS), the High Latitude Spectroscopy Survey (HLSS) over 2,000 deg$^2$.
Our KL suitable galaxy sample has a number density of
$n_{\mathrm{gal}}=4~\mathrm{arcmin}^{-1}$ with an estimated shape noise level
of $\sigma_{\epsilon}=0.035$. We quantify the cosmological constraining power
on $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$-$S_8$, $w_p$-$w_a$ by running simulated likelihood
analyses that account for redshift and shear calibration uncertainties,
intrinsic alignment and baryonic feedback. Compared to a traditional WL survey
we find that KL significantly improves the constraining power on
$\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$-$S_8$ (FoM$_{\mathrm{KL}}$=1.70FoM$_{\mathrm{WL}}$) and
$w_p$-$w_a$ (FoM$_{\mathrm{KL}}$=3.65FoM$_{\mathrm{WL}}$). We also explore a
""narrow tomography KL survey"" using 30 instead of the default 10 tomographic
bins, however we find no meaningful enhancement to the FoM even when assuming a
significant time-dependence in our fiducial dark energy input scenarios.

Title:Improving the diameters of interferometric calibrators with MATISSE,"
Abstract:  A good knowledge of the angular diameters of stars used to calibrate the
observables in stellar interferometry is fundamental. As the available
precision for giant stars is worse than the required per cent level, we aim to
improve the knowledge of many diameters using MATISSE (Multiple AperTure
mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment) data in its different instrumental
configurations. Using the squared visibility MATISSE observable, we compute the
angular diameter value, which ensures the best-fitting curves, assuming an
intensity distribution of a uniform disc. We take into account that the
transfer function varies over the wavelength and is different from one
instrumental configuration to another. The uncertainties on the diameters are
estimated using the residual bootstrap method. Using the low spectral
resolution mode in the L band, we observed a set of 35 potential calibrators
selected in the Mid-infrared stellar Diameter and Flux Compilation Catalogue
with diameters ranging from about 1 to 3 mas. We reach a precision on the
diameter estimates in the range 0.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent. The study of the
stability of the transfer function in visibility over two nights makes us
confident in our results. In addition, we identify one star, 75 Vir initially
present in the calibrator lists, for which our method does not converge, and
prove to be a binary star. This leads us to the conclusion that our method is
actually necessary to improve the quality of the astrophysical results obtained
with MATISSE, and that it can be used as a useful tool for 'bad calibrator'
detection.

Abstract:  Cosmic microwave background radiation can supply us some most significant
parts of the information on the universe. Some researchers believe that The
gravitational system cannot be decribed by the standard statistical mechanics.
In this article we apply Tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics to
investigate CMB spectrum and related cosmological processes. Based on recent
observational data we find that the nonextensive statistical mechanics can
modify the values of related physical quantites. Since the value of physical
quantites have changed, some processes, such as recombination, can be affected.
We have investigated the anisotropy of the CMB for two effects: the dipole
anisotropy of CMB and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. We find that the dipole
anisotropy of CMB cannot be modified by the nonextensive statistical mechanics.
However, the standard result of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect should be
modified by nonextensive statistical mechanics. In principle, future work can
distinguish these effects.

the LPVs in NGC 2366 and IC 2574 are similar. While the period distribution of
LPVs in Ho II is uncertain due to small number statistics there appears to be a
deficiency of LPVs with periods between 550 and 650 days when compared with NGC
2366 and IC 2574. The LPVs are diffusely distributed on the sky, and do not
follow the underlying light from unresolved stars, as expected if episodes of
star formation within the past few hundred Myr have occurred throughout the
galaxies, including their outer regions. Distances computed for Ho II and NGC
2366 from the period-luminosity relations (PLRs) agree to within ~0.1
magnitudes with those based on the tip of the red giant branch (RGB). Efforts
to estimate an LPV-based distance modulus for IC 2574 are complicated by the
presence of first overtone pulsators among LPVs with periods ~ 600 days,
although the PLR at the long period end is consistent with the distance
estimated from the RGB-tip. In addition to the LPVs, 10 candidate sgB[e] or

spectroscopy and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy). This paper presents the
NIR measurements and interpretations acquired with the ExoMars MicrOmega spare
instrument. MicrOmega is a NIR hyperspectral microscope, mounted in the
analytical laboratory of the ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin. All PTAL samples
have been observed at least once with MicrOmega using a dedicated setup. For
all PTAL samples data description and interpretation are presented. For some
chosen examples, RGB images and spectra are presented a well. A comparison with
characterizations by NIR and Raman spectrometry is discussed for some of the
samples. In particular, the spectral imaging capacity of MicrOmega allows
detections of mineral components and potential organic molecules that were not
possible with other one-spot techniques. Additionally, it enables to estimate
heterogeneities in the spatial distribution of various mineral species. The

Title:Viscous dissipation in the fluid core of the Moon,"
Abstract:  The spin axes of the mantle, fluid core and solid inner core of the Moon
precess at frequency $\Omega_p=2\pi/18.6$ yr$^{-1}$ though with different
orientations, leading to viscous friction at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and
inner core boundary (ICB). Here, we use a rotational model of the Moon with a
range of inner core and outer core radii to investigate the relative importance
of viscous dissipation at the CMB and ICB, and to show how this dissipation is
connected to the phase lead angle ($\phi_p$) of the mantle ahead of its Cassini
state. We show that when the inner core radius is $>80$ km and the free inner
core nutation frequency $\Omega_{ficn}$ approaches $\Omega_p$, viscous
dissipation at the ICB can be comparable to that at the CMB, and in the most
extreme cases exceed it by as much as a factor 10. If so, the viscous
dissipation in the lunar core projected back in time depends on how
$\Omega_{ficn}$ has evolved relative to $\Omega_p$. We further show that
constraints on the CMB and ICB radii of the lunar core can in principle be
extracted by matching the observed phase lead of $\phi_p=0.27$ arcsec; this
requires an improved estimate of tidal dissipation and an accurate model of the
turbulent viscous torque. Lastly, when our rotational model is constrained to
match $\phi_p=0.27$ arcsec, our results suggest that the viscous dissipation at
the ICB is likely insufficient to have ever been above the threshold to power a

Title:The accretion process in the DQ Tau binary system,"
Abstract:  Mass accretion from the circumstellar disk onto the protostar is a
fundamental process during star formation. Measuring the mass accretion rate is
particularly challenging for stars belonging to binary systems, because it is
often difficult to discriminate which component is accreting. DQ~Tau is an
almost equal-mass spectroscopic binary system where the components orbit each
other every 15.8~days. The system is known to display pulsed accretion, i.e.,
the periodic modulation of the accretion by the components on eccentric orbit.
We present multiepoch ESO/VLT X-Shooter observations of DQ~Tau, with the aim to
determine which component of this system is the main accreting source. We use
the absorption lines in the spectra to determine the radial velocity of the two
components, and measure the continuum veiling as a function of wavelength and
time. We fit the observed spectra with non-accreting templates to correct for
the photospheric and chromospheric contribution. In the corrected spectra we
study in details the profiles of the emission lines and calculate mass
accretion rates for the system as a function of orbital phase. In accordance
with previous findings, we detect elevated accretion close to periastron. We
measure that the accretion rate varies between $10^{-8.5}$ and $10^{-7.3}$
Msun/yr. The emission line profiles suggest that both stars are actively
accreting and the dominant accretor is not always the same component, varying
in few orbits.

Title:Viscoelastic relaxation within the Moon and the phase lead of its Cassini state,"
Abstract:  Analyses of Lunar Laser Ranging data show that the spin-symmetry axis of the
Moon is ahead of its expected Cassini state by an angle of $\phi_p$ = 0.27
arcsec. This indicates the presence of one or more dissipation mechanisms
acting on the lunar rotation. A combination of solid-body tides and viscous
core-mantle coupling have been proposed in previous studies. Here, we
investigate whether viscoelastic deformation within a solid inner core at the
centre of the Moon can also account for a part of the observed phase lead angle
$\phi_p$. We build a rotational dynamic model of the Cassini state of the Moon
that comprises an inner core, a fluid core and a mantle, and where solid
regions are allowed to deform viscoelastically in response to an applied
forcing. We show that the presence of an inner core does not change the global
monthly Q of the Moon and hence, that the contribution from solid-body tides to
$\phi_p$ is largely unaffected by an inner core. However, we also show that
viscoelastic deformation within the inner core, acting to realign its figure
axis with that of the mantle, can contribute significantly to $\phi_p$ through
inner core-mantle gravitational coupling. We show that the contribution to
$\phi_p$ is largest when the inner core viscosity is in the range of $10^{13}$
to $10^{14}$ Pa s, when the inner core radius is large and when the free inner
core nutation frequency approaches a resonance with the precession frequency of
$2\pi/18.6$ yr$^{-1}$.

Title:Development of a cosmic ray oriented trigger for the fluorescence telescope on EUSO-SPB2,"
Abstract:  The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2
(EUSO-SPB2), in preparation, aims to make the first observations of Ultra-High
Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) from near space using optical techniques. EUSO-SPB2
will prototype instrumentation for future satellite-based missions, including
the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) and K-EUSO. The
payload will consist of two telescopes. The first is a Cherenkov telescope (CT)
being developed to quantify the background for future below-the-limb very high
energy (E>10 PeV) astrophysical neutrino observations, and the second is a
fluorescence telescope (FT) being developed for detection of UHECRs. The FT
will consist of a Schmidt telescope, and a 6192 pixel ultraviolet camera with
an integration time of 1.05 microseconds. The first step in the data
acquisition process for the FT is a hardware level trigger in order to decide
which data to record. In order to maximize the number of UHECR induced
extensive air showers (EASs) which can be detected, a novel trigger algorithm
has been developed based on the intricacies and limitations of the detector.
The expected performance of the trigger has been characterized by simulations
and, pending hardware verification, shows that EUSO-SPB2 is well positioned to
attempt the first near-space observation of UHECRs via optical techniques.

Title:A past lunar dynamo thermally driven by the precession of its inner core,"
Abstract:  The Cassini state equilibrium associated with the precession of the Moon
predicts that the mantle, fluid core and solid inner core precess at different
angles. We present estimates of the dissipation from viscous friction
associated with the differential precession at the core-mantle boundary (CMB),
$Q_{cmb}$, and at the inner core boundary (ICB), $Q_{icb}$, as a function of
the evolving lunar orbit. We focus on the latter and show that, provided the
inner core was larger than 100 km, $Q_{icb}$ may have been as high as
$10^{10}-10^{11}$ W for most of the lunar history for a broad range of core
density models. This is larger than the power required to maintain the fluid
core in an adiabatic state, therefore the heat released by the differential
precession at the ICB can drive a past lunar dynamo by thermal convection. This
dynamo can outlive the dynamo from precession at the CMB and may have shutoff
only relatively recently. Estimates of the magnetic field strength at the lunar
surface are of the order of a few $\mu$T, compatible with the lunar
paleomagnetic intensities recorded after 3 Ga. We further show that it is
possible that a transition of the Cassini state associated with the inner core
may have occurred as a result of the evolution of the lunar orbit. The heat
flux associated with $Q_{icb}$ can be of the order of a few mW m$^{-2}$, which
should slow down inner core growth and be included in thermal evolution models
of the lunar core.

Title:The Cassini State of the Moon's inner core,"
Abstract:  We present a model of the precession dynamics of the Moon that comprises a
fluid outer core and a solid inner core. We show that three Cassini states
associated with the inner core exist. The tilt angle of the inner core in each
of these states is determined by the ratio between the free inner core nutation
frequency ($\omega_{ficn}$) and the precession frequency $\Omega_p = 2\pi/18.6$
yr $^{-1}$. All three Cassini states are possible if $|\omega_{ficn}| >
2\pi/16.4$ yr $^{-1}$, but only one is possible otherwise. Assuming that the
lowest energy state is favoured, this transition marks a discontinuity in the
tilt angle of the inner core, transiting from $-33^\circ$ to $17^\circ$ as
measured with respect to the mantle figure axis, where negative angles indicate
a tilt towards the orbit normal. Possible Lunar interior density structures
cover a range of $\omega_{ficn}$, from approximately half to twice as large as
$\Omega_p$, so the precise tilt angle of the inner core remains unknown, though
it is likely large because $\Omega_p$ is within the resonant band of
$\omega_{ficn}$. Adopting one specific density model, we suggest an inner core
tilt of approximately $-17^\circ$. Viscoelastic deformations within the inner
core and melt and growth at the surface of a tilted inner core, both neglected
in our model, should reduce this amplitude. If the inner core is larger than
approximately 200 km, it may contribute by as much as a few thousandths of a
degree on the observed mantle precession angle of $1.543^\circ$.

Title:Are the Newly-Discovered $z \sim 13$ Drop-out Sources Starburst Galaxies or Quasars?,"
Abstract:  The detection of two $z\sim 13$ galaxy candidates has opened a new window on
galaxy formation at an era only $330$ Myr after the Big Bang. Here, we
investigate the physical nature of these sources: are we witnessing star
forming galaxies or quasars at such early epochs? If powered by star formation,
the observed ultraviolet (UV) luminosities and number densities can be jointly
explained if: (i) these galaxies are extreme star-formers with star formation
rates $5-24\times$ higher than those expected from extrapolations of average
lower-redshift relations; (ii) the star formation efficiency increases with
halo mass and is countered by increasing dust attenuation from $z \sim 10-5$;
(iii) they form stars with an extremely top-heavy initial mass function. The
quasar hypothesis is also plausible, with the UV luminosity produced by black
holes of $\sim 10^8 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ accreting at or slightly above the
Eddington rate ($f_{\rm Edd}\sim 1.0$). This black hole mass at $z\sim13$ would
require very challenging, but not implausible, growth parameters. If
spectroscopically confirmed, these two sources will represent a remarkable
laboratory to study the Universe at previously inaccessible redshifts.

Title:Mapping the Surface of Partially Cloudy Exoplanets is Hard,"
Abstract:  Reflected light photometry of terrestrial exoplanets could reveal the
presence of oceans and continents, hence placing direct constraints on the
current and long-term habitability of these worlds. Inferring the albedo map of
a planet from its observed light curve is challenging because different maps
may yield indistinguishable light curves. This degeneracy is aggravated by
changing clouds. It has previously been suggested that disk-integrated
photometry spanning multiple days could be combined to obtain a cloud-free
surface map of an exoplanet. We demonstrate this technique as part of a
Bayesian retrieval by simultaneously fitting for the fixed surface map of a
planet and the time-variable overlying clouds. We test this approach on
synthetic data then apply it to real disk-integrated observations of the Earth.
We find that eight days of continuous synthetic observations are sufficient to
reconstruct a faithful low resolution surface albedo map, without needing to
make assumptions about cloud physics. For lightcurves with negligible
photometric uncertainties, the minimal top-of-atmosphere albedo at a location
is a good estimate of its surface albedo. When applied to observations from the
Earth Polychromating Imaging Camera aboard the DSCOVR spacecraft, our approach
removes only a small fraction of clouds. We attribute this difficulty to the
full-phase geometry of observations combined with the short correlation length
for Earth clouds. For exoplanets with Earth-like climatology, it may be hard to
do much better than a cloud-averaged map. We surmise that cloud removal will be
most successful for exoplanets imaged near quarter phase that harbour large
cloud systems.

Title:The Evolution of Brightest Cluster Galaxies in the Nearby Universe II: The star-formation activity and the Stellar Mass from Spectral Energy Distribution,"
Abstract:  We study the star-formation activity in a sample of $\sim$ 56,000 brightest
cluster galaxies (BCGs) at $0.05 < z < 0.42$ using optical and infra-red data
from SDSS and WISE. We estimate stellar masses and star-formation rates (SFR)
through SED fitting and study the evolution of the SFR with redshift as well as
the effects of BCG stellar mass, cluster halo mass and cooling time on star
formation. Our BCGs have $SFR = 1.4\times10^{-3}-275.2$ [$\rm M_{\odot}$/yr]
and $sSFR=5 \times 10^{-15}-6 \times 10^{-10}$ [yr$^{-1}$] . We find that
star-forming BCGs are more abundant at higher redshifts and have higher $SFR$
than at lower redshifts. The fraction of star-forming BCGs ($f_{\rm SF}$)
varies from 30% to 80% at $0.05 < z < 0.42$. Despite the large values of
$f_{\rm SF}$, we show that only 13% of the BCGs lie on the star-forming main
sequence for field galaxies at the same redshifts. We also find that $f_{\rm
SF}$ depends only weakly on $\rm M_{200}$, while it sharply decreases with $\rm
M_{*}$. We finally find that the $SFR$ in BCGs decreases with increasing $\rm
t_{cool}$, suggesting that star formation is related to the cooling of the
intra-cluster medium. However, we also find a weak correlation of $\rm M_{*}$
and $\rm M_{200}$ with $\rm t_{cool}$, suggesting that AGN are heating the
intra-cluster gas around the BCGs. We compare our estimates of $SFR$ with the
predictions from empirical models for the evolution of the $SFR$ with redshift,
finding that the transition from a merger dominated to a cooling-dominated star
formation may happen at $z < 0.6$.

Title:Towards RNA life on Early Earth: From atmospheric HCN to biomolecule production in warm little ponds,"
Abstract:  The origin of life on Earth involves the early appearance of an
information-containing molecule such as RNA. The basic building blocks of RNA
could have been delivered by carbon-rich meteorites, or produced in situ by
processes beginning with the synthesis of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in the early
Earth's atmosphere. Here, we construct a robust physical and non-equilibrium
chemical model of the early Earth atmosphere. The atmosphere is supplied with
hydrogen from impact degassing of meteorites, sourced with water evaporated
from the oceans, carbon dioxide from volcanoes, and methane from undersea
hydrothermal vents, and in which lightning and external UV-driven chemistry
produce HCN. This allows us to calculate the rain-out of HCN into warm little
ponds (WLPs). We then use a comprehensive sources and sinks numerical model to
compute the resulting abundances of nucleobases, ribose, and nucleotide
precursors such as 2-aminooxazole resulting from aqueous and UV-driven
chemistry within them. We find that at 4.4 bya (billion years ago) the limits
of adenine concentrations in ponds for habitable surfaces is 0.05$\mu$M in the
absence of seepage. These concentrations can be maintained for over 100 Myr.
Meteorite delivery of adenine to WLPs can provide boosts in concentration by
2-3 orders of magnitude, but these boosts deplete within months by UV
photodissociation, seepage, and hydrolysis. The early evolution of the
atmosphere is dominated by the decrease of hydrogen due to falling impact rates
and atmospheric escape, and the rise of oxygenated species such as OH from H2O
photolysis. Our work points to an early origin of RNA on Earth within ~200 Myr
of the Moon-forming impact.

Title:Astrometric excess noise in Gaia EDR3 and the search for X-ray binaries,"
Abstract:  Astrometric noise (AEN) in excess of parallax and proper motion is a
potential signature of orbital wobble of individual components in binary star
systems. The combination of X-ray selection with astrometric noise could then
be a powerful tool for robustly isolating accreting binaries in large surveys.
Here, we mine the Gaia EDR3 catalogue for Galactic sources with significant
values of astrometric noise over the parameter space expected for known and
candidate X-ray binaries (XRBs). Cross-matching our sample with the Chandra
Source Catalogue returns a primary sample of ~6,500 X-ray sources with
significant AEN. X-ray detection efficiency for objects with significant AEN is
a factor of ~4.5 times higher than in a matched control sample exhibiting low
AEN. The primary sample branches off the main sequence much more than control
objects in colour-mag space, and includes a higher fraction of known binaries,
variables and young stellar object class types. However, values of AEN reported
in the Gaia pipeline releases so far can exceed expectations for individual
XRBs with known semi-major axis size and other system parameters. It is likely
that other factors (possibly attitude and modelling uncertainties, as well as
source variability) currently dominate the observed excess noise in such
systems. Confirmation of their nature must therefore await future Gaia
releases. The full X-ray matched catalogue is released here to enable legacy
follow-up.

Abstract:  Dark matter (DM) is predicted to be the dominant mass component in galaxies.
In the central region of Early-type galaxies it is expected to account for a

Mass Function (IMF). We discuss latest results on the DM fraction and mean DM
density for local galaxies and explore their evolution with redshifts in the
last 8 Gyr of the cosmic history. We compare these results with expectations
from the $\Lambda$CDM model, and discuss the the role of the IMF and galaxy
model, through the central total mass density slope. We finally present future
perspectives offered by next generation instruments/surveys (Rubin/LSST,
Euclid, CSST, WEAVE, 4MOST, DESI), that will provide the unique chance to
measure the DM evolution with time for an unprecedented number of galaxies and

"Title:GASP XXXVII: The Most Extreme Jellyfish Galaxies Compared to Other Disk Galaxies in Clusters, an HI Study","
Abstract:  We present the results of a VLA HI imaging survey aimed at understanding why
some galaxies develop long extraplanar H$\alpha$ tails, becoming extreme
jellyfish galaxies. The observations are centered on five extreme jellyfish
galaxies, optically selected from the WINGS and OmegaWINGS surveys and
confirmed to have long H$\alpha$ tails through MUSE observations. Each galaxy
is located in a different cluster. In the observations there are in total 88
other spiral galaxies within the field of view (40'x40') and observed bandwidth
(6500 km s$^{-1}$). We detect 13 of these 88 spirals, plus one uncatalogued
spiral, with HI masses ranging from 1 to 7 $\times$ 10${^9}$ M$_{\odot}$. Many
of these detections have extended HI disks, two show direct evidence for ram
pressure stripping, while others are possibly affected by tidal forces and/or
ram-pressure stripping. We stack the 75 non-detected spiral galaxies and find
an average HI mass of 1.9 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$, which given their
average stellar mass, implies they are very HI deficient. Comparing the extreme
jellyfish galaxies to the other disk galaxies, we find that they have a larger
stellar mass than almost all disk galaxies and than all HI detected galaxies,
they are at smaller projected distance from the cluster center and at higher
relative velocity to the cluster mean than all HI detections and most
non-detections. We conclude that the high stellar mass allows extreme jellyfish
galaxies to fall deeply into the cluster before being stripped and the
surrounding ICM pressure gives rise to their spectacular star-forming tails.

"Title:Binary AGN simulations with radiation pressure reveal a new duty cycle, and a reduction of gravitational torque, through 'minitori' structures","
Abstract:  We produce the first set of radiation hydrodynamics simulations of binary
AGNs at parsec-scale separation in scale-model simulations. We use SPH for
hydrodynamics, and raytracing to calculate optical depths and radiation
pressure from the two AGNs. We confirm that, without radiation pressure, the
sign of gravitational torque is sensitive to the binary parameters, although in
one of our two orbital configurations the binary should coalesce in a
time-scale of $<10^9$ yr. However, radiation pressure quickly destroys the
'minitori' around each SMBH, drastically reducing gravitational torques and
accretion, and greatly increasing the coalescence time-scale. Our simulations
suggest a new 'minitorus' duty cycle with a time-scale of ~10 binary periods
(~$10^6$ yr when scaling our models to a total binary mass of
$2\times10^7\,M_\odot$). The growth and blow-out phases of the 'minitori' are
of similar time-scales, and thus we expect about half of observed binary SMBHs
to be active, in at least one component. The 'minitorus' structure provides
asymmetries that could be observed by infrared interferometry.

Title:Thermal Processing of Solids Encountering a Young Jovian Core,"
Abstract:  Jupiter's enhancement in nitrogen relative to hydrogen when compared to the
Sun has been interpreted as evidence that its early formation occurred beyond
the N$_{2}$ snowline ($\sim$ 20-40 AU). However, the rapid growth necessary to
form Jupiter before the dissipation of the solar nebula would lead to the
forming planet's core reaching very high temperatures ($>$1000 K), which would
lead to it warming its surroundings. Here, we explore the effects of a luminous
planetary core on the solids that it ultimately accretes. We find that a
critical transition occurs where very hot (rapidly accreting) cores drive off
volatiles prior to accretion, while cool cores (slowly accreting) are able to
inherit volatile rich solids. Given Jupiter's nitrogen enrichment, if it formed
beyond the N$_{2}$ snowline, its core could not have accreted solids at a rate
above 10$^{-10}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our results suggest that either Jupiter
formed in more distal regions of the solar nebula, or nitrogen loss was
suppressed, either by its incorporation in more refractory carriers or because
it was trapped within ices which devolatilized at higher temperatures.

Title:Thermonuclear and Electron-Capture Supernovae from Stripped-Envelope Stars,"
Abstract:  (abridged) When stripped from their hydrogen-rich envelopes, stars with
initial masses between $\sim$7 and 11 M$_\odot$ develop massive degenerate
cores and collapse. Depending on the final structure and composition, the
outcome can range from a thermonuclear explosion, to the formation of a neutron
star in an electron-capture supernova (ECSN). It has been recently demonstrated
that stars in this mass range may initiate explosive oxygen burning when their
central densities are still below $\rho_{\rm c} \lesssim 10^{9.6}$ g cm$^{-3}$.
This makes them interesting candidates for type Ia supernovae -- which we call
(C)ONe SNe Ia -- and might have broader implications for the formation of
neutron stars via ECSNe. Here, we model the evolution of 252 helium stars with
initial masses in the $0.8-3.5$ M$_\odot$ range, and metallicities between
$Z=10^{-4}$ and $0.02$. We use these models to constrain the central densities,
compositions and envelope masses at the time of explosive oxygen ignition. We
further investigate the sensitivity of these properties to mass loss rate
assumptions using additional models with varying wind efficiencies. We find
that helium stars with masses between $\sim$1.8 and 2.7 M$_\odot$ evolve onto
$1.35-1.37$ M$_\odot$ (C)ONe cores that initiate explosive burning at central
densities between $\rm \log_{10}(\rho_c)\sim 9.3$ and 9.6. We constrain the
amount of residual carbon retained after core carbon burning, and conclude that
it plays a critical role in determining the final outcome: Chandrasekhar-mass
degenerate cores that retain more than $\sim 0.005$ M$_\odot$ of carbon result
in (C)ONe SNe Ia, while those with lower carbon mass become ECSNe. We find that
(C)ONe SNe Ia are more likely to occur at high metallicities, whereas at low
metallicities ECSNe dominate.

Title:Collisional effects in the blue wing of the Balmer-alpha line,"
Abstract:  In order to investigate the near wing of the Lyman-alpha line, accurate line
profile calculations and molecular data are both required due to the existence
of a close line satellite responsible for its asymmetrical shape. Lyman-alpha
lines observed with the Cosmic Origin Spectograph (COS) on the Hubble Space
Telescope ( HST) show this peculiarity in the spectra of DBA and DA white dwarf
stars. A similar asymmetrical shape in the blue wing can be predicted in the
Balmer-alpha line of H perturbed by He and H atoms. In continuation with a very
recent work on the Lyman-alpha line, where the n=2 potential energies and
transition dipole moments from the ground state were determined, we present new
accurate H-He potential energies and electronic transition dipole moments
involving the molecular states correlated with H(n=3)+He and their transition
dipole moments with the states correlated with H(n=2)+He. Those new data and
existing molecular data for H(n=2,3)-H are used to provide a theoretical
investigation of the collisional effects in the blue wing of the Balmer-alpha
line of H perturbed by He and H atoms. We note the consequences for the
Balmer-alpha line shape in the physical conditions found in the cool atmosphere
of DZA white dwarfs where helium densities may be as high as 10^21 cm-3. This
study is undertaken with a unified theory of spectral line broadening valid at
very high helium densities.

Abstract:  We analyze the first giant molecular cloud (GMC) simulation to follow the
formation of individual stars and their feedback from jets, radiation, winds,
and supernovae, using the STARFORGE framework in the GIZMO code. We evolve the
GMC for $\sim 9 \rm Myr$, from initial turbulent collapse to dispersal by
feedback. Protostellar jets dominate feedback momentum initially, but radiation
and winds cause cloud disruption at $\sim 8\%$ star formation efficiency (SFE),
and the first supernova at $8.3 \rm Myr$ comes too late to influence star
formation significantly. The per-freefall SFE is dynamic, accelerating from 0
to $\sim 18\%$ before dropping quickly to <1%, but the estimate from YSO counts
compresses it to a narrower range. The primary cluster forms hierarchically and
condenses to a brief ($\sim 1\,\mathrm{Myr}$) compact ($\sim 1 \rm pc$) phase,
but does not virialize before the cloud disperses, and the stars end as an
unbound expanding association. The initial mass function resembles the Chabrier
(2005) form with a high-mass slope $\alpha=-2$ and a maximum mass of $55
M_\odot$. Stellar accretion takes $\sim 400 \rm kyr$ on average, but $\gtrsim
1\rm Myr$ for $>10 M_\odot$ stars, so massive stars finish growing latest. The
fraction of stars in multiples increases as a function of primary mass, as
observed. Overall, the simulation much more closely resembles reality, compared
to variations which neglect different feedback physics entirely. But more
detailed comparison with synthetic observations is necessary to constrain the
theoretical uncertainties.

K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni) are derived for a sample of M-dwarfs using
high-resolution near-infrared $H$-band spectra from the SDSS-IV/APOGEE survey.
The quantitative analysis included synthetic spectra computed with 1-D LTE
plane-parallel MARCS models using the APOGEE DR17 line list to determine
chemical abundances. The sample consists of eleven M-dwarfs in binary systems
with warmer FGK-dwarf primaries and ten measured interferometric angular
diameters. To minimize atomic diffusion effects, [X/Fe] ratios are used to
compare M-dwarfs in binary systems and literature results for their warmer
primary stars, indicating good agreement ($<$0.08 dex) for all studied
elements. The mean abundance differences in Primaries-this work M-dwarfs is
-0.05$\pm$0.03 dex. It indicates that M-dwarfs in binary systems are a reliable
way to calibrate empirical relationships. A comparison with abundance,
effective temperature, and surface gravity results from the ASPCAP pipeline
(DR16) finds a systematic offset of [M/H], $T_{\rm eff}$, log$g$ = +0.21 dex,
-50 K, and 0.30 dex, respectively, although ASPCAP [X/Fe] ratios are generally
consistent with this study. The metallicities of the M dwarfs cover the range
of [Fe/H] = -0.9 to +0.4 and are used to investigate Galactic chemical
evolution via trends of [X/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H]. The behavior of the
various elemental abundances [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] agrees well with the
corresponding trends derived from warmer FGK-dwarfs, demonstrating that the
APOGEE spectra can be used to Galactic chemical evolution using large samples
of selected M-dwarfs.

study the possibility that different coexisting plasmas in the nebula emit
them. Expansion velocities of [O III] and O II are equal within uncertainties
in three PNe, providing no evidence for these lines being emitted in different
zones. Exception are Hu 2-1 and Vy 2-2, where ORLs might be emitted in
different zones than CELs. For Vy 2-2 and IC 4997 we found that nebular and
auroral lines of the same ion (S$^+$, N$^{+}$, Ar$^{+2}$, Ar$^{+3}$, O$^{+2}$)
might present different expansion velocities. Auroral lines show lower
$\rm{V_{exp}}$ which might indicate that they are emitted in a denser and inner
zone than the nebular ones.

Title:The Breakthrough Listen Search for Intelligent Life: Technosignature Search of Transiting TESS Targets of Interest,"
Abstract:  The Breakthrough Listen Initiative, as part of its larger mission, is
performing the most thorough technosignature search of nearby stars.
Additionally, Breakthrough Listen is collaborating with scientists working on
NASAs Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), to examine TESS Targets of
Interest (TOIs) for technosignatures. Here, we present a $1-11$ $\textrm{GHz}$
radio technosignature search of $61$ TESS TOIs that were in transit during
their Breakthrough Listen observation at the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank
Telescope. We performed a narrowband Doppler drift search with a minimum S/N
threshold of $10$, across a drift rate range of $\pm 4$ $\textrm{Hz}$
$\textrm{s}$ $^{-1}$, with a resolution of $3$ $\textrm{Hz}$. We removed radio
frequency interference by comparing signals across cadences of target sources.
After interference removal, there are no remaining events in our survey, and
therefore no technosignature signals-of-interest detected in this work. This
null result implies that at L, S, C, and X bands, fewer than $52\textrm{%}$,
$20\textrm{%}$, $16\textrm{%}$, and $15\textrm{%}$, respectively, of TESS TOIs
possess a transmitter with an equivalent isotropic radiated power greater than
a few times $10^{14}$ $\textrm{W}$.

Title:Reevaluation of the cosmic antideuteron flux from cosmic-ray interactions and from exotic sources,"
Abstract:  Cosmic-ray antideuterons could be a key for the discovery of exotic phenomena
in our Galaxy, such as dark-matter annihilations or primordial black hole
evaporation. Unfortunately the theoretical predictions of the antideuteron flux
at Earth are plagued with uncertainties from the mechanism of antideuteron
production and propagation in the Galaxy. We present the most up-to-date
calculation of the antideuteron fluxes from cosmic-ray collisions with the
interstellar medium and from exotic processes. We include for the first time
the antideuteron inelastic interaction cross section recently measured by the
ALICE collaboration to account for the loss of antideuterons during
propagation. In order to bracket the uncertainty in the expected fluxes, we
consider several state-of-the-art models of antideuteron production and of
cosmic-ray propagation.

Title:Detection of HC18O+ in a protoplanetary disk: exploring oxygen isotope fractionation of CO,"
Abstract:  The oxygen isotope fractionation scenario, which has been developed to
explain the oxygen isotope anomaly in the solar system materials, predicts that
CO gas is depleted in 18O in protoplanetary disks, where segregation between
solids and gas inside disks had already occurred. Based on ALMA observations,
we report the first detection of HC18O+(4-3) in a Class II protoplanetary disk
(TW Hya). This detection allows us to explore the oxygen isotope fractionation
of CO in the TW Hya disk from optically thin HCO+ isotopologues as a proxy of
optically thicker CO isotopologues. Using the H13CO+(4-3) data previously
obtained with SMA, we find that the H13CO+/HC18O+ ratio in the central <100 au
regions of the disk is 10.3 +- 3.2. We construct a chemical model of the TW Hya
disk with carbon and oxygen isotope fractionation chemistry, and estimate the
conversion factor from H13CO+/HC18O+ to 13CO/C18O. With the conversion factor
(= 0.8), the 13CO/C18O ratio is estimated to be 8.3 +- 2.6, which is consistent
with the elemental abundance ratio in the local ISM (8.1 +- 0.8) within error
margin. Then there is no clear evidence of 18O depletion in CO gas of the disk,
although we could not draw any robust conclusion due to large uncertainties. In
conclusion, optically thin lines of HCO+ isotopologues are useful tracers of CO
isotopic ratios, which are hardly constrained directly from optically thick
lines of CO isotopologues. Future higher sensitivity observations of H13CO+ and
HC18O+ would be able to allow us to better constrain the oxygen fractionation
in the disk.

Title:Properties of Type Ibn Supernovae: Implications for the Progenitor Evolution and the Origin of a Population of Rapid Transients,"
Abstract:  Type Ibn Supernovae (SNe Ibn) show signatures of strong interaction between
the SN ejecta and hydrogen-poor circumstellar matter (CSM). Deriving the ejecta
and CSM properties of SNe Ibn provides a great opportunity to study the final
evolution of massive stars. In the present work, we present a light curve (LC)
model for the ejecta-CSM interaction, taking into account the processes in
which the high-energy photons originally created at the forward and reverse
shocks are converted to the observed emission in the optical. The model is
applied to a sample of SNe Ibn and `SN Ibn' rapidly evolving transients. We
show that the characteristic post-peak behavior commonly seen in the SN Ibn
LCs, where a slow decay is followed by a rapid decay, is naturally explained by
the transition of the forward-shock property from cooling to adiabatic regime
without introducing a change in the CSM density distribution. The
(commonly-found) slope in the rapid decay phase indicates a steep CSM density
gradient (rho_CSM ~ r^{-3}), inferring a rapid increase in the mass-loss rate
toward the SN as a generic properties of the SN Ibn progenitors. From the
derived ejecta and CSM properties, we argue that massive Wolf-Rayet stars with
the initial mass of >~ 18 Msun can be a potential class of the progenitors. The
present work also indicates existence of currently missing population of
UV-bright rapid transients for which the final mass-loss rate is lower than the
optical SNe Ibn, which can be efficiently probed by future UV missions.

Title:Osaka Feedback Model II: Modeling Supernova Feedback Based on High-Resolution Simulations,"
Abstract:  Feedback from supernovae (SNe) is an essential mechanism that self-regulates
the growth of galaxies, and a better model of SN feedback is still needed in
galaxy formation simulations. In the first part of this paper, using an
Eulerian hydrodynamic code Athena++, we find universal scaling relations for
the time evolution of momentum and radius for a superbubble, when the momentum
and time are scaled by those at the shell-formation time. In the second part of
this paper, we develop an SN feedback model based on the Athena++ simulation
results utilizing Voronoi tessellation around each star particle, and implement
it into the GADGET3-Osaka smoothed particle hydrodynamic code. Our feedback
model was demonstrated to be isotropic and conservative in terms of energy and
momentum. We examined the mass/energy/metal loading factors and find that our
stochastic thermal feedback model produced galactic outflow that carries metals
high above the galactic plane but with weak suppression of star formation.
Additional mechanical feedback further suppressed star formation and brought
the simulation results in better agreement with the observations of the
Kennicutt--Schmidt relation, with all the results being within the
uncertainties of observed data. We argue that both thermal and mechanical
feedback are necessary for the SN feedback model of galaxy evolution when an
individual SN bubble is unresolved.

Title:The effects of stellar gravity darkening on high-resolution transmission spectra,"
Abstract:  High-resolution transmission spectroscopy is a powerful method for probing
the extended atmospheres of short-period exoplanets. With the advancement of
ultra-stable echelle spectrographs and the advent of 30-meter class telescopes
on the horizon, even minor observational and physical effects will become
important when modeling atmospheric absorption of atomic species. In this work
we demonstrate how the non-uniform temperature across the surface of a fast
rotating star, i.e., gravity darkening, can affect the observed transmission
spectrum in a handful of atomic transitions commonly observed in short-period
exoplanet atmospheres. We simulate transits of the ultra-hot Jupiters KELT-9 b
and HAT-P-70 b but our results are applicable to all short-period gas giants
transiting rapidly rotating stars. In general, we find that gravity darkening
has a small effect on the average transmission spectrum but can change the
shape of the absorption light curve, similar to the effect observed in
broadband photometric transits. While the magnitude of gravity darkening
effects are on the same order as the noise in transmission spectra observed
with 10-meter class telescopes, future high-quality spectroscopic light curves
for individual atomic absorption lines collected with 30-meter class telescopes
will need to account for this effect.

Title:A Spectroscopic View of the JWST/GTO Strong Lensing Cluster A1489,"
Abstract:  We discuss a spectroscopic survey of the strong lensing cluster A1489 that
includes redshifts for 195 cluster members along with central velocity
dispersions for 188 cluster members. The caustic technique applied to the
redshift survey gives the dynamical parameters $M_{200} = (1.25~\pm~0.09)
\times 10^{15}~M_\odot$, $r_{200} = 1.97~\pm~{0.05}$ Mpc, and a cluster line-of
sight velocity dispersion $1150~\pm~{72}~$km$~$s$^{-1}$ within $r_{200}$. These
parameters are very similar to those of other strong lensing systems with
comparably large Einstein radii. We use the spectroscopy and deep photometry to
demonstrate that A1489 is probably dynamically active; its four BCGs have
remarkably different rest frame radial velocities. Like other massive strong
lensing clusters, the velocity dispersion function for members of A1489 shows
an excess for dispersions $\geq~250~$km$~$s$^{-1}$. The central dispersions
also provide enhanced constraints on future lensing models.

Title:Hydrothermal activities on C-complex asteroids induced by radioactivity,"
Abstract:  C-complex asteroids, rich in carbonaceous materials, are potential sources of
Earth's volatile inventories. They are spectrally dark resembling primitive
carbonaceous meteorites, and thus, C-complex asteroids are thought to be
potential parent bodies of carbonaceous meteorites. However, the substantial
number of C-complex asteroids exhibits surface spectra with weaker hydroxyl
absorption than water-rich carbonaceous meteorites. Rather, they best
correspond to meteorites showing evidence for dehydration, commonly attributed
to impact heating. Here, we report an old radiometric age of 4564.7 million
years ago for Ca-carbonates from the Jbilet Winselwan meteorite analogous to
dehydrated C-complex asteroids. The carbonates are enclosed by a
high-temperature polymorph of Ca-sulfates, suggesting thermal metamorphism at
>300C subsequently after aqueous alteration. This old age indicates the
early onset of aqueous alteration and subsequent thermal metamorphism driven by
the decay of short-lived radionuclides rather than impact heating. The breakup
of original asteroids internally heated by radioactivity should result in
asteroid families predominantly consisting of thermally metamorphosed
materials. This explains the common occurrence of dehydrated C-complex
asteroids.

Title:A comprehensive observational study of the FRB 121102 persistent radio source,"
Abstract:  FRB 121102 is the first fast radio burst source to be spatially associated
with a persistent radio source (QRS121102), the nature of which remains
unknown. We present a detailed observational study of QRS121102 and its host
galaxy. We constrain the physical size of QRS121102 by measuring its
flux-density variability with the VLA in the Ku-band (12 to 18 GHz) and the
K-band (18 to 26 GHz). Any such variability would likely be due to Galactic
refractive scintillation and would require the source radius to be <10^17 cm at
the host-galaxy redshift. We found the radio variability to be lower than the
scintillation theory predictions for such a small source, leaving open the
possibility for non-AGN models for QRS121102. In addition, we roughly estimated
the mass of any potential supermassive black hole (SMBH) associated with
QRS121102 from the width of the H\alpha emission line using a medium-resolution
optical spectrum from the Keck Observatory. The line width gives a velocity
dispersion of <30 km/s, indicating a SMBH mass of <10^{4~5} M_sun. We find the
SMBH mass too low for the observed radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity
constraints, if QRS121102 were an AGN. Finally, some dwarf galaxies that host
SMBH may be the stripped cores of massive galaxies during the tidal
interactions with companion systems. We find no nearby galaxy at the same
redshift as the QRS121102 host from low-resolution Keck spectra, or from the
PanSTARRS catalog. In conclusion, we find no evidence supporting the hypothesis
that the persistent radio source associated with FRB 121102 is an AGN. We
instead argue that the inferred size, and the flat radio spectrum, favors a
plerion interpretation. We urge continued broadband radio monitoring of
QRS121102 to search for long-term evolution, and the detailed evaluation of
potential analogs that may provide greater insight into the nature of this
class of object.

Title:Helium fluxes measured by the PAMELA experiment from the minimum to the maximum solar activity for solar cycle 24,"
Abstract:  Time-dependent energy spectra of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) carry
fundamental information regarding their origin and propagation. When observed
at the Earth, these spectra are significantly affected by the solar wind and
the embedded solar magnetic field that permeates the heliosphere, changing
significantly over an 11-year solar cycle. Energy spectra of GCRs measured
during different epochs of solar activity provide crucial information for a
thorough understanding of solar and heliospheric phenomena. The PAMELA
experiment had collected data for almost ten years (15th June 2006 - 23rd
January 2016), including the minimum phase of solar cycle 23 and the maximum
phase of solar cycle 24. In this paper, we present new spectra for helium
nuclei measured by the PAMELA instrument from January 2010 to September 2014
over a three Carrington rotation time basis. These data are compared to the
PAMELA spectra measured during the previous solar minimum providing a picture
of the time dependence of the helium nuclei fluxes over a nearly full solar
cycle. Time and rigidity dependencies are observed in the proton-to-helium flux
ratios. The force-field approximation of the solar modulation was used to
relate these dependencies to the shapes of the local interstellar proton and
helium-nuclei spectra.

Title:The cusp-core problem in gas-poor dwarf spheroidal galaxies,"
Abstract:  This review deals with the inconsistency of inner dark matter density
profiles in dwarf galaxies, known as the cusp-core problem. Particularly, we
aim to focus on gas-poor dwarf galaxies. One of the most promising solutions to
this cold dark matter small scale issue is the stellar feedback but it seems to
be only designed for gas-rich dwarfs. However, in the regime of classical
dwarfs, this core mechanism becomes negligible. Therefore, it is required to
find solutions without invoking these baryonic processes as dark matter cores
tend to persist even for these dwarfs, which are rather dark matter-dominated.
Here we have presented two categories of solutions. One consists of creating
dark matter cores from cusps within cold dark matter by altering the dark
matter potential via perturbers. The second category gathers solutions which
depict the natural emergence of dark matter cores in alternative theories.
Given the wide variety of solutions, it becomes necessary to identify which
mechanism dominates in the central region of galaxies by finding observational
signatures left by them in order to highlight the true nature of dark matter.

Title:Unified $f(R)$ gravity at local scales,"
Abstract:  We explore the shifted $f(R) (\propto R^{1+\delta})$ model with ${\delta}$ as
a distinguishing physical parameter for the study of constraints at local
scales. The corresponding dynamics confronted with different geodesics (null
and non-null) along with its conformal analogue is investigated. For null
geodesics, we discuss the light deflection angle, whereas for non-null
geodesics under the weak field limit, we investigate the perihelion advance of
the Mercury orbit in $f(R)$ Schwarzschild background, respectively. The extent
of an additional force, appearing for non-null geodesics, depends on $\delta$.
Such phenomenological investigations allow us to strictly constrain $\delta$ to
be approximately $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ with a difference of unity in orders at
galactic and planetary scales and seems to provide a unique $f(R)$ at local
scales. Further, at late cosmic time, we analyse the constraint on $\delta$ via
the bare scalar self-interaction Einstein frame potential to provide a null
test of dark energy. We constrain the deviation parameter, $\mid\delta\mid$ to
$(\approx 0.6)$ which is in a close agreement with the results obtained through
various observations in the Jordan frame by several authors. Our results
suggest that the present form of model is suitable for the alternate
explanation of dark matter-like effects at local scales, whereas at large
scales the deviations grow higher and must be addressed in terms of the
accelerated background.

Title:Confirmation of intermediate-mass black holes candidates with X-ray observations,"
Abstract:  The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers still remains
uncertain. There are two possible ways of their formation - from massive ($10^5
- 10^6 M_{\odot}$) and low-mass ($100 M_{\odot}$) BH nuclei. The latter
scenario should leave behind a large number of intermediate mass black holes
(IMBH, $10^2 - 10^5 M_{\odot}$). The largest published sample of bona-fide
IMBH-powered AGN contains 10 objects confirmed in X-ray. Here we present a new
sample of 15 bona-fide IMBHs, obtained by confirming the optically selected
IMBH candidates by the presence of radiation from the galactic nucleus in the
X-ray range, which increases the number of confirmed IMBHs at the centers of
galaxies by 2.5 times. In the same way, 99 black holes with masses of
$2\cdot10^5 - 10^6 M_{\odot}$ were confirmed. The sources of X-ray data were
publicly available catalogs, archives of data, and our own observations on
XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift. The Eddington coefficients for 30% of the
objects from both samples turned out to be close to critical, from 0.5 to 1,
which is an unusually high fraction. Also for the first time for light-weight
SMBH the correlations between the luminosity in the [OIII] emission line or the
broad component of the $H\alpha$ line and the luminosity in the X-ray range
were plotted.

Title:New Tests of Millilensing in the Blazar PKS 1413+135,"
Abstract:  Symmetric Achromatic Variability (SAV) is a rare form of radio variability in
blazars that has been attributed to gravitational millilensing by a ~$10^2 -
10^5$ $M_\odot$ mass condensate. Four SAVs have been identified between 1980
and 2020 in the long-term radio monitoring data of the blazar PKS 1413+135. We
show that all four can be fitted with the same, unchanging, gravitational lens
model. If SAV is due to gravitational millilensing, PKS 1413+135 provides a
unique system for studying active galactic nuclei with unprecedented
microarcsecond resolution, as well as for studying the nature of the millilens
itself. We discuss two possible candidates for the putative millilens: a giant
molecular cloud hosted in the intervening edge-on spiral galaxy, and an
undetected dwarf galaxy with a massive black hole. We find a significant
dependence of SAV crossing time on frequency, which could indicate a fast shock
moving in a slower underlying flow. We also find tentative evidence for a
989-day periodicity in the SAVs, which, if real, makes possible the prediction
of future SAVs: the next three windows for possible SAVs begin in August 2022,
May 2025, and February 2028.

make the telescope a suitable tool in the search for hypothetical heavy compact

density and speed. The most prominent example are the nuclearites --
hypothetical lumps of strange quark matter that could be stabler and denser
than the nuclear matter. In this paper, we show potential limits on the flux of
nuclearites after collecting 42 hours of observations data.

Abstract:  Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) represent a fundamental tool to calibrate the

population tracers in the context of Galactic studies. The forthcoming Data
Release 3 (DR3) of the Gaia mission will allow us to study, with unprecedented
detail, the structure, the dynamics, and the chemical properties of the
Galactic disc, and in particular of the spiral arms, where most Galactic DCEPs
reside. In this paper, we aim to quantify the metallicity dependence of the
Galactic DCEPs' period-Wesenheit ($PWZ$) relation in the Gaia bands. We adopted
a sample of 499 DCEPs with metal abundances from high-resolution spectroscopy,
in conjunction with Gaia Early Data Release 3 parallaxes and photometry to
calibrate a $PWZ$ relation in the Gaia bands. We find a significant metallicity
term, of the order of $-$0.5 mag/dex, which is larger than the values measured
in the near-infrared (NIR) bands by different authors. Our best $PWZ$ relation
is $W=(-5.988\pm0.018)-(3.176\pm0.044)(\log P-1.0)-(0.520\pm0.090){\rm
[Fe/H]}$. We validated our $PWZ$ relations by using the distance to the Large
Magellanic Cloud as a benchmark, finding very good agreement with the geometric
distance provided by eclipsing binaries. As an additional test, we evaluated
the metallicity gradient of the young Galactic disc, finding $-0.0527 \pm
0.0022$ dex/kpc, which is in very good agreement with previous results.

Title:Focusing of nonlinear eccentric waves in astrophysical discs. II. Excitation and damping of tightly-wound waves,"
Abstract:  In this paper I develop a nonlinear theory of tightly-wound (highly twisted)
eccentric waves in astrophysical discs, based on the averaged Lagrangian method
of Whitham. Viscous dissipation is included in the theory by use of a
pseudo-Lagrangian. This work is an extension of the theory developed by Lee \&
Goodman to 3D discs, with the addition of viscosity. I confirm that linear
tightly-wound eccentric waves are overstable and are excited by the presence of
a shear viscosity and show this persists for weakly nonlinear waves. I find the
waves are damped by shear viscosity when the wave become sufficiently
nonlinear, a result previously found in particulate discs. Additionally I
compare the results of this model to recent simulations of eccentric waves
propagating in the inner regions of black hole discs and show that an ingoing
eccentric wave can be strongly damped near the marginally stable orbit,
resulting in a nearly circular disc with a strong azimuthal variation in the
disc density.

spectral, and polarimetric analysis of the prompt emission observed using
\AstroSat and \fermi to provide insight into the prompt emission radiation
mechanisms. The time-integrated spectrum shows conclusive proof of two breaks
due to peak energy and a second lower energy break. Time-integrated (55.43
$\pm$ 21.30 \%) as well as time-resolved polarization measurements, made by the
Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) onboard \AstroSat, show a hint of high
degree of polarization. The presence of a hint of high degree of polarization
and the values of low energy spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm pt}$) do not run over
the synchrotron limit for the first two pulses, supporting the synchrotron
origin in an ordered magnetic field. However, during the third pulse,
$\alpha_{\rm pt}$ exceeds the synchrotron line of death in few bins, and a
thermal signature along with the synchrotron component in the time-resolved
spectra is observed. Furthermore, we also report the earliest optical
observations constraining afterglow polarization using the MASTER (P $<$ 1.3

Title:Quantifying Uncertainty in Deep Learning Approaches to Radio Galaxy Classification,"
Abstract:  In this work we use variational inference to quantify the degree of
uncertainty in deep learning model predictions of radio galaxy classification.
We show that the level of model posterior variance for individual test samples
is correlated with human uncertainty when labelling radio galaxies. We explore
the model performance and uncertainty calibration for different weight priors
and suggest that a sparse prior produces more well-calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Using the posterior distributions for individual weights, we
demonstrate that we can prune 30% of the fully-connected layer weights without
significant loss of performance by removing the weights with the lowest
signal-to-noise ratio. A larger degree of pruning can be achieved using a
Fisher information based ranking, but both pruning methods affect the
uncertainty calibration for Fanaroff-Riley type I and type II radio galaxies
differently. Like other work in this field, we experience a cold posterior
effect, whereby the posterior must be down-weighted to achieve good predictive
performance. We examine whether adapting the cost function to accommodate model
misspecification can compensate for this effect, but find that it does not make
a significant difference. We also examine the effect of principled data
augmentation and find that this improves upon the baseline but also does not
compensate for the observed effect. We interpret this as the cold posterior
effect being due to the overly effective curation of our training sample
leading to likelihood misspecification, and raise this as a potential issue for
Bayesian deep learning approaches to radio galaxy classification in future.

Title:Detailed analysis on the reflection component for the black hole candidate MAXI J1348-630,"
Abstract:  The black hole candidate MAXI J1348-630 was discovered on January 26th, 2019,
with the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) on-board \textit{MAXI}. We report a detailed
spectral analysis of this source by using the archived data of \textit{NuSTAR}.
A total of 9 observations covered the complete outburst evolution of MAXI
J1348-630 from the hard state to the soft state and finally back to the hard
state. Additionally, the intermediate state is found in the transition from the
hard state to the soft state. We use the state-of-art reflection model
\verb'relxill' family to fit all the 9 spectra, and the spectra from two focal
plane module detectors of \textit{NuSTAR} are jointly fitted for each
observation. In particular, we concentrate on the results of the black hole
spin parameter and the inclination of the accretion disk. Based on the analysis
of the inner radius of the accretion disk, we obtain the spin parameter $a_*
=0.78_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$, and the inclination angle of the inner disk $i =
29.2_{-0.5}^{+0.3}$ degrees. Furthermore, we also find that when the black hole
is in the hard state, the accretion disk would show a significant truncation.
The high iron abundance and ionization of the accretion disk obtained in the
fitting results can be possibly explained by the high density of the accretion
disk.

Title:The Mini-EUSO telescope on board the International Space Station: Launch and first results,"
Abstract:  Mini-EUSO is a telescope launched on board the International Space Station in
2019 and currently located in the Russian section of the station. Main
scientific objectives of the mission are the search for nuclearites and Strange
Quark Matter, the study of atmospheric phenomena such as Transient Luminous
Events, meteors and meteoroids, the observation of sea bioluminescence and of
artificial satellites and man-made space debris. It is also capable of
observing Extensive Air Showers generated by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays with
an energy above 10$^{21}$ eV and detect artificial showers generated with
lasers from the ground. Mini-EUSO can map the night-time Earth in the UV range
(290 - 430 nm), with a spatial resolution of about 6.3 km and a temporal
resolution of 2.5 $\mu$s, observing our planet through a nadir-facing
UV-transparent window in the Russian Zvezda module. The instrument, launched on
2019/08/22 from the Baikonur cosmodrome, is based on an optical system
employing two Fresnel lenses and a focal surface composed of 36 Multi-Anode
Photomultiplier tubes, 64 channels each, for a total of 2304 channels with
single photon counting sensitivity and an overall field of view of
44$^{\circ}$. Mini-EUSO also contains two ancillary cameras to complement
measurements in the near infrared and visible ranges. In this paper we describe
the detector and present the various phenomena observed in the first year of
operation.

Title:Differentiating between sharp and smoother phase transitions in neutron stars,"
Abstract:  The internal composition of neutron stars is still an open issue in
astrophysics. Their innermost regions are impervious to light propagation and
gravitational waves mostly carry global aspects of stars, meaning that only
indirect inferences of their interiors could be obtained. Here we assume a
hypothetical future scenario in which an equation of state softening due to a
phase transition is identified and estimate the observational accuracy to
differentiate a sharp phase transition from a smoother one (associated with a
mixed phase/state due to the unknown value of the surface tension of dense
matter) in a region of a hybrid star by means of some electromagnetic and
gravitational wave observables. We show that different transition constructions
lead to similar sequences of stellar configurations due to their shared
thermodynamic properties. In the most optimistic case - a strong quark-hadron
density jump phase transition - radius observations require fractional
uncertainties smaller than $1\%-2\%$ to differentiate mixed states from sharp
phase transitions. For tidal deformabilities, relative uncertainties should be
smaller than $5\%-10\%$. However, for masses around the onset of stable quark
cores, relative tidal deformability differences associated with strong sharp
phase transitions and mixed states could be much larger (up to around
$20\%-30\%$). All the above suggests that 2.5- and 3rd generation gravitational
wave detectors and near-term electromagnetic missions may be able to start
assessing some particular aspects of phase transitions in neutron stars. In
addition, it points to some limitations on the equation of state recovery using
typical neutron star observables and the impact of systematic uncertainties on
modellings of the equation of state of hybrid stars. Finally, we briefly
discuss other observables that may also be relevant for the probe of mixed
states in stars.

Title:Propagation and attenuation of pulses driven by low velocity normal impacts in granular media,"
Abstract:  We carry out experiments of low velocity normal impacts into granular
materials that fill an approximately cylindrical 42 litre tub. Motions in the
granular medium are tracked with an array of 7 embedded accelerometers.
Longitudinal pulses excited by the impact attenuate and their shapes broaden
and become smoother as a function of travel distance from the site of impact.
Pulse propagation is not spherically symmetric about the site of impact. Peak
amplitudes are about twice as large for the pulse propagating downward than at
45 degrees from vertical. An advection-diffusion model is used to estimate the
dependence of pulse properties as a function of travel distance from the site
of impact. The power law forms for pulse peak pressure, velocity and seismic
energy depend on distance from impact to a power of -2.5 and this rapid decay
is approximately consistent with our experimental measurements. Our experiments
support a seismic jolt model, giving rapid attenuation of impact generated
seismic energy into rubble asteroids, rather than a reverberation model, where
seismic energy slowly decays. We apply our diffusive model to estimate physical
properties of the seismic pulse that will be excited by the forthcoming DART
mission impact onto the secondary, Dimorphos, of the asteroid binary (65803)
Didymos system. We estimate that the pulse peak acceleration will exceed the
surface gravity as it travels through the asteroid.

"Title:Eclipsing Binaries in Dynamically Interacting Close, Multiple Systems","
Abstract:  Close, compact, hierarchical, multiple stellar systems, i.e., multiples
having an outer orbital period from months to a few years, comprise a small,
but continuously growing group of the triple and multiple star zoo. Many of
them consist of at least one eclipsing pair of stars and, therefore, exhibit
readily observable short-term dynamical interactions among the components.
Thus, their dynamical and astrophysical properties can be explored with high
precision. In this paper we present an overview of the history of the search
for additional components around eclipsing binaries from the first
serendipitous discoveries to more systematic recent studies. We describe the
different observational detection methods and discuss their connections to the
different kinds of astrophysical and dynamical information that can be mined
from the different datasets. Moreover, the connection amongst the observable
phenomena and the long-term dynamics of such systems is also discussed.

Title:Limits on primordial black holes detectability with Isatis: A BlackHawk tool,"
Abstract:  Primordial black holes (PBHs) are convenient candidates to explain the
elusive dark matter (DM). However, years of constraints from various
astronomical observations have constrained their abundance over a wide range of
masses, leaving only a narrow window open at $10^{17}\,{\rm g} \lesssim M
\lesssim 10^{22}\,$g for all DM in the form of PBHs. We reexamine this disputed
window with a critical eye, interrogating the general hypotheses underlying the
direct photon constraints. We review 4 levels of assumptions: i) instrument
characteristics, ii) prediction of the (extra)galactic photon flux, iii)
statistical method of signal-to-data comparison and iv) computation of the
Hawking radiation rate. Thanks to Isatis, a new tool designed for the public
Hawking radiation code BlackHawk, we first revisit the existing and prospective
constraints on the PBH abundance and investigate the impact of assumptions
i)-iv). We show that the constraints can vary by several orders of magnitude,
advocating the necessity of a reduction of the theoretical sources of
uncertainties. Second, we consider an ""ideal"" instrument and we demonstrate
that the PBH DM scenario can only be constrained by the direct photon Hawking
radiation phenomenon below $M_{\rm max} \sim 10^{20}\,$g. The upper part of the
mass window should therefore be closed by other means.

Title:Robust absolute solar flux density calibration for the Murchison Widefield Array,"
Abstract:  Sensitive radio instruments are optimized for observing faint astronomical
sources, and usually need to attenuate the received signal when observing the
Sun. There are only a handful of flux density calibrators which can comfortably
be observed with the same attenuation setup as the Sun. Additionally, for wide
field-of-view (FoV) instruments like the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)
calibrator observations are generally done when the Sun is below the horizon to
avoid the contamination from solar emissions. These considerations imply that
the usual radio interferometric approach to flux density calibration is not
applicable for solar imaging. A novel technique, relying on a good sky model
and detailed characterization of the MWA hardware, was developed for solar flux
density calibration for MWA. Though successful, this technique is not general
enough to be extended to the data from the extended configuration of the MWA
Phase II. Here, we present a robust flux density calibration method for solar
observations with MWA independent of the array configuration. We use different
approaches -- the serendipitous presence of strong sources; detection of
numerous background sources using high dynamic range images in the FoV along
with the Sun and observations of strong flux density calibrators with and
without the additional attenuation used for solar observations; to obtain the
flux scaling parameters required for the flux density calibration. Using the
present method, we have achieved an absolute flux density uncertainty
$\sim10\%$ for solar observations even in the absence of dedicated calibrator
observations.

Title:A tale of two double quasars: Hubble constant tension or biases?,"
Abstract:  For a flat $\Lambda$CDM (standard) cosmology, a small sample of
gravitationally lensed quasars with measured time delays has recently provided
a value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ in tension with the $Planck$ flat
$\Lambda$CDM result. Trying to check if this tension is real or not, we used
basic observational constraints for two double quasars of the GLENDAMA sample
(SBS 0909+532 and SDSS J1339+1310) to discuss the underlying value of $H_0$ in
a standard cosmology. For SBS 0909+532, we were not able to obtain a reliable
measurement of $H_0$. However, the current data of SDSS J1339+1310 are
consistent with $H_0$ around 67.8 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\sigma (H_0)/H_0
\sim$ 10%. Although the formal uncertainty is still large and mainly due to the
lack of details on the mass density profile of the main lens galaxy, the
central value of $H_0$ coincides with that of the TDCOSMO+SLACS collaboration
(using gravitational lens systems) and is within the 1$\sigma$ interval from
$Planck$ cosmic microwave background data. After getting these preliminary
encouraging results through only one double quasar, we are currently planning
to use several GLENDAMA systems to accurately measure the Hubble constant and
put constraints on other cosmological parameters.

Title:On the nature of radio-wave radiation from particle cascades,"
Abstract:  The nature of the radio-wave radiation generated by particle cascades in both
the Earth's atmosphere and dense media such as ice has, historically, been much
debated. This situation changed in the early 2010's, with the community
converging on the common terminology of ""geomagnetic"" and ""Askaryan"" radiation
to describe the two emission mechanisms. However, this convergence arose from
discussions at various conferences and workshops, and was ultimately reached
through agreement between simulation codes and experimental measurements. In
this article therefore, I use relatively simple geometrical arguments, and a
minimum of calculations based on single particle tracks, to explain the nature
of radiation from extensive air showers (EAS) and cascades in dense media such
as ice. I identify well-determined frequency regimes where the radiation from
the Askaryan effect will be bremsstrahlung-like and Cherenkov-like, being
respectively below/above 1 GHz in EAS and 100 MHz in dense media; and where
geomagnetic emission will be transverse-current-like and where it will resemble
synchrotron radiation, respectively below/above a few GHz in EAS, depending on
the height of cascade development. I suggest how these transitions in the
nature of the emission may be experimentally observed.

Title:Evidence of large recoil velocity from a black hole merger signal,"
Abstract:  The final black hole left behind after a binary black hole merger can attain
a recoil velocity, or a ""kick"", reaching values up to 5000 km/s. This
phenomenon has important implications for gravitational wave astronomy, black
hole formation scenarios, testing general relativity, and galaxy evolution. We
consider the gravitational wave signal from the binary black hole merger
GW200129_065458 (henceforth referred to as GW200129), which has been shown to
exhibit strong evidence of orbital precession. Using numerical relativity
surrogate models, we constrain the kick velocity of GW200129 to $v_f \sim
1542^{+747}_{-1098}$ km/s or $v_f \gtrsim 698$ km/s (one-sided limit), at 90\%
credibility. This marks the first identification of a large kick velocity for
an individual gravitational wave event. Given the kick velocity of GW200129, we
estimate that there is a less than $0.48\%$ ($7.7\%$) probability that the
remnant black hole after the merger would be retained by globular (nuclear
star) clusters. Finally, we show that kick effects are not expected to cause
biases in ringdown tests of general relativity for this event, although this
may change in the future with improved detectors.

Title:ALMA measures molecular gas reservoirs comparable to field galaxies in a low-mass galaxy cluster at z=1.3,"
Abstract:  We report the serendipitous discovery of an overdensity of CO emitters in an
X-ray-identified cluster (Log$_{10}$M$_{\rm halo}/M_{\odot}\sim13.6$ at
z=1.3188) using ALMA. We present spectroscopic confirmation of 6 new cluster
members exhibiting CO(2-1) emission, adding to 2 existing optical/IR
spectroscopic members undetected in CO. This is the lowest mass cluster to date
at z>1 with molecular gas measurements, bridging the observational gap between
galaxies in the more extreme, well-studied clusters (Log$_{10}$~M$_{\rm
halo}/M_{\odot}\gtrsim14$) and those in group or field environments at cosmic
noon. The CO sources are concentrated on the sky (within ~1-arcmin diameter)
and phase space analysis indicates the gas resides in galaxies already within
the cluster environment. We find that CO sources sit in similar phase space as
CO-rich galaxies in more massive clusters at similar redshifts (have similar
accretion histories) while maintaining field-like molecular gas reservoirs,
compared to scaling relations. This work presents the deepest CO survey to date
in a galaxy cluster at z>1, uncovering gas reservoirs down to M$_{\rm
H_{2}}>1.6\times10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$ (5$\sigma$ at 50% primary beam). Our deep
limits rule out the presence of gas content in excess of the field scaling
relations; however, combined with literature CO detections, cluster gas
fractions in general appear systematically high, on the upper envelope or above
the field. This study is the first demonstration that low mass clusters at
z~1-2 can host overdensities of CO emitters with surviving gas reservoirs, in
line with the prediction that quenching is delayed after first infall while
galaxies consume the gas bound to the disk.

Title:Augmenting astrophysical scaling relations with machine learning : application to reducing the SZ flux-mass scatter,"
Abstract:  Complex systems (stars, supernovae, galaxies, and clusters) often exhibit low
scatter relations between observable properties (e.g., luminosity, velocity
dispersion, oscillation period, temperature). These scaling relations can
illuminate the underlying physics and can provide observational tools for
estimating masses and distances. Machine learning can provide a systematic way
to search for new scaling relations (or for simple extensions to existing
relations) in abstract high-dimensional parameter spaces. We use a machine
learning tool called symbolic regression (SR), which models the patterns in a
given dataset in the form of analytic equations. We focus on the
Sunyaev-Zeldovich flux$-$cluster mass relation ($Y_\mathrm{SZ}-M$), the scatter
in which affects inference of cosmological parameters from cluster abundance
data. Using SR on the data from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, we
find a new proxy for cluster mass which combines $Y_\mathrm{SZ}$ and
concentration of ionized gas ($c_\mathrm{gas}$): $M \propto
Y_\mathrm{conc}^{3/5} \equiv Y_\mathrm{SZ}^{3/5} (1-A\, c_\mathrm{gas})$.
$Y_\mathrm{conc}$ reduces the scatter in the predicted $M$ by $\sim 20-30$% for
large clusters ($M\gtrsim 10^{14}\, h^{-1} \, M_\odot$) at both high and low
redshifts, as compared to using just $Y_\mathrm{SZ}$. We show that the
dependence on $c_\mathrm{gas}$ is linked to cores of clusters exhibiting larger
scatter than their outskirts. Finally, we test $Y_\mathrm{conc}$ on clusters
from simulations of the CAMELS project and show that $Y_\mathrm{conc}$ is
robust against variations in cosmology, astrophysics, subgrid physics, and
cosmic variance. Our results and methodology can be useful for accurate
multiwavelength cluster mass estimation from current and upcoming CMB and X-ray
surveys like ACT, SO, SPT, eROSITA and CMB-S4.

Title:Relationships Between Stellar Velocity Dispersion and the Atmospheres of Early-Type Galaxies,"
Abstract:  The Voit et al. (2020) black hole feedback valve model predicts relationships
between stellar velocity dispersion and atmospheric structure among massive
early-type galaxies. In this work, we test that model using the Chandra
archival sample of 49 early-type galaxies from Lakhchaura et al. (2018). We
consider relationships between stellar velocity dispersion and entropy profile
slope, multiphase gas extent, and the ratio of cooling time to freefall time.
We also define subsamples based on data quality and entropy profile properties
that clarify those relationships and enable more specific tests of the model
predictions. We find that the atmospheric properties of early-type galaxies
generally align with the predictions of the Voit et al. (2020) model, in that
galaxies with greater stellar velocity dispersion tend to have radial profiles
of pressure, gas density, and entropy with steeper slopes and less extended
multiphase gas. Quantitative agreement with the model predictions improves when
the sample is restricted to have low central entropy and stellar velocity
dispersion of between 220 and 300 km/s.

imaging of 126 massive (log $M_{\star} / M_{\odot} \gtrsim 10.5$), star-forming
cluster galaxies across 11 galaxy clusters at $z=1-1.75$. Using stacking
analysis on the ALMA images, combined with UV-far-infrared data, we quantify
the average infrared SEDs and gas properties (molecular gas masses, $M_{\rm
mol}$; gas depletion timescales, $\tau_{\rm depl}$; and gas fractions, f$_{\rm
gas}$) as a function of cluster-centric radius and properties including stellar
mass and distance from the Main Sequence. We find a significant dearth in the
ALMA fluxes relative to that expected in the field $-$ with correspondingly low
$M_{\rm mol}$ and f$_{\rm gas}$ and short $\tau_{\rm depl}$ $-$ with weak or no
dependence on cluster-centric radius out to twice the virial radius. The
Herschel+ALMA SEDs indicate warmer dust temperatures ($\sim36-38$ K) than
coeval field galaxies ($\sim30$ K). We perform a thorough comparison of the
cluster galaxy gas properties to field galaxies, finding deficits of 2-3x,
3-4x, and 2-4x in $M_{\rm mol}$, $\tau_{\rm depl}$, and f$_{\rm gas}$ compared
to coeval field stacks and larger deficits compared to field scaling relations
built primarily on detections. The cluster gas properties derived here are
comparable with stacking analyses in (proto-)clusters in the literature and at
odds with findings of field-like $\tau_{\rm depl}$ and enhanced f$_{\rm gas}$
reported using CO and dust continuum detections. Our analysis suggests that
environment has considerable impact on gas properties out to large radii, in
good agreement with cosmological simulations which project gas depletion begins
beyond the virial radius and largely completes by first passage of the cluster
core.

Title:A stellar stream remnant of a globular cluster below the metallicity floor,"
Abstract:  Stellar ejecta gradually enrich the gas out of which subsequent stars form,
making the least chemically enriched stellar systems direct fossils of
structures formed in the early universe. Although a few hundred stars with
metal content below one thousandth of the solar iron content are known in the
Galaxy, none of them inhabit globular clusters, some of the oldest known
stellar structures. These show metal content of at least ~0.2 percent of the
solar metallicity ([Fe/H] > -2.7). This metallicity floor appears universal and
it has been proposed that proto-galaxies that merge into the galaxies we
observe today were simply not massive enough to form clusters that survived to
the present day. Here, we report the discovery of a stellar stream, C-19, whose
metallicity is less than 0.05 per cent the solar metallicity ([Fe/H]=-3.38 +/-
0.06 (stat.) +/- 0.20 (syst.)). The low metallicity dispersion and the chemical
abundances of the C-19 stars show that this stream is the tidal remnant of the
most metal-poor globular cluster ever discovered, and significantly below the
purported metallicity floor: clusters with significantly lower metallicities
than observed today existed in the past and contributed their stars to the
Milky Way halo.

distribution function, which provides an independent check of the reality of
these structures, supporting the reliability of STREAMFINDER in finding streams
and the power of Pristine to measure precise metallicities. We further present
6 candidate structures with coherent phase-space and metallicity signals that
are very likely streams. The majority of studied streams are very metal-poor
(14 structures with [Fe/H]<-2.0) and include 3 systems with [Fe/H]<-2.9 (C-11,
C-19, and C-20). These streams could be the closest debris of low-luminosity
dwarf galaxies or may have originated from globular clusters of significantly
lower metallicity than any known current Milky Way globular cluster. Our study
shows that the promise of the Gaia data for Galactic Archeology studies can be
substantially strengthened by quality photometric metallicities, allowing us to
peer back into the earliest epochs of the formation of our Galaxy and its
stellar halo constituents.

flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relationship (FGLR), a stellar spectroscopic
distance determination method for galaxies, is extended towards stars at lower
luminosities. Point spread function fitting 3D spectroscopy was performed with
PampelMUSE on the datacube. The 16 stars with the highest signal-to-noise
ratios ($S/N s$) are classified with regard to their spectral type and
luminosity class using Galactic templates. They were analysed using hybrid
non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) model spectra to fit the
strongest observed hydrogen, helium, and metal lines in the
intermediate-resolution spectra. Supplemented by photometric data, this
facilitates fundamental stellar parameters and interstellar reddening which
have yet to be determined. Effective temperatures, surface gravities, reddening
$E(B-V)$, bolometric magnitudes and luminosities, as well as radii and masses
are presented for the sample stars. The majority of the objects follow the FGLR
as established from more luminous BA-type supergiants in NGC 300. An increase

Title:History-independent tracers: Forgetful molecular probes of the physical conditions of the dense interstellar medium,"
Abstract:  Molecular line emission is a powerful probe of the physical conditions of
astrophysical objects but can be complex to model, and it is often unclear
which transitions would be the best targets for observers who wish to constrain
a given parameter. We therefore produce a list of molecular species for which
the gas history can be ignored, removing a major modelling complexity. We then
determine the best of these species to observe when attempting to constrain
various physical parameters. To achieve this, we use a large set of chemical
models with different chemical histories to determine which species have
abundances at 1 MYr that are insensitive to the initial conditions. We then use
radiative transfer modelling to produce the intensity of every transition of
these molecules. We finally compute the mutual information between the physical
parameters and all transitions and transition ratios in order to rank their
usefulness in determining the value of a given parameter.
We find 48 species that are insensitive to the chemical history of the gas,
23 of which have collisional data available. We produce a ranked list of all
the transitions and ratios of these species using their mutual information with
various gas properties. We show mutual information is an adequate measure of
how well a transition can constrain a physical parameter by recovering known
probes and demonstrating that random forest regression models become more
accurate predictors when high-scoring features are included. Therefore, this
list can be used to select target transitions for observations in order to
maximize knowledge about those physical parameters.

"Title:Intrinsic Lyman alpha Profiles of High-Velocity G, K, and M Dwarfs","
Abstract:  Observations of H I Lyman alpha, the brightest UV emission line of late-type
stars, are critical for understanding stellar chromospheres and transition
regions, modeling photochemistry in exoplanet atmospheres, and measuring the
abundances of neutral hydrogen and deuterium in the interstellar medium. Yet,
Lyman alpha observations are notoriously challenging due to severe attenuation
from interstellar gas, hindering our understanding of this important emission
line's basic morphology. We present high-resolution far- and near-UV
spectroscopy of five G, K, and M dwarfs with radial velocities large enough to
Doppler shift the stellar Lyman alpha emission line away from much of the
interstellar attenuation, allowing the line core to be directly observed. We
detect self-reversal in the Lyman alpha emission line core for all targets, and
we show that the self-reversal depth decreases with increasing surface gravity.
Mg II self-reversed emission line profiles provide some useful information to
constrain the Lyman alpha line core, but the differences are significant enough
that Mg II cannot be used directly as an intrinsic Lyman alpha template during
reconstructions. We show that reconstructions that neglect self-reversal could
overestimate intrinsic Lyman alpha fluxes by as much as 60%-100% for G and K

Title:Simulating Jellyfish Galaxies: A Case Study for a Gas-Rich Dwarf Galaxy,"
Abstract:  We investigate the formation of jellyfish galaxies using
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of gas-rich dwarf galaxies with a
multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM). We find that the ram-pressure-stripped
(RPS) ISM is the dominant source of molecular clumps in the near wake within 10
kpc from the galactic plane, while in-situ formation is the major channel for
dense gas in the distant tail of the gas-rich galaxy. Only 20% of the molecular
clumps in the near wake originate from the intracluster medium (ICM); however,
the fraction reaches 50% in the clumps located at $80\,{\rm kpc}$ from the
galactic center since the cooling time of the RPS gas tends to be short due to
the ISM--ICM mixing ($\lesssim$ 10 Myr). The tail region exhibits a star
formation rate of $0.001-0.01\,{\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$, and most of the tail
stars are born in the stripped wake within 10 kpc from the galactic plane.
These stars induce bright H$\alpha$ blobs in the tail, while H$\alpha$ tails
fainter than $6\times10^{38}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$ are mostly formed
via collisional radiation and heating due to mixing. We also find that the
stripped tails have intermediate X-ray to H$\alpha$ surface brightness ratios
(1.5$\lesssim F_{\rm X}/F_{\rm H\alpha}\lesssim$20), compared to the ISM
($\lesssim$1.5) or pure ICM ($\gg$20). Our results suggest that jellyfish
features emerge when the ISM from gas-rich galaxies is stripped by strong ram
pressure, mixes with the ICM, and enhances the cooling in the tail.

Title:The Influence of Temperature and Photobleaching on Irradiated Sodium Chloride at Europa-like Conditions,"
Abstract:  Europa's leading hemisphere chaos regions have a spectral feature at 450 nm
that has been attributed to absorption by crystal defects in irradiated sodium
chloride, known as F-centers. Some discrepancies exist between the laboratory
data of irradiated sodium chloride and the observations, including a $\sim$10
nm shift in central wavelength of the F-center band and the lack of the
prominent 720 nm absorption on Europa from M-centers, which result from the
coalescence of pairs of F-centers. Here, we perform irradiation experiments on
sodium chloride in an attempt to understand these discrepancies. We show that
careful control of the temperature of the sample at a temperature of 120 K
yields F-centers with an absorption wavelength comparable to that of Europa. In
addition, we measure the effect of photobleaching -- the destruction of
F-centers by photons -- and show that at the energetic particle and photon flux
on Europa, an equilibrium will be reached where only a modest F-center
absorption develops. The density of F-centers never reaches high enough values
for the creation of secondary M-centers. Our experiments predict that F-centers
grow during the night on Europa in the absence of photobleaching and then
partially decay during the daytime. We show observations from the Hubble Space
Telescope consistent with this prediction. All observations of the 450 nm
F-center on Europa are now consistent with laboratory measurements of sodium
chloride, confirming the presence of this salt on Europa.

Title:A New UV Spectral Feature on Europa: Confirmation of NaCl in Leading-hemisphere Chaos Terrain,"
Abstract:  Recent visible-wavelength observations of Europa's surface obtained with the
Hubble Space Telescope revealed the presence of an absorption feature near 450
nm that appears spatially correlated with leading-hemisphere chaos terrain.
This feature was interpreted to reflect the presence of irradiated sodium
chloride ultimately sourced from the interior. Here, we use ultraviolet spectra
also collected with the Hubble Space Telescope to detect an additional
previously unseen absorption near 230 nm, which spatially correlates with the
450 nm feature and with the same leading-hemisphere chaos terrain. We find that
the new ultraviolet feature is also well-matched by irradiated sodium chloride
at Europa-like conditions. Such confirmation of sodium chloride within
geologically young regions has important implications for Europa's subsurface
composition.

Title:The mid-UV spectrum of irradiated NaCl at Europa-like conditions,"
Abstract:  Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope show a mid-UV absorption
feature localized to leading hemisphere chaos regions on Europa. The same
regions were previously found to have a visible absorption at 450 nm that was
attributed to the presence of irradiated NaCl. The lack of any additional
diagnostic absorptions for NaCl in the visible spectrum of these terrains made
confirmation of this identification difficult. Here we use laboratory
experiments to show that NaCl irradiated at Europa's surface temperatures
develops an absorption at $\sim$220 nm consistent with the new detection in
Europa's mid-UV spectrum, strongly supporting the NaCl identification.
Irradiated NaCl in leading-hemisphere chaos terrain would suggest that sodium
and chlorine are important components of Europa's subsurface ocean.

Title:An Optical Spectrum of the Diffuse Galactic Light from BOSS and IRIS,"
Abstract:  We present a spectrum of the diffuse Galactic light (DGL) between 3700 and
10,000 A, obtained by correlating optical sky intensity with far-infrared dust
emission. We use nearly 250,000 blank-sky spectra from BOSS/SDSS-III together
with IRIS-reprocessed maps from the IRAS satellite. The larger sample size
compared to SDSS-II results in a factor-of-two increase in signal to noise. We
combine these data sets with a model for the optical/far-infrared correlation
that accounts for self-absorption by dust. The spectral features of the DGL
agree remarkably well with features present in stellar spectra. There is
evidence for a difference in the DGL continuum between the regions covered by
BOSS in the northern and southern Galactic hemisphere. We interpret the
difference at red wavelengths as the result of a difference in stellar
populations, with mainly old stars in both regions but a higher fraction of
young stars in the south. There is also a broad excess in the southern DGL
spectrum over the prediction of a simple radiative transfer model, without a
clear counterpart in the north. We interpret this excess, centered at ~6500 A,
as evidence for luminescence in the form of extended red emission (ERE). The
observed strength of the 4000 A break indicates that at most ~7% of the
dust-correlated light at 4000 A can be due to blue luminescence. Our DGL
spectrum provides constraints on dust scattering and luminescence independent
of measurements of extinction.

Title:Inferring Astrophysical Parameters of Core-Collapse Supernovae from their Gravitational-Wave Emission,"
Abstract:  Nearby core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are powerful multi-messenger sources
for gravitational-wave, neutrino and electromagnetic telescopes as they emit
gravitational waves in the ideal frequency band for ground based detectors.
Once a CCSN gravitational-wave signal is detected, we will need to determine
the parameters of the signal, and understand how those parameters relate to the
source's explosion, progenitor and remnant properties. This is a challenge due
to the stochastic nature of CCSN explosions, which is imprinted on their time
series gravitational waveforms. In this paper, we perform Bayesian parameter
estimation of CCSN signals using an asymmetric chirplet signal model to
represent the dominant high-frequency mode observed in spectrograms of CCSN
gravitational-wave signals. We use design sensitivity Advanced LIGO noise and
CCSN waveforms from four different hydrodynamical supernova simulations with a
range of different progenitor stars. We determine how well our model can
reconstruct time-frequency images of the emission modes, and show how well we
can determine parameters of the signal such as the frequency, amplitude, and
duration. We show how the parameters of our signal model may allow us to place
constraints on the proto-neutron star mass and radius, the turbulent kinetic
energy onto the proto-neutron star, and the time of shock revival.

Title:Isolated Massive Star Formation in G28.20-0.05,"
Abstract:  We report high-resolution 1.3~mm continuum and molecular line observations of
the massive protostar G28.20-0.05 with ALMA. The continuum image reveals a
ring-like structure with 2,000~au radius, similar to morphology seen in
archival 1.3~cm VLA observations. Based on its spectral index and associated
H$30\alpha$ emission, this structure mainly traces ionised gas. However, there
is evidence for $\sim30$~M$_{\odot}$ of dusty gas near the main mm continuum
peak on one side of the ring, as well as in adjacent regions within 3,000~au. A
virial analysis on scales of $\sim$2,000~au from hot core line emission yields
a dynamical mass of $\sim80\:M_\odot$. A strong velocity gradient in the
H$30\alpha$ emission is evidence for a rotating, ionized disk wind, which
drives a larger-scale molecular outflow. An infrared SED analysis indicates a
current protostellar mass of $m_*\sim40\:M_\odot$ forming from a core with
initial mass $M_c\sim300\:M_\odot$ in a clump with mass surface density of
$\Sigma_{\rm cl}\sim 0.8\:{\rm g\:cm}^{-2}$. Thus the SED and other properties
of the system can be understood in the context of core accretion models.
Structure-finding analysis on the larger-scale continuum image indicates
G28.20-0.05 is forming in a relatively isolated environment, with no other
concentrated sources, i.e., protostellar cores, above $\sim 1\:M_\odot$ found
from $\sim$0.1 to 0.4~pc around the source. This implies that a massive star
can form in relative isolation and the dearth of other protostellar companions
within the $\sim1$~pc environs is a strong constraint on massive star formation
theories that predict the presence of a surrounding protocluster.

Title:The MAVERIC Survey: The first radio and X-ray limits on the detached black holes in NGC 3201,"
Abstract:  The Galactic globular cluster NGC 3201 is the first Galactic globular cluster
observed to host dynamically-confirmed stellar-mass black holes, containing two
confirmed and one candidate black hole. This result indicates that globular
clusters can retain black holes, which has important implications for globular
cluster evolution. NGC 3201 has been observed as part of the MAVERIC survey of
Galactic globular clusters. We use these data to confirm that there is no radio
or X-ray detection of the three black holes, and present the first radio and
X-ray limits on these sources. These limits indicate that any accretion present
is at an extremely low rate and may be extremely inefficient. In particular,
for the system ACS ID #21859, by assuming the system is tidally locked and any
accretion is through the capture of the companion's winds, we constrain the
radiative efficiency of any accretion to $\leq1.5\times10^{-5}$. We also
combine the radio and X-ray source catalogues from the MAVERIC survey with the
existing MUSE spectroscopic surveys and the HUGS catalogue of NGC 3201 to
provide a catalogue of 42 multiwavelength sources in this cluster. We identify
a new red straggler source with X-ray emission, and investigate the
multiwavelength properties of the sub-subgiant population in the cluster.

Title:Collisions of young disc galaxies in the early universe,"
Abstract:  In the local universe, disc galaxies are generally well evolved and Toomre
stable. Their collisions with satellite galaxies naturally produce ring
structures, which has been observed and extensively studied. In contrast, at
high redshifts, disc galaxies are still developing and clumpy. These young
galaxies interact with each other more frequently. However, the products of
their collisions remain elusive. Here we systematically study the minor
collisions between a clumpy galaxy and a satellite on orbits with different
initial conditions, and find a new structure that is different from the local
collisional ring galaxies. The clumpness of the target galaxy is fine-tuned by
the values of Toomre parameter, $Q$. Interestingly, a thick and knotty ring
structure is formed without any sign of a central nucleus in the target galaxy.
Our results provide a promising explanation of the empty ring galaxy recently
observed in R5519 at redshift $z=2.19$. Moreover, we show that the clumpy state
of the collided galaxy exists for a much longer timescale, compared to isolated
self-evolved clumpy galaxies that have been widely investigated.

Title:Dust entrainment in magnetically and thermally driven disk winds,"
Abstract:  Magnetically and thermally driven disk winds have gained popularity in the
light of the current paradigm of low viscosities in protoplanetary disks that
nevertheless present large accretion rates even in the presence of inner
cavities. The possibility of dust entrainment in these winds may explain recent
scattered light observations and constitutes a way of dust transport towards
outer regions of the disk. We aim to study the dust dynamics in these winds and
explore the differences between photoevaporation and magnetically driven disk
winds in this regard. We quantify maximum entrainable grain sizes, the flow
angle, and the general detectability. We used the FARGO3D code to perform
global, 2.5D axisymmetric, nonideal MHD simulations including ohmic and
ambipolar diffusion. Dust was treated as a pressureless fluid. Synthetic
observations were created with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D. We find a
significant difference in the dust entrainment efficiency of warm, ionized
winds such as photoevaporation and magnetic winds including X-ray and extreme
ultraviolet (XEUV) heating compared to cold magnetic winds. The maximum
entrainable grain size varies from $3\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ to $6\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ for
ionized winds to $1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ for cold magnetic winds. Dust grains in
cold magnetic winds tend to flow along a shallower angle compared to the warm
winds. With increasing distance to the central star, the dust entrainment
efficiency decreases. Larger values of the turbulent viscosity increase the
maximum grain size radius of possible dust entrainment. Our simulations
indicate that diminishing dust content in the outer regions of the wind can be
mainly attributed to the dust settling in the disk. In the synthetic images,
the dusty wind appears as a faint, conical emission region which is brighter
for a cold magnetic wind.

Title:Novel framework for the three-dimensional NLTE inverse problem,"
Abstract:  The inversion of spectropolarimetric observations of the solar upper
atmosphere is one of the most challenging goals in solar physics. If we account
for all relevant ingredients of the spectral line formation process, such as
the three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer out of local thermodynamic
equilibrium (NLTE), the task becomes extremely computationally expensive.
Instead of generalizing 1D methods to 3D, we have developed a new approach to
the inverse problem. In our meshfree method, we do not consider the requirement
of 3D\,NLTE consistency as an obstacle, but as a natural regularization with
respect to the traditional pixel-by-pixel methods. This leads to more robust
and less ambiguous solutions. We solve the 3D\,NLTE inverse problem as an
unconstrained global minimization problem that avoids repetitive evaluations of
the $\Lambda$ operator. Apart from the 3D\,NLTE consistency, the method allows
us to easily include additional conditions of physical consistency such as the
zero divergence of the magnetic field. Stochastic ingredients make the method
less prone to ending up within the local minima of the loss function. Our
method is capable of solving the inverse problem faster by several orders of
magnitude than by using grid-based methods. The method can provide accurate and
physically consistent results if sufficient computing time is available, along
with approximate solutions in the case of very complex plasma structures or
limited computing time.

Title:Empirical relations between the intensities of Lyman lines of H and He$^+$,"
Abstract:  Empirical relations between major UV and extreme UV spectral lines are one of
the inputs for models of chromospheric and coronal spectral radiances and
irradiances. They are also needed for the interpretation of some of the
observations of the Solar Orbiter mission. We aim to determine an empirical
relation between the intensities of the HI 121.6 nm and HeII 30.4 nm Lyman
$\alpha$ lines. Images at 121.6 nm from the Chromospheric Lyman Alpha Spectro
Polarimeter (CLASP) and Multiple XUV Imager (MXUVI) sounding rockets were
co-registered with simultaneous images at 30.4 nm from the EIT and AIA orbital
telescopes in order to derive a spatially resolved relationship between the
intensities. We have obtained a relationship between the HI 121.6 nm and HeII
30.4 nm intensities that is valid for a wide range of solar features,
intensities, and activity levels. Additional SUMER data have allowed the
derivation of another relation between the HI 102.5 nm (Ly$\beta$) and HeII
30.4 nm lines for quiet-Sun regions. We combined these two relationships to
obtain a Ly$\alpha$/Ly$\beta$ intensity ratio that is comparable to the few
previously published results. The relationship between the HI 121.6~nm and HeII
30.4 nm lines is consistent with the one previously obtained using irradiance
data. We have also observed that this relation is stable in time but that its
accuracy depends on the spatial resolution of the observations. The derived
Ly$\alpha$/Ly$\beta$ intensity ratio is also compatible with previous results.

Abstract:  The advent of asteroseismology as the golden path to precisely characterize
single stars naturally led to synergies with the field of exoplanetology.
Today, the precise determination of stellar masses, radii and ages for
exoplanet-host stars is a driving force in the development of dedicated
software and techniques to achieve this goal. However, as various approaches
exist, it is clear that they all have advantages and inconveniences and that
there is a trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the
techniques. We aim to compare and discuss various modelling techniques for
exoplanet-host red giant stars for which TESS data are available. The results
of the seismic modelling are then used to study the dynamical evolution and
atmospheric evaporation of the planetary systems. We study, in detail, the
robustness, accuracy and precision of various seismic modelling techniques when
applied to four exoplanet-host red giants observed by TESS. We discuss the use
of global seismic indexes, the use of individual radial frequencies and that of
non-radial oscillations. In each case, we discuss the advantages and
inconveniences of the modelling technique. We determine precise and accurate
masses of exoplanet-host red giant stars orbited by long-period Jupiter-like
planets using various modelling techniques. For each target, we also provide a
model-independent estimate of the mass from a mean density inversion combined
with radii values from Gaia and spectroscopic data. We show that no engulfment
or migration is observed for these targets, even if their evolution is extended
beyond their estimated seismic ages up the red giant branch.

Title:Optical line spectra of tidal disruption events from reprocessing in optically thick outflows,"
Abstract:  A significant number of tidal disruption events (TDEs) radiate primarily at
optical and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, with only weak soft X-ray components.
One model for this optical excess proposes that thermal X-ray emission from a
compact accretion disc is reprocessed to longer wavelengths by an optically
thick envelope. Here, we explore this reprocessing scenario in the context of
an optically thick accretion disc wind. Using state-of-the-art Monte Carlo
radiative transfer and ionization software, we produce synthetic UV and optical
spectra for wind and disc-hosting TDEs. Our models are inspired by
observations, spanning a realistic range of accretion rates and wind
kinematics. We find that such outflows can efficiently reprocess the disc
emission and produce the broad Balmer and helium recombination features
commonly seen in TDEs and exhibit asymmetric red wings. Moreover, the
characteristic colour temperature of the reprocessed spectral energy
distribution (SED) is much lower than that of the accretion disc. We show
explicitly how changes in black hole mass, accretion rate and wind properties
affect the observed broadband SED and line spectrum. In general, slower, denser
winds tend to reprocess more radiation and produce stronger Balmer emission.
Most of the outflows we consider are too highly ionized to produce UV
absorption features, but this is sensitive to the input SED. For example,
truncating the inner disc at just 4 $R_{ISCO}$ lowers the wind ionization state
sufficiently to produce UV absorption features for sight lines looking into the
wind

Title:AMICO galaxy clusters in KiDS-DR3: Measurement of the halo bias and power spectrum normalization from a stacked weak lensing analysis,"
Abstract:  Galaxy clusters are biased tracers of the underlying matter density field. At
very large radii beyond about 10 Mpc/\textit{h}, the shear profile shows
evidence of a second-halo term. This is related to the correlated matter
distribution around galaxy clusters and proportional to the so-called halo
bias. We present an observational analysis of the halo bias-mass relation based
on the AMICO galaxy cluster catalog, comprising around 7000 candidates detected
in the third release of the KiDS survey. We split the cluster sample into 14
redshift-richness bins and derive the halo bias and the virial mass in each bin
by means of a stacked weak lensing analysis. The observed halo bias-mass
relation and the theoretical predictions based on the $\Lambda$CDM standard
cosmological model show an agreement within $2\sigma$. The mean measurements of
bias and mass over the full catalog give $M_{200c} = (4.9 \pm 0.3) \times
10^{13} M_{\odot}/\textit{h}$ and $b_h \sigma_8^2 = 1.2 \pm 0.1$. With the
additional prior of a bias-mass relation from numerical simulations, we
constrain the normalization of the power spectrum with a fixed matter density
$\Omega_m = 0.3$, finding $\sigma_8 = 0.63 \pm 0.10$.

means of radial-velocity measurements, seismic characterisation of the

High-resolution spectra of HD 29399 were acquired with the CORALIE spectrograph
mounted on the 1.2- m Swiss telescope located at La Silla Observatory (Chile)
as part of the CASCADES survey. We used the moments of the cross-correlation
function profile as well as the photometric variability of the star as
diagnostics to distinguish between stellar and planetary-induced signals. To
model the host star we combined forward modelling with global and local
minimisation approaches and inversion techniques. We also studied the orbital
history of the system under the effects of both dynamical and equilibrium
tides. Results. We present the detection of a long-period giant planet.
Combining these measurements with photometric observations by TESS, we are able
to thoroughly model the host star and study the orbital evolution of the
system. We derive stellar and planetary masses of $1.17 \pm 0.10~ M_{\odot}$
and $1.59 \pm 0.08 ~M_{Jup}$, respectively, and an age for the system of 6.2
Gyr. We show that neither dynamical nor equilibrium tides have been able to
affect the orbital evolution of the planet. Moreover, no engulfment is

Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy catalogue. In the inner Galactic
plane ($|l| < 60^\circ$), we identify 163 large-scale filaments with physical
properties derived, including dense gas mass fraction, and compare them with an
updated spiral arm model in position-position-velocity space. Dense gas mass
fraction is found not to differ significantly in various Galactic position,
neither does it in different spiral arms. We also find that most filaments are
inter-arm filaments after adding a distance constraint, and filaments in arm
differ a little with those not in. One surprising result is that clumps on and
off filaments have no significant distinction in their mass at the same size.

Title:Features of the Dynamical Evolution of a Massive Disk of Trans-Neptunian Objects,"
Abstract:  Dynamical features of a massive disk of distant trans-Neptunian objects are
considered in the model of the formation of small bodies in the Hill region of
a giant gas-dust clump that arose as a result of gravitational instability and
fragmentation of the protoplanetary disk. The dynamical evolution of orbits of
small bodies under the action of gravitational perturbations from the outer
planets and self-gravity of the disk has been studied for a time interval of
the order of a billion years. It is shown that the secular effects of the
gravitational action of a massive disk of small bodies lead to an increase in
the eccentricities of the orbits of individual objects. The result of this
dynamical behavior is the creation of a flux of small bodies coming close to
the orbit of Neptune. The change in the number of objects surviving in the
observable region of distant trans-Neptunian objects (the region of orbits with
perihelion distances of 40 < q < 80 AU and semimajor axes 150 < a < 1000 AU),
over time depends on the initial mass of the disk. For disks with masses
exceeding several Earth masses, there is a tendency to a decrease in the number
of distant trans-Neptunian objects surviving in the observable region after
evolution for a time interval of the order of the age of the Solar system, with
an increase in the initial mass. On the other hand, for most objects, orbital
eccentricities decrease under the influence of the self-gravity of the disk.
Therefore, the main part of the disk remains in the region of heliocentric
distances exceeding 100 AU.

allows to study galaxies mass assembly, formation and evolution. However, in
the lack of spectroscopic information detecting UCDs/GCs using imaging data is
very uncertain. Here, we aim to train a machine learning model to separate
these objects from the foreground stars and background galaxies using the
multi-wavelength imaging data of the Fornax galaxy cluster in 6 filters, namely
u, g, r, i, J and Ks. The classes of objects are highly imbalanced which is
problematic for many automatic classification techniques. Hence, we employ
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling to handle the imbalance of the training data.
Then, we compare two classifiers, namely Localized Generalized Matrix Learning
Vector Quantization (LGMLVQ) and Random Forest (RF). Both methods are able to
identify UCDs/GCs with a precision and a recall of >93 percent and provide
relevances that reflect the importance of each feature dimension %(colors and
angular sizes) for the classification. Both methods detect angular sizes as
important markers for this classification problem. While it is astronomical
expectation that color indices of u-i and i-Ks are the most important colors,
our analysis shows that colors such as g-r are more informative, potentially
because of higher signal-to-noise ratio. Besides the excellent performance the
LGMLVQ method allows further interpretability by providing the feature
importance for each individual class, class-wise representative samples and the
possibility for non-linear visualization of the data as demonstrated in this
contribution. We conclude that employing machine learning techniques to
identify UCDs/GCs can lead to promising results.

Title:On the trail of a comet's tail: A particle tracking algorithm for comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,"
Abstract:  Context. During the post-perihelion phase of the European Space Agency's
Rosetta mission to comet 67P, the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote
Imaging System on board the spacecraft took numerous image sequences of the
near-nucleus coma, with many showing the motion of individual pieces of debris
ejected from active surface areas into space.
Aims. We aim to track the motion of individual particles in these image
sequences and derive their projected velocities and accelerations. This should
help us to constrain their point of origin on the surface, understand the
forces that influence their dynamics in the inner coma, and predict whether
they will fall back to the surface or escape to interplanetary space.
Methods. We have developed an algorithm that tracks the motion of particles
appearing as point sources in image sequences. Our algorithm employs a point
source detection software to locate the particles and then exploits the image
sequences' pair-nature to reconstruct the particle tracks and derive the
projected velocities and accelerations. We also constrained the particle size
from their brightness.
Results. Our algorithm identified 2268 tracks in a sample image sequence.
Manual inspection not only found that 1187 (~52%) of them are likely genuine,
but in combination with runs on simulated data it also revealed a simple
criterion related to the completeness of a track to single out a large subset
of the genuine tracks without the need for manual intervention. A tentative
analysis of a small (n = 89) group of particles exemplifies how our data can be
used, and provides first results on the particles' velocity, acceleration, and
radius distributions, which agree with previous work.

Title:Convolutional Neural Network-reconstructed velocity for kinetic SZ detection,"
Abstract:  We report the detection of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect in
galaxy clusters with a 4.9 sigma significance using the latest 217 GHz Planck
map from data release 4. For the detection, we stacked the Planck map at the
positions of 30,431 galaxy clusters from the Wen-Han-Liu (WHL) catalog. To
align the sign of the kSZ signals, the line-of-sight velocities of galaxy
clusters were estimated with a machine-learning approach, in which the relation
between the galaxy distribution around a cluster and its line-of-sight velocity
was trained through a convolutional neural network. To train our network, we
used the simulated galaxies and galaxy clusters in the Magneticum cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations. The trained model was applied to the large-scale
distribution of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies to derive the
line-of-sight velocities of the WHL galaxy clusters. Assuming a standard
beta-model for the intracluster medium, we obtained the gas mass fraction in
R500 to be fgas,500 = 0.09 +- 0.02 within the galaxy clusters with the average
mass of M500 ~ 1.0 x 10^14 Msun/h.

Title:Do we need to consider electron kinetic effects to properly model a planetary magnetosphere: the case of Mercury,"
Abstract:  The magnetosphere of Mercury is studied using an implicit full particle in
cell simulation (PIC). We use a hybrid simulation where ions are full particles
and electrons are considered as a fluid to start a full PIC simulation where
electrons are also particles and follow their distribution function. This
approach allows us to estimate the changes introduced by the electron kinetic
physics. We find that the overall macroscopic state of the magnetosphere of
Mercury is little affected but several physical processes are significantly
modified in the full PIC simulation: the foreshock region is more active with
more intense shock reformation, the Kelvin-Helmholtz rippling effects on the
nightside magnetopause are sharper, and the magnetotail current sheet becomes
thinner than those predicted by the hybrid simulation. The greatest effect of
the electron physics, comes from the processes of particle energization. Both
species, not just the electrons, are found to gain more energy when kinetic
electron processes are taken into account. The region with the most energetic
plasma is found on the dusk side of the tail where magnetic flux ropes are
formed due to reconnection. We find that the ion and electron energization is
associated with the regions of reconnection and the development of kinetic
instabilities caused by counter-streaming electron populations. The resulting
electron distributions are highly non Maxwellian, a process that neither MHD
nor hybrid models can describe.

Title:Percent-level constraints on baryonic feedback with spectral distortion measurements,"
Abstract:  High-significance measurements of the monopole thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich CMB
spectral distortions have the potential to tightly constrain poorly understood
baryonic feedback processes. The sky-averaged Compton-y distortion and its
relativistic correction are measures of the total thermal energy in electrons
in the observable universe and their mean temperature. We use the CAMELS suite
of hydrodynamic simulations to explore possible constraints on parameters
describing the subgrid implementation of feedback from active galactic nuclei
and supernovae, assuming a PIXIE-like measurement. The small 25 Mpc/h CAMELS
boxes present challenges due to the significant cosmic variance. We utilize
machine learning to construct interpolators through the noisy simulation data.
Using the halo model, we translate the simulation halo mass functions into
correction factors to reduce cosmic variance where required. Our results depend
on the subgrid model. In the case of IllustrisTNG, we find that the
best-determined parameter combination can be measured to ~2% and corresponds to
a product of AGN and SN feedback. In the case of SIMBA, the tightest constraint
is ~0.2% on a ratio between AGN and SN feedback. A second orthogonal parameter
combination can be measured to ~8%. Our results demonstrate the significant
constraining power a measurement of the late-time spectral distortion monopoles
would have for baryonic feedback models.

Title:Adiabatic-radiative shock systems in YSO jets and novae outflows,"
Abstract:  The termination regions of non-relativistic jets in protostars and supersonic
outflows in classical novae are nonthermal emitters. Given the high densities
in these systems, radiative shocks are expected to form. However, in the
presence of high velocities, the formation of adiabatic shocks is also
possible. A case of interest is when the two types of shocks occur
simultaneously. These dense jets/outflows are excellent candidates for
laboratory experiments as demonstrated by MHD scaling. We aim at studying the
combination of adiabatic and radiative shocks in these systems. We focus on
determining the conditions under which this combination is feasible together
with its physical implications. We perform an analytical study of the shocks in
both types of sources for a set of parameters. The hydrodynamical evolution of
a jet colliding with an ambient medium is studied with 2D numerical simulations
confirming our initial theoretical estimates. We show that for a wide set of
parameters the combination of an adiabatic and a radiative shock is possible at
the working surface of the termination region in jets from young stars and
novae outflows. We find that instabilities are developed at the contact
discontinuity, mixing the shocked materials. Also, we explore the MHD parameter
scaling required for studying protostellar jets and novae outflows using
laboratory experiments on laser facilities. The coexistence of an adiabatic and
a radiative shock is expected at the termination region of protostellar jets
and novae outflows. This scenario is very promising for particle acceleration
and gamma-ray emission. The parameters for scaled laboratory experiments are
very much in line with plasma conditions achievable in currently operating
high-power laser facilities. This opens the door to new means for studying
novae outflows never considered before.

Title:TIC-320687387 B: a long-period eclipsing M-dwarf close to the hydrogen burning limit,"
Abstract:  We are using precise radial velocities from CORALIE together with precision
photometry from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) to follow up stars
with single-transit events detected with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS). As part of this survey we identified a single transit on the
star TIC-320687387, a bright (T=11.6) G-dwarf observed by TESS in Sector 13 and
27. From subsequent monitoring of TIC-320687387 with CORALIE, NGTS, and Lesedi
we determined that the companion, TIC-320687387 B,is a very low-mass star with
a mass of $96.2 \pm _{2.0}^{1.9} M_J$ and radius of $1.14 \pm _{0.02}^{0.02}
R_J$ placing it close to the hydrogen burning limit ($\sim 80 M_J$).
TIC-320687387 B has a wide and eccentric orbit, with a period of 29.77381 days
and an eccentricity of $0.366 \pm 0.003$. Eclipsing systems such as
TIC-320687387 AB allow us to test stellar evolution models for low-mass stars,
which in turn are needed to calculate accurate masses and radii for exoplanets
orbiting single low-mass stars. The wide orbit of TIC-320687387 B makes it
particularly valuable as its evolution can be assumed to be free from
perturbations caused by tidal interactions with its G-type host star.

Abstract:  The tidally tilted pulsators are a new type of oscillating star in close
binary systems that have their pulsation axis in the orbital plane because of
the tidal distortion caused by their companion. We describe this group of stars
on the basis of the first three representatives discovered and illustrate the
basic methods used for their analysis. Their value for astrophysical study is
rooted in the combination of the strengths of binary star and asteroseismic
analyses; pulsational mode identifications can be achieved because the
oscillations are visible over nearly 360 degrees of aspect throughout the
orbital cycle. An illustrative case of a particularly interesting system is
presented.

Title:Secular evolution of resonant small bodies: semi-analytical approach for arbitrary eccentricities in the coplanar case,"
Abstract:  We study the secular evolution of a particle in deep mean motion resonance
(MMR) with a planet in the planar elliptic restricted three body problem. We do
not consider any restriction neither in the planet's eccentricity $e_p$ nor in
the particle's eccentricity $e$. The methodology used is based on a
semi-analytical model that consists on calculating the averaged resonant
disturbing function numerically, assuming for this that in the resonant scale
of time all the orbital elements of the particle are constant. In order to
obtain the secular evolution inside the MMR, we make use of the adiabatic
invariance principle, assuming a zero-amplitude resonant libration. We
construct two-dimensional surfaces (called $\mathcal{H}$ surfaces) in the
three-dimensional space $(\sigma, e, \varpi)$ that allow us to predict the
secular evolution of these three variables. The 2:1 MMR is used as example to
show some results. We found four apsidal corotation resonance (ACR) families,
two symmetric and two asymmetric. One of the symmetric families exists for
almost any $e_p$ value. The other one for $e_p>0.3$ and the asymmetric ones for
$e_p>0.44$. We corroborate the secular variations in $e$ and $\varpi$ predicted
by the model through numerical integrations even when the initial conditions
are displaced from those ACR. Some peculiar examples are presented for the 3:1
and 3:2 MMR showing large excursions in eccentricity. As an application, the
Planet 9 is investigated as a possible responsible of high eccentric distant
TNOs.

Title:Influence of the projectile geometry on the momentum transfer from a kinetic impactor and implications for the DART mission,"
Abstract:  The DART spacecraft will impact Didymos's secondary, Dimorphos, at the end of
2022 and cause a change in the orbital period of the secondary. For simplicity,
most previous numerical simulations of the impact used a spherical projectile
geometry to model the DART spacecraft. To investigate the effects of
alternative, simple projectile geometries on the DART impact outcome we used
the iSALE shock physics code in two and thee-dimensions to model vertical
impacts of projectiles with a mass and speed equivalent to the nominal DART
impact, into porous basalt targets. We found that the simple projectile
geometries investigated here have minimal effects on the crater morphology and
momentum enhancement. Projectile geometries modelled in two-dimensions that
have similar surface areas at the point of impact, affect the crater radius and
the crater volume by less than 5%. In the case of a more extreme projectile
geometry (i.e., a rod, modelled in three-dimensions), the crater was elliptical
and 50% shallower compared to the crater produced by a spherical projectile of
the same momentum. The momentum enhancement factor in these test cases,
commonly referred to as beta, was within 7% for the 2D simulations and within
10% for the 3D simulations, of the value obtained for a uniform spherical
projectile. The most prominent effects of projectile geometry are seen in the
ejection velocity as a function of launch position and ejection angle of the
fast ejecta that resides in the so-called `coupling zone'. These results will
inform the LICIACube ejecta cone analysis.

Title:Annotating TAP responses on-the-fly against an IVOA data model,"
Abstract:  With the success and widespread of the IVOA Table Access Protocol (1) for
discovering and querying tabular data in astronomy, more than one hundred of
TAP services exposing altogether 22 thousands of tables are accessible from the
IVOA Registries at the time of writing. Currently the TAP protocol presents
table data and metadata via a {TAP\_SCHEMA} describing the served tables with
their columns and possible joins between them. We explore here how to add an
information layer, so that values within table columns can be gathered and used
to populate instances of objects defined in a selected IVOA data model like
Photometry, Coords, Measure, Transform or the proposed MANGO container model.
This information layer is provided through annotation tags which tell how the
columns' values can be interpreted as attributes of instances of that model.
Then when a TAP query is processed, our server add-on interprets the ADQL query
string and produces on-the-fly, when possible, the TAP response as an annotated
VOTable document. The FIELD elements in the table response are mapped to
corresponding model elements templated for this service. This has been
prototyped in Java, using the VOLLT package library and a template annotation
document representing elements from the MANGO data model. This has been
exercised on examples based on Vizier and Chandra catalogs.

Title:The complex globular cluster system of the S0 galaxy NGC 4382 in the outskirts of the Virgo Cluster,"
Abstract:  NGC 4382 is a merger-remnant galaxy that has been classified as morphological
type E2, S0, and even Sa. In this work, we performed a photometric and
spectroscopic analysis of the globular cluster (GC) system of this peculiar
galaxy in order to provide additional information about its history. We used a
combination of photometric data in different filters, and multi-object and
long-slit spectroscopic data obtained using the Gemini/GMOS instrument. The
photometric analysis of the GC system, using the Gaussian Mixture Model
algorithm in the colour plane, reveals a complex colour distribution within
$R_\mathrm{gal}<5$ arcmin (26.1 kpc), showing four different groups: the
typical blue and red subpopulations, a group with intermediate colours, and the
fourth group towards even redder colours. From the spectroscopic analysis of 47
GCs, confirmed members of NGC\,4382 based on radial velocities, we verified 3
of the 4 photometric groups from the analysis of their stellar populations
using the ULySS code. NGC 4382 presents the classic blue ($10.4\pm2.8$ Gyr,
$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-1.48\pm0.18$ dex) and red ($12.1\pm2.3$ Gyr,
$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-0.64\pm0.26$ dex) GCs formed earlier in the lifetime of the
galaxy, and a third group of young GCs ($2.2\pm0.9$ Gyr;
$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-0.05\pm0.28$ dex). Finally, analysis of long-slit data of the
galaxy reveals a luminosity-weighted mean age for the stellar population of
$\sim$2.7 Gyr, and an increasing metallicity from [Fe/H]=$-0.1$ to $+0.2$ dex
in $R_\mathrm{gal}<10$ arcsec (0.87 kpc). These values, and other morphological
signatures in the galaxy, are in good agreement with the younger group of GCs,
indicating a common origin as a result of a recent merger.

Title:Phase-resolved spectroscopy of a quasi-periodic oscillation in the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105 with NICER and NuSTAR,"
Abstract:  Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are often present in the X-ray flux from
accreting stellar-mass black holes (BHs). If they are due to relativistic
(Lense-Thirring) precession of an inner accretion flow which is misaligned with
the disc, the iron emission line caused by irradiation of the disc by the inner
flow will rock systematically between red and blue shifted during each QPO
cycle. Here we conduct phase-resolved spectroscopy of a $\sim2.2$ Hz type-C QPO
from the BH X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, observed simultaneously with NICER and
NuSTAR. We apply a tomographic model in order to constrain the QPO
phase-dependent illumination profile of the disc. We detect the predicted QPO
phase-dependent shifts of the iron line centroid energy, with our best fit
featuring an asymmetric illumination profile ($>2{\sigma}$ confidence). The
observed line energy shifts can alternatively be explained by the spiral
density waves of the accretion-ejection instability model. However we
additionally measure a significant ($>3{\sigma}$) modulation in reflection
fraction, strongly favouring a geometric QPO origin. We infer that the disc is
misaligned with previously observed jet ejections, which is consistent with the
model of a truncated disc with an inner precessing hot flow. However our
inferred disc inner radius is small ($r_\text{in}{\sim} 1.4 GM/c^2$). For this
disc inner radius, Lense-Thirring precession cannot reproduce the observed QPO
frequency. In fact, this disc inner radius is incompatible with the predictions
of all well-studied QPO models in the literature.

Title:Observational hints on the torus obscuring gas behaviour through X-rays with NuSTAR data,"
Abstract:  According to theory, the torus of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is sustained
from a wind coming off the accretion disk, and for low efficient AGN, it has
been proposed that such structure disappears. However, the exact conditions for
its disappearance remain unclear. This can be studied throughout the reflection
component at X-rays, which is associated with distant and neutral material at
the inner walls of the torus in obscured AGN. We select a sample of 81 AGNs
observed with NuSTAR with a distance limit of D< 200\,Mpc and Eddington rate
$\rm{\lambda_{Edd} \equiv L_{bol}/L_{Edd}<10^{-3}}$. We fit the 3-70\,keV
spectra using a model accounting for a partial-covering absorber plus a
reflection component from neutral material. We find that the existence of the
reflection component spans in a wide range of black-hole mass and bolometric
luminosities, with only $\sim$13\% of our sample (11 sources) lacking of any
reflection signatures. These sources fall in the region in which the torus may
be lacking in the L-MBH diagram. For the sources with a detected reflection
component, we find that the vast majority of them are highly obscured
($\rm{\log \ N_H > 23}$), with $\rm{\sim 20\%}$ being Compton-thick. We also
find an increase on the number of unobscured sources and a tentative increase
on the ratio between $\rm{FeK\alpha}$ emission line and Compton-hump
luminosities toward $\rm{\lambda_{Edd}=10^{-5}}$, suggesting that the
contribution of the $\rm{FeK\alpha}$ line changes with Eddington ratio.

Title:Cluster assembly and the origin of mass segregation in the STARFORGE simulations,"
Abstract:  Stars form in dense, clustered environments, where feedback from newly formed
stars eventually ejects the gas, terminating star formation and leaving behind
one or more star clusters. Using the STARFORGE simulations, it is possible to
simulate this process in its entirety within a molecular cloud, while
explicitly evolving the gas radiation and magnetic fields and following the
formation of individual, low-mass stars. We find that individual star-formation
sites merge to form ever larger structures, while still accreting gas. Thus
clusters are assembled through a series of mergers. During the cluster assembly
process a small fraction of stars are ejected from their clusters; we find no
significant difference between the mass distribution of the ejected stellar
population and that of stars inside clusters. The star-formation sites that are
the building blocks of clusters start out mass segregated with one or a few
massive stars at their center. As they merge the newly formed clusters maintain
this feature, causing them to have mass-segregated substructures without
themselves being centrally condensed. The merged clusters relax to a centrally
condensed mass segregated configuration through dynamical interactions between
their members, but this process does not finish before feedback expels the
remaining gas from the cluster. In the simulated runs the gas-free clusters
then become unbound and break up. We find that turbulent driving and a periodic
cloud geometry can significantly reduce clustering and prevent gas expulsion.
Meanwhile, the initial surface density and level of turbulence have little
qualitative effect on cluster evolution, despite the significantly different
star formation histories.

Title:Redshifted methanol absorption tracing infall motions of high-mass star formation regions,"
Abstract:  Gravitational collapse is one of the most important processes in high-mass
star formation. Compared with the classic blue-skewed profiles, redshifted
absorption against continuum emission is a more reliable method to detect
inward motions within high-mass star formation regions. We aim to test if
methanol transitions can be used to trace infall motions within high-mass star
formation regions. Using the Effelsberg-100 m, IRAM-30 m, and APEX-12 m
telescopes, we carried out observations of 37 and 16 methanol transitions
towards two well-known collapsing dense clumps, W31C (G10.6-0.4) and W3(OH), to
search for redshifted absorption features or inverse P-Cygni profiles.
Redshifted absorption is observed in 14 and 11 methanol transitions towards
W31C and W3(OH), respectively. The infall velocities fitted from a simple
two-layer model agree with previously reported values derived from other
tracers, suggesting that redshifted methanol absorption is a reliable tracer of
infall motions within high-mass star formation regions. Our observations
indicate the presence of large-scale inward motions, and the mass infall rates
are roughly estimated to be $\gtrsim$10$^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, which
supports the global hierarchical collapse and clump-fed scenario. With the aid
of bright continuum sources and the overcooling of methanol transitions leading
to enhanced absorption, redshifted methanol absorption can trace infall motions
within high-mass star formation regions hosting bright H{\scriptsize II}
regions.

sub-Neptune-sized planet occurrence with decreasing host mass continues into

Title:Estimating the local dark matter density in a non-axisymmetric wobbling disc,"
Abstract:  The density of dark matter near the Sun is important for experiments hunting
for dark matter particles in the laboratory, and for constraining the local
shape of the Milky Way's dark matter halo. Estimates to date have typically
assumed that the Milky Way's stellar disc is axisymmetric and in a
steady-state. Yet the Milky Way disc is neither, exhibiting prominent spiral
arms and a bar, and vertical and radial oscillations. We assess the impact of
these assumptions on determinations of the local dark matter density by
applying a free-form, steady-state, Jeans method to two different N-body
simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies. In one, the galaxy has experienced an
ancient major merger, similar to the hypothesized Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus; in
the other, the galaxy is perturbed more recently by the repeated passage and
slow merger of a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy. We assess the impact of each of
the terms in the Jeans-Poisson equations on our ability to correctly extract
the local dark matter density from the simulated data. We find that common
approximations employed in the literature - axisymmetry and a locally flat
rotation curve - can lead to significant systematic errors of up to a factor
~1.5 in the recovered surface mass density ~2kpc above the disc plane, implying
a fractional error on the local dark matter density of order unity. However,
once we add in the tilt term and the rotation curve term in our models, we
obtain an unbiased estimate, consistent with the true value within our 95%
confidence intervals for realistic 20% uncertainties on the baryonic surface
density of the disc. Other terms - the axial tilt, 2:nd Poisson and time
dependent terms - contribute less than 10% to the local dark matter density
(given current data) and can be safely neglected for now. In the future, as
more data become available, these terms will need to be included in the
analysis.

signals, and kilonovae. The latter are optical transients, powered by
radioactive nuclides which are synthesized when the neutron-rich ejecta of a
disrupted neutron star undergoes decompression. We model this decompression
phase using data from simulations of post-merger accretion disk winds. We use
smoothed particle hydrodynamics with realistic nuclear heating to model the
expansion over multiple scales, from initially several thousand km to billions
of km. We then render a realistic image of a kilonova ejecta as it would appear
for a nearby observer. This is the first time such a visualization is performed
using input from state-of-the-art accretion disk simulations, nuclear physics
and atomic physics. The volume rendering in our model computes an opacity
transfer function on the basis of the physical opacity, varying significantly
with the inhomogeneity of the neutron richness in the ejecta. Other physical
quantities such as temperature or electron fraction can be visualized using an
independent color transfer function. We discuss several difficulties with the
ParaView application that we encountered during the visualization process, and
give descriptions of our solutions and workarounds which could be used for
future improvements.

Title:Magnetic field sustained by the elastic force in neutron star crusts,"
Abstract:  We investigate the magneto--elastic equilibrium of a neutron star crust and
magnetic energy stored by the elastic force. The solenoidal motion driven by
the Lorentz force can be controlled by the magnetic elastic force, so that
conditions for the magnetic field strength and geometry are less restrictive.
For equilibrium models, the minor solenoidal part of the magnetic force is
balanced by a weak elastic force because the irrotational part is balanced by
the dominant gravity and pressure forces. Therefore, a strong magnetic field
may be confined in the interior, regardless of poloidal or toroidal components.
We numerically calculated axially symmetric models with the maximum
shear--strain, and found that a magnetic energy $> 10^{46}$ erg can be stored
in the crust, even for a normal surface dipole-field-strength ($<10^{13}$ G).
The magnetic energy much exceeds the elastic energy ($ 10^{44} -10^{45}$ erg).
The shear--stress spatial distribution revealed that the elastic structure is
likely to break down near the surface. In particular, the critical position is
highly localized at a depth less than 100 m from the surface.

Title:New Massive Contact Twin Binary in a Radio-quiet HII Region Associated with the M17 Complex,"
Abstract:  Early-B stars may create an HII region that appears as radio-quiet. We report
the identification of new early-B stars associated with the radio-quiet HII
region G014.645--00.606 in the M17 complex. The ratio-quiet HII region
G014.645--00.606 is adjacent to three radio-quiet WISE HII region candidates.
The ionizing sources of the radio-quiet HII regions are expected to later than
B1V, given the sensitivity about 1-2 mJy of the MAGPIS 20 cm survey. The stars
were first selected if their parallaxes of GAIA EDR3 match that of the 22 GHz
H$_2$O maser source within the same region. We used the color-magnitude diagram
made from the ZTF photometric catalog to select the candidates for massive
stars because the intrinsic $g-r$ colors of massive stars change little from
B-type to O-type stars. Five stars lie in the areas of the color-magnitude
diagram where either reddened massive stars or evolved post-main sequence stars
of lower masses are commonly found. Three of the five stars, sources 1, 2, and
3, are located at the cavities of the three IR bubbles, and extended H$\alpha$
emission is detected around the three IR bubbles. We suggest that sources 1, 2,
and 3 are candidates for early-B stars associated with the radio-quiet region
G014.645--00.606. Particularly, source 1 is an EW type eclipsing binary with a
short period of 0.825 day, while source 2 is an EA type eclipsing binary with a
short period of 0.919 day. The physical parameters of the two binary systems
have been derived through the PHOEBE model. Source 1 is a twin binary of two
stars with T~23,500 K, and source 2 contains a hotter component (T~20,100 K)
and a cooler one (T~15,500 K). The $O-C$ values of source 1 show a trend of
decline, implying that the period of the source is deceasing. Source 1 is
likely a contacting early-B twin binary, for which mass transfer might cause
its orbit to shrink.

Title:Impact of Warm Dark Matter on the Cosmic Neutrino Background Anisotropies,"
Abstract:  The Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) anisotropies for massive neutrinos
are a unique probe of large-scale structure formation. The redshift-distance
measure is completely different for massive neutrinos as compared to
electromagnetic radiation. The C$\nu$B anisotropies in massive neutrinos grow
in response to non-relativistic motion in gravitational potentials seeded by
relatively high $k$-modes. Differences in the early phases of large-scale
structure formation in Warm Dark Matter (WDM) versus Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
cosmologies have an impact on the magnitude of the C$\nu$B anisotropies for
contributions to the angular power spectrum that peak at high $k$-modes. We
take the examples of WDM consisting of 2, 3 or 7 keV sterile neutrinos and show
that the C$\nu$B anisotropies for 0.05 eV neutrinos drop off at high-$l$
multipole moment in the angular power spectrum relative to CDM. At the same
angular scales that one can observe baryonic acoustical oscillations in the
CMB, the C$\nu$B anisotropies begin to become sensitive to differences in WDM
and CDM cosmologies. The precision measurement of high-$l$ multipoles in the
C$\nu$B neutrino sky map is a potential possibility for the PTOLEMY experiment
with thin film targets of spin-polarized atomic tritium superfluid that exhibit
significant quantum liquid amplification for non-relativistic relic neutrino
capture.

Title:Divergence in mass ratio distributions between low-mass and high-mass coalescing binary black holes,"
Abstract:  Coalescing binary black hole (BBH) systems are likely formed via several
channels, and it is challenging to understand their formation / evolutionary
processes. Some features in the mass function of the primary components
($m_1$), such as the distinct Gaussian-like peak located at $\sim 34M_\odot$,
have been previously found. In this work, we investigate the possible
dependence of the mass ratio ($q=m_2/m_1$) distribution on the primary mass. We
find a Bayesian odds ratio of 18.1 in favor of divergence in the mass ratio
distributions between the low- and high-mass ranges over an invariable mass
ratio distribution. The BBHs with $m_1\gtrsim29M_{\odot}$ have a stronger
preference to be symmetric compared to those with $m_1\lesssim29M_{\odot}$ at a
97.6\% credible level. Additionally, we find mild evidence that the BBHs with
$m_1$ located in the Gaussian-like peak have a mass ratio distribution
different from that of other BBHs. Our findings may be in favor of some
formation channels, such as the chemically homogeneous evolution and the
dynamical assembly in globular clusters/nuclear star clusters, which are more
likely to provide symmetric BBHs in the high-mass range.

Title:Cosmic Ray Intensity Variation Lags Sunspot number: Implications of Late Opening of Solar Magnetic Field,"
Abstract:  Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), the highly energetic particles that may raise
critical health issues for astronauts in space, are modulated by solar activity
with their intensity lagging behind the sunspot number (SSN) variation by about
one year. Previously, this lag has been attributed to a combined effect of
outward convecting solar wind and inward propagating GCRs. However, the lag's
amplitude and its solar-cycle dependence are still not fully understood (Ross &
Chaplin, 2019). By investigating the solar surface magnetic field, we find that
the source of heliospheric magnetic field -- the open magnetic flux on the Sun,
already lags behind SSN before it convects into heliosphere along with the
solar wind. The delay during odd cycles is longer than that during sequential
even cycles. Thus, we propose that the GCR lag is primarily due to the greatly
late opening of the solar magnetic field with respect to SSN, though solar wind
convection and particle transport in the heliosphere also matter. We further
investigate the origin of the open flux from different latitudes of the Sun and
found that the total open flux is significantly contributed by that from low
latitudes where coronal mass ejections frequently occur and also show an
odd-even cyclic pattern. Our findings challenge existing theories, and may
serve as the physical basis of long-term forecasts radiation dose estimates for
manned deep-space exploration missions.

Title:Mission Design of DESTINY+: Toward Active Asteroid (3200) Phaethon and Multiple Small Bodies,"
Abstract:  DESTINY+ is an upcoming JAXA Epsilon medium-class mission to fly by the
Geminids meteor shower parent body (3200) Phaethon. It will be the world's
first spacecraft to escape from a near-geostationary transfer orbit into deep
space using a low-thrust propulsion system. In doing so, DESTINY+ will
demonstrate a number of technologies that include a highly efficient ion engine
system, lightweight solar array panels, and advanced asteroid flyby observation
instruments. These demonstrations will pave the way for JAXA's envisioned
low-cost, high-frequency space exploration plans. Following the Phaethon flyby
observation, DESTINY+ will visit additional asteroids as its extended mission.
The mission design is divided into three phases: a spiral-shaped apogee-raising
phase, a multi-lunar-flyby phase to escape Earth, and an interplanetary and
asteroids flyby phase. The main challenges include the optimization of the
many-revolution low-thrust spiral phase under operational constraints; the
design of a multi-lunar-flyby sequence in a multi-body environment; and the
design of multiple asteroid flybys connected via Earth gravity assists. This
paper shows a novel, practical approach to tackle these complex problems, and
presents feasible solutions found within the mass budget and mission
constraints. Among them, the baseline solution is shown and discussed in depth;
DESTINY+ will spend two years raising its apogee with ion engines, followed by
four lunar gravity assists, and a flyby of asteroids (3200) Phaethon and
(155140) 2005 UD. Finally, the flight operations plan for the spiral phase and
the asteroid flyby phase are presented in detail.

Title:Estimating photoevaporative mass loss of exoplanets with PLATYPOS,"
Abstract:  We develop PLATYPOS (PLAneTarY PhOtoevaporation Simulator), a python code to
perform planetary photoevaporative mass-loss calculations for close-in planets
with hydrogen-helium envelopes atop Earth-like rocky cores. With physical and
model parameters as input, PLATYPOS calculates the atmospheric mass loss and
with it the radius evolution of a planet over time, taking into account also
the thermal cooling and subsequent radius evolution of the planet. In
particular, we implement different stellar activity evolution tracks over time.
Our setup allows for a prediction of whether a planet can hold on to a
significant fraction of its atmosphere, or fully evaporates, leaving behind
only the bare rocky core. The user supplies information about the star-planet
system of interest, which includes planetary and host star parameters, as well
as the star's rotational and thus activity evolution. In addition, several
details for the evaporative mass-loss rate estimation can be chosen. This
includes the effective absorption cross-section for high energy photons, the
evaporation efficiency, and the hydrodynamic escape model.

Title:Binary companions triggering fragmentation in self-gravitating discs,"
Abstract:  Observations of systems hosting close in ($<1$ AU) giant planets and brown
dwarfs ($M\gtrsim7$ M$_{\rm Jup}$) find an excess of binary star companions,
indicating that stellar multiplicity may play an important role in their
formation. There is now increasing evidence that some of these objects may have
formed via fragmentation in gravitationally unstable discs. We present a suite
of 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of binary star systems
with circumprimary self-gravitating discs, which include a realistic
approximation to radiation transport, and extensively explore the companion's
orbital parameter space for configurations which may trigger fragmentation. We
identify a ""sweet spot"" where intermediate separation binary companions ($100$
AU $\lesssim a\lesssim400$ AU) can cause a marginally stable disc to fragment.
The exact range of ideal binary separations is a function of the companion's
eccentricity, inclination and mass. Heating is balanced by efficient cooling,
and fragmentation occurs inside a spiral mode driven by the companion. Short
separation, disc penetrating binary encounters ($a\lesssim100$ AU) are
prohibitive to fragmentation, as mass stripping and disc heating quench any
instability. This is also true of binary companions with high orbital
eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.75$). Wide separation companions ($a\gtrsim500$ AU)
have little effect on the disc properties for the setup parameters considered
here. The sweet spot found is consistent with the range of binary separations
which display an excess of close in giant planets and brown dwarfs. Hence we
suggest that fragmentation triggered by a binary companion may contribute to
the formation of these substellar objects.

Title:The ortho-to-para ratio of water in interstellar clouds,"
Abstract:  The nuclear-spin chemistry of interstellar water is investigated using the
University of Grenoble Alpes Astrochemical Network (UGAN). This network
includes reactions involving the different nuclear-spin states of the hydrides
of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, as well as their deuterated forms.
Nuclear-spin selection rules are implemented within the scrambling hypothesis
for reactions involving up to seven protons. The abundances and ortho-to-para
ratios (OPRs) of gas-phase water and water ions (H$_2$O$^+$ and H$_3$O$^+$) are
computed under the steady-state conditions representative of a dark molecular
cloud and during the early phase of gravitational collapse of a prestellar
core. The model incorporates the freezing of the molecules on to grains, simple
grain surface chemistry and cosmic-ray induced and direct desorption of ices.
The predicted OPRs are found to deviate significantly from both thermal and
statistical values and to be independent of temperature below $\sim $30~K. The
OPR of H$_2$O is shown to lie between 1.5 and 2.6, depending on the spin-state
of H$_2$, in good agreement with values derived in translucent clouds with
relatively high extinction. In the prestellar core collapse calculations, the
OPR of H$_2$O is shown to reach the statistical value of 3 in regions with
severe depletion ($n_{\rm H}> 10^7$~cm$^{-3}$). We conclude that a low water
OPR ($\lesssim 2.5$) is consistent with gas-phase ion-neutral chemistry and
reflects a gas with OPR(H$_2)\lesssim 1$. Available OPR measurements in
protoplanetary disks and comets are finally discussed.

Title:Why is it So Hot in Here? Exploring Population Trends in $\textit{Spitzer}$ Thermal Emission Observations of Hot Jupiters using Planet-Specific Self-Consistent Atmospheric Models,"
Abstract:  Thermal emission has now been observed from many dozens of exoplanet
atmospheres, opening the gateway to population-level characterization. Here, we
provide theoretical explanations for observed trends in $\textit{Spitzer}$ IRAC
channel 1 (3.6 $\mu m$) and channel 2 (4.5 $\mu m$) photometric eclipse depths
(EDs) across a population of 34 hot Jupiters. We apply planet-specific,
self-consistent atmospheric models, spanning a range of recirculation factors,
metallicities, and C/O ratios, to probe the information content of
$\textit{Spitzer}$ secondary eclipse observations across the hot-Jupiter
population. We show that most hot Jupiters are inconsistent with blackbodies
from $\textit{Spitzer}$ observations alone. We demonstrate that the majority of
hot Jupiters are consistent with low energy redistribution between the dayside
and nightside (hotter dayside than expected with efficient recirculation). We
also see that high equilibrium temperature planets (T$_{eq}$ $\ge$ 1800 K)
favor inefficient recirculation in comparison to the low temperature planets.
Our planet-specific models do not reveal any definitive population trends in
metallicity and C/O ratio with current data precision, but more than 59 % of
our sample size is consistent with the C/O ratio $\leq$ 1 and 35 % are
consistent with whole range (0.35 $\leq$ C/O $\leq$ 1.5). We also find that for
most of the planets in our sample, 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu m$ model EDs lie within
$\pm$1 $\sigma$ of the observed EDs. Intriguingly, few hot Jupiters exhibit
greater thermal emission than predicted by the hottest atmospheric models
(lowest recirculation) in our grid. Future spectroscopic observations of
thermal emission from hot Jupiters with the James Webb Space Telescope will be
necessary to robustly identify population trends in chemical compositions with
its increased spectral resolution, range and data precision.

"Title:First Combined Study on LIV from Observations of Energy-dependent Time Delays from Multiple-type Gamma-ray Sources -- Part I. Motivation, Method Description and Validation through Simulations of H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS Datasets","
Abstract:  Gamma-ray astronomy has become one of the main experimental ways to test the
modified dispersion relations (MDRs) of photons in vacuum, obtained in some
attempts to formulate a theory of Quantum Gravity. The MDRs in use imply time
delays which depend on the energy, and which increase with distance following
some function of redshift. The use of transient, or variable, distant and
highly energetic sources, already allows us to set stringent limits on the
energy scale related to this phenomenon, usually thought to be of the order of
the Planck energy, but robust conclusions on the existence of MDR-related
propagation effects still require the analysis of a large population of
sources.
In order to gather the biggest sample of sources possible for MDR searches at
teraelectronvolt energies, the H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS collaborations
enacted a joint task force to combine all their relevant data to constrain the
Quantum Gravity energy scale. In the present article, the likelihood method
used, to combine the data and provide a common limit, is described in detail
and tested through simulations of recorded data sets for a gamma-ray burst,
three flaring active galactic nuclei and two pulsars. Statistical and
systematic errors are assessed and included in the likelihood as nuisance
parameters. In addition, a comparison of two different formalisms for distance
dependence of the time lags is performed for the first time. In a second
article, to appear later, the method will be applied on all relevant data from
the three experiments.

Title:Numerical Solutions of the External Field Effect on the Radial Acceleration in Disk Galaxies,"
Abstract:  In MOND (modified Newtonian dynamics)-based theories the strong equivalence
principle is generically broken in an idiosyncratic manner, manifested in the
action of an ""external field effect (EFE)"". The internal dynamics in a
self-gravitating system is affected even by a constant external field. In disk
galaxies the EFE can induce warps and modify the rotational speeds. Due to the
non-linearity of MOND, it is difficult to derive analytic expressions of this
important effect in a disk. Here we study numerically the EFE in two
non-relativistic Lagrangian theories of MOND: the `Aquadratic-Lagrangian'
theory (AQUAL) and `Quasilinear MOND' (QUMOND). For AQUAL we consider only the
axisymmetric field configurations with the external field along the disk axis,
or a spherical galaxy with test-particle orbits inclined to the external field.
For the more manageable QUMOND we calculate also the three-dimensional field
configurations, with the external field inclined to the disk axis. We
investigate particularly to what degree an external field modifies the
quasi-flat part of rotation curves. While our QUMOND results agree well with
published numerical results in QUMOND, we find that AQUAL predicts weaker EFE
than published AQUAL results. However, AQUAL still predicts stronger EFE than
QUMOND, which demonstrates current theoretical uncertainties. We also
illustrate how the MOND prediction on the rising part of the rotation curve, in
the inner parts, depends largely on disk thickness but only weakly on a
plausible external field for a fixed galaxy model. Finally, we summarize our
results for the outer parts as an improved, approximate analytic expression.

Title:New Perspectives on the Exoplanet Radius Gap from a Mathematica Tool and Visualized Water Equation of State,"
Abstract:  Recent astronomical observations obtained with the Kepler and TESS missions
and their related ground-based follow-ups revealed an abundance of exoplanets
with a size intermediate between Earth and Neptune. A low occurrence rate of
planets has been identified at around twice the size of Earth, known as the
exoplanet radius gap or radius valley. We explore the geometry of this gap in
the mass-radius diagram, with the help of a Mathematica plotting tool developed
with the capability of manipulating exoplanet data in multidimensional
parameter space, and with the help of visualized water equations of state in
the temperature-density graph and the entropy-pressure graph. We show that the
radius valley can be explained by a compositional difference between smaller,
predominantly rocky planets and larger planets that exhibit greater
compositional diversity including cosmic ices (water, ammonia, methane) and
gaseous envelopes. In particular, among the larger planets, when viewed from
the perspective of planet equilibrium temperature, the hot ones are consistent
with ice-dominated composition without significant gaseous envelopes, while the
cold ones have more diverse compositions, including various amounts of gaseous
envelopes.

Title:On the parameter refinement of inflated exoplanets with large radius uncertainty based on TESS observations,"
Abstract:  We revisited ten known exoplanetary systems using publicly available data
provided by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The sample
presented in this work consists of short period transiting exoplanets, with
inflated radii and large reported uncertainty on their planetary radii. The
precise determination of these values is crucial in order to develop accurate
evolutionary models and understand the inflation mechanisms of these systems.
Aiming to evaluate the planetary radius measurement, we made use of the
planet-to-star radii ratio, a quantity that can be measured during a transit
event. We fit the obtained transit light curves of each target with a
detrending model and a transit model. Furthermore, we used emcee, which is
based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, to assess the best fit posterior
distributions of each system parameter of interest. We refined the planetary
radius of WASP-140 b by approximately 12%, and we derived a better precision on
its reported asymmetric radius uncertainty by approximately 86% and 67%. We
also refined the orbital parameters of WASP-120 b by 2$\sigma$. Moreover, using
the high-cadence TESS datasets, we were able to solve a discrepancy in the
literature, regarding the planetary radius of the exoplanet WASP-93 b. For all
the other exoplanets in our sample, even though there is a tentative trend that
planetary radii of (near-) grazing systems have been slightly overestimated in
the literature, the planetary radius estimation and the orbital parameters were
confirmed with independent observations from space, showing that TESS and
ground-based observations are overall in good agreement.

Title:A new photometric study of M14 (NGC 6402): An interpretation of the Horizontal Branch and beyond,"
Abstract:  We present a CCD $VI$ photometric study of the globular cluster M14.
Particular attention is given to the variable stars. This allowed new
classifications and cluster membership considerations. New variables are
reported; 3 RRc, 18 SR and 1 SX Phe. The Fourier decomposition of RR Lyrae
light curves lead to the mean cluster metallicity of [Fe/H]$_{\rm ZW}= -1.3 \pm
0.2$. Several independent methods yield a mean distance of $9.36 \pm 0.16$ kpc.
A Colour-Magnitude diagram outlined by the cluster members enabled a matching
with theoretical predictions of isochrones and zero-age horizontal branches,
whose fitting to the observations is in good agreement with the above distance
and metallicity. The Oosterhoff type of M14 is confirmed as Oo-int, and the
pulsating mode distribution of RR Lyrae stars on the HB shows that the bimodal
region of the instability strip is shared by RRab and RRc stars. By modelling
the mass loss at the RGB after the He flash events, we were able to represent
the blue tail of the HB, using a core mass of 0.48 $M_{\odot}$ and total masses
of 0.52-0.55 $M_{\odot}$. A progenitor star on the MS of 0.84 $M_{\odot}$
reaches the HB in about 12.5 Gyrs, consonant with previous age determinations
of the cluster. Type II Cepheids of M14 may be interpreted as products of
post-HB evolution, driven by the complex processes involving the burning of the
very thin low mass hydrogen and helium shells of these stars and their
minuscule envelopes. No evidences were found in favor of M14 being of
extragalactic origin.

Title:The effect of selection -- a tale of cluster mass measurement bias induced by correlation and projection,"
Abstract:  Cosmology analyses using galaxy clusters by the Dark Energy Survey have
recently uncovered an issue of previously unknown selection effect affecting
weak lensing mass estimates. In this letter, we use the Illustris-TNG
simulation to demonstrate that selecting on galaxy counts induces a selection
effect because of projection and correlation between different observables. We
compute the weak-lensing-like projected mass estimations of dark matter halos
and examine their projected subhalo counts. In the 2-D projected space, halos
that are measured as more massive than truth have higher subhalo counts. Thus,
projection along the line of sight creates cluster observables that are
correlated with cluster mass measurement deviations, which in turn creates a
mass measurement bias when the clusters are selected by this correlated
observable. We demonstrate that the bias is predicted in a forward model using
the observable-mass measurement correlation.

Title:Eclipse Mapping of EXO 0748-676: Evidence for a Massive Neutron Star,"
Abstract:  Determining the maximum possible neutron star (NS) mass places limits on the
equation of state (EoS) of ultra-dense matter. The mass of NSs in low mass
X-ray binaries can be determined from the binary mass function, providing
independent constraints are placed on both the binary inclination and mass
ratio. In eclipsing systems, they relate via the totality duration. EXO
0748-676 is an eclipsing NS low mass X-ray binary with a binary mass function
estimated using stellar emission lines from the irradiated face of the
companion. The NS mass is thus known as a function of mass ratio. Here we model
the X-ray eclipses in several energy bands, utilising archival XMM-Newton data.
We find a narrow region of absorbing material surrounding the companion star is
required to explain the energy-dependent eclipses. Therefore, we suggest the
companion may be experiencing ablation of its outer layers and that the system
could transition into a redback millisecond pulsar. Our fit returns a mass
ratio of $q=0.222^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ and an inclination $i = 76.5
\pm^{1.4}_{1.1}$. Combining these with the previously measured radial velocity
of $410 \pm 5$ km/s, derived from Doppler mapping analysis of H$_\alpha$
emission during quiescence, returns a NS mass of $\sim 2 M_\odot$ even if the
line originates as far from the NS as physically possible, favouring hard EoS.
The inferred mass increases for a more realistic emission point. However, a
$\sim 1.4 M_\odot$ canonical NS mass is possible when considering radial
velocity values derived from other emission lines observed both during outburst
and quiescence.

Title:Cosmology with one galaxy?,"
Abstract:  Galaxies can be characterized by many internal properties such as stellar
mass, gas metallicity, and star-formation rate. We quantify the amount of
cosmological and astrophysical information that the internal properties of
individual galaxies and their host dark matter halos contain. We train neural
networks using hundreds of thousands of galaxies from 2,000 state-of-the-art
hydrodynamic simulations with different cosmologies and astrophysical models of
the CAMELS project to perform likelihood-free inference on the value of the
cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We find that knowing the internal
properties of a single galaxy allow our models to infer the value of
$\Omega_{\rm m}$, at fixed $\Omega_{\rm b}$, with a $\sim10\%$ precision, while
no constraint can be placed on $\sigma_8$. Our results hold for any type of
galaxy, central or satellite, massive or dwarf, at all considered redshifts,
$z\leq3$, and they incorporate uncertainties in astrophysics as modeled in
CAMELS. However, our models are not robust to changes in subgrid physics due to
the large intrinsic differences the two considered models imprint on galaxy
properties. We find that the stellar mass, stellar metallicity, and maximum
circular velocity are among the most important galaxy properties to determine
the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We believe that our results can be explained
taking into account that changes in the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$, or
potentially $\Omega_{\rm b}/\Omega_{\rm m}$, affect the dark matter content of
galaxies. That effect leaves a distinct signature in galaxy properties to the
one induced by galactic processes. Our results suggest that the low-dimensional
manifold hosting galaxy properties provides a tight direct link between
cosmology and astrophysics.

Title:Finding Evidence for Inflation and the Origin of Galactic Magnetic Fields with CMB Surveys,"
Abstract:  The origin of the $\mu$G magnetic fields observed in galaxies is unknown. One
promising scenario is that magnetic fields generated during inflation, larger
than 0.1 nG on Mpc scales, were adiabatically compressed to $\mu$G strengths in
galaxies during structure formation. Thus, detecting a scale-invariant
primordial magnetic field (PMF) above 0.1 nG on Mpc scales just after
recombination would indicate an inflationary origin of galactic magnetic
fields. This would also provide compelling evidence that inflation occurred
since only an inflationary mechanism could generate such a strong,
scale-invariant magnetic field on Mpc scales. In contrast, constraining the
scale-invariant PMF strength to be below 0.1 nG would imply an inflationary
scenario is not the primary origin, since such weak PMFs cannot be amplified
enough via adiabatic compression to produce the strength of the galactic fields
we observe today. We find that measurements of anisotropic birefringence by
future CMB surveys will be able to improve the sensitivity to Mpc-scale
inflationary PMFs by an order of magnitude, and, in particular, that CMB-HD
would lower the upper bound to 0.072 nG at the 95% C.L., which is below the
critical 0.1 nG threshold for ruling out a purely inflationary origin. If
inflationary PMFs exist, we find that a CMB-HD survey would be able to detect
them with about $3\sigma$ significance or higher, providing evidence for
inflation itself.

"Title:Quasar Feedback Survey: Multi-phase outflows, turbulence and evidence for feedback caused by low power radio jets inclined into the galaxy disk","
Abstract:  We present a study of a luminous, z=0.15, type-2 quasar (log
[L([OIII])/(erg/s)]=42.8) from the Quasar Feedback Survey. It is classified as
'radio-quiet' (log [L(1.4 GHz)/(W/Hz)]=23.8); however, radio imaging reveals ~1
kpc low-power jets (log [Pjet/(erg/s)]=44) inclined into the plane of the
galaxy disk. We combine MUSE and ALMA observations to map stellar kinematics
and ionised and molecular gas properties. The jets are seen to drive
galaxy-wide bi-conical turbulent outflows, reaching W80 = 1000-1300 km/s, in
the ionised phase (traced via optical emission-lines), which also have
increased electron densities compared to the quiescent gas. The turbulent gas
is driven perpendicular to the jet axis and is escaping along the galaxy minor
axis, reaching 7.5 kpc on both sides. Traced via CO(3-2) emission, the
turbulent material in molecular gas phase is one-third as spatially extended
and has 3 times lower velocity-dispersion as compared to ionised gas. The jets
are seen to be strongly interacting with the interstellar medium (ISM) through
enhanced ionised emission and disturbed/depleted molecular gas at the jet
termini. We see further evidence for jet-induced feedback through significantly
higher stellar velocity-dispersion aligned, and co-spatial with, the jet axis
(<5 deg). We discuss possible negative and positive feedback scenarios arising
due to the interaction of the low-power jets with the ISM in the context of
recent jet-ISM interaction simulations, which qualitatively agree with our
observations. We discuss how jet-induced feedback could be an important
feedback mechanism even in bolometrically luminous 'radio-quiet' quasars.

Title:A 2-3 mm high-resolution molecular line survey towards the centre of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946,"
Abstract:  The complex physical, kinematic, and chemical properties of galaxy centres
make them interesting environments to examine with molecular line emission. We
present new $2-4$"" (${\sim}75{-}150$ pc at $7.7$ Mpc) observations at 2 and 3
mm covering the central $50$"" (${\sim}1.9$ kpc) of the nearby double-barred
spiral galaxy NGC 6946 obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer.
We detect spectral lines from ten molecules: CO, HCN, HCO$^+$, HNC, CS,
HC$_3$N, N$_2$H$^+$, C$_2$H, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO. We complemented these with
published 1mm CO observations and 33 GHz continuum observations to explore the
star formation rate surface density ${\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}}$ on 150 pc scales.
In this paper, we analyse regions associated with the inner bar of NGC 6946 $-$
the nuclear region (NUC), the northern (NBE), and southern inner bar end (SBE)
and we focus on short-spacing corrected bulk (CO) and dense gas tracers (HCN,
HCO$^+$, and HNC). We find that HCO$^+$ correlates best with
${\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}}$, but the dense gas fraction ($f_{\mathrm{dense}}$)
and star formation efficiency of the dense gas (${\mathrm{SFE_{dense}}}$) fits
show different behaviours than expected from large-scale disc observations.The
SBE has a higher ${\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}}$, $f_{\mathrm{dense}}$, and shocked
gas fraction than the NBE. We examine line ratio diagnostics and find a higher
CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio towards NBE than for the NUC. Moreover, comparison with
existing extragalactic datasets suggests that using the HCN/HNC ratio to probe
kinetic temperatures is not suitable on kiloparsec and sub-kiloparsec scales in
extragalactic regions. Lastly, our study shows that the HCO$^+$/HCN ratio might
not be a unique indicator to diagnose AGN activity in galaxies.

Title:Imprints of fermionic and bosonic mixed dark matter on the 21-cm signal at cosmic dawn,"
Abstract:  The 21-cm signal from the epoch of cosmic dawn prior to reionization consists
of a promising observable to gain new insights into the dark matter (DM)
sector. In this paper, we investigate its potential to constrain mixed (cold +
non-cold) dark matter scenarios that are characterised by the non-cold DM
fraction ($f_{\rm nCDM}$) and particle mass ($m_{\rm nCDM}$). As non-cold DM
species, we investigate both a fermionic (sterile neutrino) and a bosonic
(ultra-light axion) particle. We show how these scenarios affect the global
signal and the power spectrum using a halo-model implementation of the 21-cm
signal at cosmic dawn. Next to this study, we perform an inference-based
forecast study based on realistic mock power spectra from the Square Kilometre
Array (SKA) telescope. Assuming inefficient, yet non-zero star-formation in
minihaloes (i.e. haloes with mass below $10^8$ M$_{\odot}$), we obtain
stringent constraints on both $m_{\rm nCDM}$ and $f_{\rm nCDM}$ that go well
beyond current limits. Regarding the special case of $f_{\rm nCDM}\sim 1$, for
example, we find a constraint of $m_{\rm nCDM}>15$ keV (thermal mass) for
fermionic DM and $m_{\rm nCDM}>2\times10^{-20}$ eV for bosonic DM. For the
opposite case of dominating cold DM, we find that at most one percent of the
total DM abundance can be made of a hot fermionic or bosonic relic. All
constraints are provided at the 95 percent confidence level.

Title:LRG-BEASTS: sodium absorption and Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere of WASP-94A b using NTT/EFOSC2,"
Abstract:  We present an optical transmission spectrum for WASP-94A b, the first
atmospheric characterisation of this highly-inflated hot Jupiter. The planet
has a reported radius of $1.72^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ R$_{\textrm{Jup}}$, a mass of
only $0.456^{+0.032}_{-0.036}$ M$_{\textrm{Jup}}$, and an equilibrium
temperature of $1508 \pm 75$ K. We observed the planet transit
spectroscopically with the EFOSC2 instrument on the ESO New Technology
Telescope (NTT) at La Silla, Chile: the first use of NTT/EFOSC2 for
transmission spectroscopy. We achieved an average transit-depth precision of
$128$ ppm for bin widths of $\sim200$ Angstrom. This high precision was
achieved in part by linking Gaussian Process hyperparameters across all
wavelength bins. The resulting transmission spectrum, spanning a wavelength
range of $3800 - 7140$ Angstrom, exhibits a sodium absorption with a
significance of $4.9\sigma$, suggesting a relatively cloud-free atmosphere. The
sodium signal may be broadened, with a best fitting width of $78_{-32}^{+67}$
Angstrom in contrast to the instrumental resolution of $27.2 \pm 0.2$ Angstrom.
We also detect a steep slope in the blue end of the transmission spectrum,
indicating the presence of Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere of WASP-94A b.
Retrieval models show evidence for the observed slope to be super-Rayleigh and
potential causes are discussed. Finally, we find narrow absorption cores in the
CaII H&K lines of WASP-94A, suggesting the star is enshrouded in gas escaping
the hot Jupiter.

Title:Magnetic fields in the formation of the first stars.--II Results,"
Abstract:  Beginning with cosmological initial conditions at z=100, we simulate the
effects of magnetic fields on the formation of Population III stars and compare
our results with the predictions of Paper I. We use Gadget-2 to follow the
evolution of the system while the field is weak. We introduce a new method for
treating kinematic fields by tracking the evolution of the deformation tensor.
The growth rate in this stage of the simulation is lower than expected for
diffuse astrophysical plasmas, which have a very low resistivity (high magnetic
Prandtl number); we attribute this to the large numerical resistivity in
simulations, corresponding to a magnetic Prandtl number of order unity. When
the magnetic field begins to be dynamically significant in the core of the
minihalo at z=27, we map it onto a uniform grid and follow the evolution in an
adaptive mesh refinement, MHD simulation in Orion2. The nonlinear evolution of
the field in the Orion2 simulation violates flux-freezing and is consistent
with the theory proposed by Xu & Lazarian. The fields approach equipartition
with kinetic energy at densities ~ 10^10 - 10^12 cm^-3. When the same
calculation is carried out in Orion2 with no magnetic fields, several
protostars form, ranging in mass from ~ 1 to 30 M_sol with magnetic fields,
only a single ~ 30 M_sol protostar forms by the end of the simulation. Magnetic
fields thus suppress the formation of low-mass Pop III stars, yielding a
top-heavy Pop III IMF and contributing to the absence of observed Pop III
stars.

Title:New binary black hole mergers in the LIGO--Virgo O3a data,"
Abstract:  We report the detection of ten new binary black hole (BBH) merger signals in
the publicly released data from the the first half of the third observing run
(O3a) of advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo. Candidates are identified using an
updated version of the IAS pipeline (Venumadhav et al.), and events are
declared according to criteria similar to those in the GWTC-2.1 catalog (Abbott
et al.). The updated search is sensitive to a larger region of parameter space,
applies a template prior that accounts for different search volume as a
function of intrinsic parameters, and uses an improved coherent detection
statistic that optimally combines data from the Hanford and Livingston
detectors. Among the ten new events, we find interesting astrophysical
scenarios including sources with confidently large effective spin in both the
positive and negative directions, high-mass black holes that are difficult to
form in stellar collapse models due to (pulsational) pair instability, and
low-mass mergers bridging the gap between neutron stars and the lightest
observed black holes. We detect events populating the upper and lower black
hole mass gaps with both extreme and near-unity mass ratios, and one of the
possible neutron star--black hole mergers is well localized for electromagnetic
counterpart searches. We see a substantial increase in significance for many of
the events previously reported by other pipelines, and we detect all of the
GWTC-2.1 BBH mergers with coincident data in Hanford and Livingston except for
three loud events that get vetoed (compatible with the false-positive rate of
our veto procedure) and three that fall below the detection threshold. We also
return to significance the event GW190909_114149, which was reduced to a
sub-threshold trigger in GWTC-2.1. This makes a total of 42 BBH mergers
detected by our pipeline's Hanford--Livingston coincident search of the O3a

Title:Strong H$_2$O and CO emission features in the spectrum of KELT-20b driven by stellar UV irradiation,"
Abstract:  Know thy star, know thy planetary atmosphere. Every exoplanet with
atmospheric measurements orbits around a star, and the stellar environment
directly affects the planetary atmosphere. Here we present the emission
spectrum of ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-20b which provides an observational link
between host star properties and planet atmospheric thermal structure. It is
currently the only planet with thermal emission measurements in the
$T_{eq}\sim$2200K range that orbits around an early A-type star. By comparing
it with other similar ultra-hot Jupiters around FGK stars, we can better
understand how different host star types influence planetary atmospheres. The
emission spectrum covers 0.6 to 4.5 $\mu m$ with data from TESS, HST WFC3/G141,
and Spitzer 4.5 $\mu m$ channel. KELT-20b has a 1.4 $\mu m$ water feature
strength metric of S$_{H_2O}$ = -0.097$\pm$0.02 and a blackbody brightness
temperature difference of 528K between WFC3/G141 (T$_b$=2402$\pm$14K) and
Spitzer 4.5 $\mu m$ channel (T$_b$=2930$\pm59$K). These very large H$_2$O and
CO emission features combined with the A-type host star make KELT-20b a unique
planet among other similar hot Jupiters. The abundant FUV, NUV, and optical
radiation from its host star (T$_{eff}=8720\pm250$K) is expected to be the key
that drives its strong thermal inversion and prominent emission features based
on previous PHOENIX models calculations.

Title:Properties of Molecular Gas in Galaxies in Early and Mid Stages of Interaction. III. Resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt Law,"
Abstract:  We study properties of the interstellar medium, an ingredient of stars, and
star formation activity, in four nearby galaxy pairs in the early and mid
stages of interaction for both a galaxy scale and a kpc scale. The galaxy-scale
Kennicutt-Schmidt law shows that seven of eight interacting galaxies have a
star formation rate within a factor of three compared with the best-fit of the
isolated galaxies, although we have shown that molecular hydrogen gas is
efficiently produced from atomic hydrogen during the interaction in the
previous paper. The galaxy-scale specific star formation rate (sSFR) and star
formation efficiency (SFE) in interacting galaxies are comparable to those in
isolated galaxies. We also investigate SFE and the Kennicutt-Schmidt law on a
kpc scale. The spatial distributions of SFE reveal that SFE is locally
enhanced, and the enhanced regions take place asymmetrically or at off-centre
regions. The local enhancement of SFE could be induced by shock. We find that
the index of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law for the interacting galaxies in the
early stage is 1.30$\pm$0.04, which is consistent with that of the isolated
galaxies. Since CO emission, which is used in the Kennicutt-Schmidt law, is a
tracer of the amount of molecular gas, this fact suggests that dense gas, which
is more directly connected to star formation, is not changed at the early stage
of interaction.

Title:A model of double coronal hard X-ray sources in solar flares,"
Abstract:  A number of double coronal X-ray sources have been observed during solar
flares by RHESSI, where the two sources reside at different sides of the
inferred reconnection site. However, where and how are these X-ray-emitting
electrons accelerated remains unclear. Here we present the first model of the
double coronal hard X-ray (HXR) sources, where electrons are accelerated by a
pair of termination shocks driven by bi-directional fast reconnection outflows.
We model the acceleration and transport of electrons in the flare region by
numerically solving the Parker transport equation using velocity and magnetic
fields from the macroscopic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a flux rope
eruption. We show that electrons can be efficiently accelerated by the
termination shocks and high-energy electrons mainly concentrate around the two
shocks. The synthetic HXR emission images display two distinct sources
extending to $>$100 keV below and above the reconnection region, with the upper
source much fainter than the lower one. The HXR energy spectra of the two
coronal sources show similar spectral slopes, consistent with the observations.
Our simulation results suggest that the flare termination shock can be a
promising particle acceleration mechanism in explaining the double-source
nonthermal emissions in solar flares.

"Title:Energy transfer, discontinuities and heating in the inner solar wind measured with a weak and local formulation of the Politano-Pouquet law","
Abstract:  The solar wind is a highly turbulent plasma for which the mean rate of energy
transfer $\varepsilon$ has been measured for a long time using the
Politano-Pouquet (PP98) exact law. However, this law assumes statistical
homogeneity that can be violated by the presence of discontinuities. Here, we
introduce a new method based on the inertial dissipation $\Dis$ whose
analytical form is derived from incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); it
can be considered as a weak and {\it local} (in space) formulation of the PP98
law whose expression is recovered after integration is space. We used $\Dis$ to
estimate the local energy transfer rate from the \textit{THEMIS-B} and
\textit{Parker Solar Probe} (PSP) data taken in the solar wind at different
heliospheric distances. Our study reveals that discontinuities near the Sun
lead to a strong energy transfer that affects a wide range of scales $\sigma$.
We also observe that switchbacks seem to be characterized by a singular
behavior with an energy transfer varying as $\sigma^{-3/4}$, which slightly
differs from classical discontinuities characterized by a $\sigma^{-1}$
scaling. A comparison between the measurements of $\varepsilon$ and $\Dis$
shows that in general the latter is significantly larger than the former.

Title:The prototype X-ray binary GX 339-4: using TeV gamma-rays to assess LMXBs as Galactic cosmic ray accelerators,"
Abstract:  Since the discovery of cosmic rays (CRs) over a century ago, their origin
remains an open question. Galactic CRs with energy up to the knee ($10^{15}$
eV) are considered to originate from supernova remnants, but this scenario has
recently been questioned due to lack of TeV $\gamma$-ray counterparts in many
cases. Extragalactic CRs on the other hand, are thought to be associated with
accelerated particles in the relativistic jets launched by supermassive
accreting black holes at the center of galaxies. Scaled down versions of such
jets have been detected in X-ray binaries hosting a stellar black hole (BHXBs).
In this work, we investigate the possibility that the smaller-scale jets in
transient outbursts of low-mass BHXBs could be sources of Galactic CRs. To
better test this scenario, we model the entire electromagnetic spectrum of such
sources focusing on the potential TeV regime, using the `canonical' low-mass
BHXB GX 339-4 as a benchmark. Taking into account both the leptonic radiative
processes and the $\gamma$-rays produced via neutral pion decay from inelastic
hadronic interactions, we predict the GeV and TeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum of GX
339-4 using lower-frequency emission as constraints. Based on this test-case of
GX 339-4 we investigate whether other, nearby low-mass BHXBs could be detected
by the next-generation very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray facility the Cherenkov
Telescope Array, which would establish them as additional and numerous
potential sources of CRs in the Galaxy.

Title:The Dynamic Coupling of Streamers and Pseudostreamers to the Heliosphere,"
Abstract:  The slow solar wind is generally believed to result from the interaction of
open and closed coronal magnetic flux at streamers and pseudostreamers. We use
3-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to determine the detailed
structure and dynamics of open-closed interactions that are driven by
photospheric convective flows. The photospheric magnetic field model includes a
global dipole giving rise to a streamer together with a large parasitic
polarity region giving rise to a pseudostreamer that separates a satellite
coronal hole from the main polar hole. Our numerical domain extends out to 30
solar radii and includes an isothermal solar wind, so that the coupling between
the corona and heliosphere can be calculated rigorously. This system is driven
by imposing a large set of quasi-random surface flows that capture the driving
of coronal flux in the vicinity of streamer and pseudostreamer boundaries by
the supergranular motions. We describe the resulting structures and dynamics.
Interchange reconnection dominates the evolution at both streamer and
pseudostreamer boundaries, but the details of the resulting structures are
clearly different from one another. Additionally, we calculate in situ
signatures of the reconnection and determine the dynamic mapping from the inner
heliosphere back to the Sun for a test spacecraft orbit. We discuss the
implications of our results for interpreting observations from inner
heliospheric missions, such as Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, and for
space weather modeling of the slow solar wind.

Abstract:  Aims: Develop a data-driven and statistically based method for finding such

significance robustly. Methods: We use data from Gaia EDR3 extended with radial
velocities from ground-based spectroscopic surveys to construct a sample of
halo stars within 2.5 kpc from the Sun. We apply a hierarchical clustering
method that uses the single linkage algorithm in a 3D space defined by the
commonly used integrals of motion energy $E$, together with two components of
the angular momentum, $L_z$ and $L_\perp$. To evaluate the statistical
significance of the clusters found, we compare the density within an
ellipsoidal region centered on the cluster to that of random sets with similar
global dynamical properties. We pick out the signal at the location of their
maximum statistical significance in the hierarchical tree. We estimate the
proximity of a star to the cluster center using the Mahalanobis distance. We
also apply the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm in velocity space. Results: Our
procedure identifies 67 highly significant clusters ($ > 3\sigma$), containing
12\% of the sources in our halo set, and in total 232 subgroups or individual
streams in velocity space. In total, 13.8\% of the stars in our data set can be
confidently associated to a significant cluster based on their Mahalanobis
distance. Inspection of our data set reveals a complex web of relationships
between the significant clusters, suggesting that they can be tentatively
grouped into at least 6 main structures, many of which can be associated to
previously identified halo substructures, and a number of independent
substructures. This preliminary conclusion is further explored in an

discarding potential candidates, C5H- among them, we conclude that the carrier
is C5H+, for which accurate ab initio calculations provide B=2410.3 MHz. We
also report for the first time in a cold starless core the detection of the
C3H+ cation. The column densities we derive for C5H+ and C3H+ are
(8.8+/-0.5)e10 cm-2 and (2.4+/-0.2)e10 cm-2, respectively. Hence, the C5H+/C3H+
abundance ratio is 3.7+/-0.5. The fact that C5H+ is more abundant than C3H+ is
well explained by dedicated chemical models and is due to the slow reactivity
of C5H+ with H2, while C3H+ reacts with H2.

Title:Efficient modeling of correlated noise. III. Scalable methods for jointly modeling several observables' time series with Gaussian processes,"
Abstract:  The radial velocity method is a very productive technique used to detect and
confirm extrasolar planets. The most recent spectrographs, such as ESPRESSO or
EXPRES, have the potential to detect Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars.
However, stellar activity can induce radial velocity variations that dilute or
even mimic the signature of a planet. A widely recognized method for
disentangling these signals is to model the radial velocity time series,
jointly with stellar activity indicators, using Gaussian processes and their
derivatives. However, such modeling is prohibitive in terms of computational
resources for large data sets, as the cost typically scales as the total number
of measurements cubed.
Here, we present S+LEAF 2, a Gaussian process framework that can be used to
jointly model several time series, with a computational cost that scales
linearly with the data set size. This framework thus provides a
state-of-the-art Gaussian process model, with tractable computations even for
large data sets.
We illustrate the power of this framework by reanalyzing the 246 HARPS radial
velocity measurements of the nearby K2 dwarf HD 138038, together with two
activity indicators. We reproduce the results of a previous analysis of these
data, but with a strongly decreased computational cost (more than two order of
magnitude). The gain would be even greater for larger data sets.

Title:Absorption features in sub-TeV gamma-ray spectra of BL Lac objects,"
Abstract:  The production site of gamma rays in blazars is closely related to their
interaction with the photon fields surrounding the active galactic nucleus. In
this paper, we discuss an indirect method that may help to unveil the presence
of ambient structures in BL Lac objects through the analysis of their gamma-ray
spectrum. Gamma rays, passing through structures at different distances from
the black hole, interact via $\gamma\gamma$ pair production with the
corresponding photon fields and produce absorption features in their spectral
energy distribution. An interaction with a putative broad-line region may
reduce the gamma-ray flux only if its production site were very close to the
central engine. However, if jet photons interact with a bath of optical-UV seed
photons produced by a narrow-line region extended over the parsec scale, the
consequent $\gamma\gamma$ process may cause absorption features detectable at a
few hundreds GeV. The detection of such absorption features is facilitated in
sources with spectra reaching TeV energies, and specifically HBLs and EHBLs
(extreme blazars) may represent exceptional probes to investigate this topic.
We discuss recent observations of an extreme blazar named 2WHSP
J073326.7+515354 (or PGC 2402248), which shows evidence of such an absorption
feature in its gamma-ray spectrum and narrow emission lines in the optical
spectrum, suggesting the presence of narrow-line regions in its large-scale
environment. Finally, we discuss how sub-TeV absorption features in the spectra
of BL Lac objects may affect their broadband modeling, and eventually represent
a powerful diagnostic tool to constrain the gamma-ray production site and the
jet environment.

Title:Stellar rotation rates in Kepler eccentric (heartbeat) binaries obtained from r-mode signatures,"
Abstract:  R-mode oscillations in a rotating star produce characteristic signatures in a
Fourier amplitude spectrum at frequencies related with the rotation frequency,
which can be, in turn, used to obtain the surface rotation rate of the star.
Some binary stars observed by Kepler indicate the presence of r~modes that are
probably excited by the tidal effect. In this paper, we have obtained stellar
rotation periods in 20 eccentric (heartbeat) binaries with r-mode signatures.
The majority of the rotation periods are found to be comparable to
pseudo-synchronous periods, in which the angular velocity of rotation is
similar to the angular orbital motion of the companion at periastron. In
particular, for the heartbeat stars with orbital periods longer than about
8\,d, all but one agree with pseudo-synchronous rotation. In contrast to a
previous investigation by Zimmerman et al., our result supports the
pseudo-synchronisation theory developed by Hut.

Title:A Possible Explanation for the Blue Spectral Slope Observed on B-type Asteroids,"
Abstract:  In an effort to better understand the role dark material plays in the
reflectance spectrum of carbonaceous asteroids, we performed laboratory studies
focusing on quantifying how the addition of relevant dark material (graphite,
magnetite and troilite) can alter the ultraviolet-visible and near-infrared
spectrum of a neutral silicate mineral. We find that addition of graphite,
magnetite and troilite all darken the reflectance spectrum of our forsterite
samples and cause the spectral slope to decrease (become blue). These spectral
changes can be caused by both nm- and micron-sized grains. In the
ultraviolet-visible region, we find that graphite is most efficient at altering
the spectral slope, while in the near-infrared, magnetite is the most
efficient. At all wavelengths studied, graphite is the most efficient at
darkening our sample spectrum. However, the observation that troilite also
alters the slope and albedo of our samples suggests that the spectral changes
caused by magnetite and graphite may not be unique. In addition, we find that
the spectral slopes in our mixtures compare generally well to what has been
observed on Bennu suggesting that a significant portion of fine-grained dark
material, including sulfides, present in the regolith can cause the observed
negative (blue) slope found on B-type asteroids.

Title:What drives galaxy quenching? A deep connection between galaxy kinematics and quenching in the local Universe,"
Abstract:  We develop a 2D inclined rotating disc model, which we apply to the stellar
velocity maps of 1862 galaxies taken from the MaNGA survey (SDSS public Data
Release 15). We use a random forest classifier to identify the kinematic
parameters that are most connected to galaxy quenching. We find that kinematic
parameters that relate predominantly to the disc (such as the mean rotational
velocity) and parameters that characterise whether a galaxy is rotation- or
dispersion-dominated (such as the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity
dispersion) are not fundamentally linked to the quenching of star formation.
Instead, we find overwhelmingly that it is the absolute level of velocity
dispersion (a property that relates primarily to a galaxy's bulge/spheroidal
component) that is most important for separating star forming and quenched
galaxies. Furthermore, a partial correlation analysis shows that many commonly
discussed correlations between galaxy properties and quenching are spurious,
and that the fundamental correlation is between quenching and velocity
dispersion. In particular, we find that at fixed velocity dispersion, there is
only a very weak dependence of quenching on the disc properties, whereby more
discy galaxies are slightly more likely to be forming stars. By invoking the
tight relationship between black hole mass and velocity dispersion, and noting
that black hole mass traces the total energy released by AGN, we argue that
these data support a scenario in which quenching occurs by preventive feedback
from AGN. The kinematic measurements from this work are publicly available.

Title:ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): A Hot Corino Survey toward Protostellar Cores in the Orion Cloud,"
Abstract:  The presence of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium
(ISM) is of great interest since it may link to the origin and prevalence of
life in the universe. Aiming to investigate the occurrence of COMs and their
possible origins, we conducted a chemical census toward a sample of
protostellar cores as part of the ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold
Clumps (ALMASOP) project. We report the detection of 11 hot corino sources,
which exhibit compact emissions from warm and abundant COMs, among 56 Class 0/I
protostellar cores. All the hot corino sources discovered are likely Class 0
and their sizes of the warm region ($>$ 100 K) are comparable to 100 au. The
luminosity of the hot corino sources exhibits positive correlations with the
total number of methanol and the extent of its emissions. Such correlations are
consistent with the thermal desorption picture for the presence of hot corino
and suggest that the lower luminosity (Class 0) sources likely have a smaller
region with COMs emissions. With the same sample selection method and detection
criteria being applied, the detection rates of the warm methanol in the Orion
cloud (15/37) and the Perseus cloud (28/50) are statistically similar when the
cloud distances and the limited sample size are considered. Observing the same
set of COM transitions will bring a more informative comparison between the
cloud properties.

Title:A spectral hardening in the Fermi-LAT Data of 1ES 0502+675,"
Abstract:  The $\gamma$-ray spectral feature of the blazar 1ES 0502+675 is investigated
by using Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) Pass 8 data (between 100 MeV
and 300 GeV) covering from 2008 August to 2021 April. A significant
($\sim4\sigma$) hardening at $\sim$ 1 GeV is found in the $\gamma$-ray spectrum
during a moderately flaring state (MJD 55050-55350). The photon index below and
above the break energy is $\Gamma_1=2.36\pm0.31$ and $\Gamma_2=1.33\pm0.11$,
respectively. In the rest of the observations, the $\gamma$-ray spectrum can be
described by a power-law form with the photon index of $\approx1.6$. In the
frame of a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, the spectral
hardening is interpreted as the transition between the synchrotron component
and the SSC component. This could be the result of a slight increase of the
break/maximum Lorentz factor of the electrons.

Title:The transiting planetary system WASP-86/KELT-12: TESS provides the casting vote,"
Abstract:  A transiting planetary system was discovered independently by two groups,
under the names WASP-86 (Faedi et al. 2016) and KELT-12 (Stevens et al. 2017).
The properties of the system determined in these works were very different,
most tellingly a variation of a factor of three in the measured radius of the
planet. We suggest that the system be named WASP-86/KELT-12 to better apportion
the credit for discovery between the two groups. We analyse the light curve of
this system from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which observed it
in two sectors, following the Homogeneous Studies approach. We find properties
intermediate between the two previous studies: the star has a mass of 1.278 +/-
0.039 Msun and a radius of 2.02 +/- 0.12 Rsun, and the planet has a mass of
0.833 +/- 0.049 Mjup and a radius of 1.382 +/- 0.089 Rjup. The discrepancy in
the two previous sets of measured properties of the system arises from a
disagreement over the transit depth and duration, caused by the transit being
long and shallow so not well suited to follow-up photometry from ground-based
telescopes. We also update the orbital ephemeris to aid future work on this
system, which is a good candidate for characterising the atmosphere of a planet
through transmission spectroscopy.

Title:Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper VIII. The doubly-eclipsing quadruple star system V498 Cygni,"
Abstract:  V498 Cyg is an early-B-type binary known to show eclipses on a period of 3.48
d, and two sets of spectral lines. We present the discovery of a second set of
eclipses, on a 1.44-d period, in the light curve of this object from the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We develop a model of the light
curve to simultaneously fit the properties of both eclipsing binaries and apply
this to the TESS observations. We are able to fit the light curve of the
fainter system well, but the light curve fit for the brighter system is unable
to reproduce either its asymmetric primary eclipse or its changing light curve
shape. The available eclipse timing measurements are extremely scattered so we
determine orbital ephemerides based only on the TESS data. We infer the
physical properties of all four stars, estimating the masses of the components
of the brighter binary to be 10 Msun and 11 Msun, and of the fainter binary to
be 6.5 Msun and 3.5 Msun. The properties of the system may be reliably
determined in future by obtaining radial velocity measurements of the component
stars.

Title:Microlensing constraints on clustered primordial black holes,"
Abstract:  The discovery of black-hole-binary mergers through their gravitational wave
(GW) emission has reopened the exciting possibility that dark matter is made,
at least partly, of primordial black holes (PBHs). However, this scenario is
challenged by many observational probes that set bounds on the relative PBH
abundance across a broad range of viable PBH masses. Among these bounds, the
ones coming from microlensing surveys lead to the strongest constraints in the
mass range from $\sim 10^{-10}$ to a few M$_{\odot}$. The upper part of this
range precisely corresponds to the mass window inside which the formation of
PBHs should be boosted due to the QCD phase transition in the early Universe,
which makes the microlensing probes particularly important. However, it has
been argued that taking into account the inevitable clustering of PBH on small
scales can significantly relax or entirely remove these bounds. While the
impact of PBH clustering on the GW event rate has been studied in detail, its
impact on the microlensing event rate has not yet been fully assessed. In this
Letter, we address this issue, and show that clusters arising from isocurvature
perturbations, that originating from PBHs formed from Gaussian initial
curvature perturbations, do not alter the current microlensing constraints, as
they are not sufficiently compact.

Title:HST observations of the globular cluster NGC 6402 (M14) and its peculiar multiple populations,"
Abstract:  We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometric results for NGC 6402, a
highly reddened very luminous Galactic globular cluster (GC). Recent
spectroscopic observations of its red giant stars have shown a quite peculiar
behavior in the chemistry of its multiple populations. These results have
prompted UV and optical HST observations aimed at obtaining the cluster's
""Chromosome map"" (ChM), an efficient tool to classify GCs and characterize
their multiple populations. We find that the discontinuity in the abundance
distributions of O, Mg, Al and Na inferred from spectroscopy is more nuanced in
the ChM, which is mostly sensitive to nitrogen. Nevertheless, photometry in
optical bands reveals a double main sequence, indicating a discontinuity in the
helium content of the populations. The population with the largest chemical
anomalies (extreme) peaks at a helium mass fraction Y~0.31. This helium content
is consistent with results from the analysis of the distribution of
horizontal-branch stars and the spectrophotometry of the red giants. The ChM
and the color magnitude diagrams are compared with those in NGC 2808, a
prototype GC with helium abundances up to Y > 0.35, and both confirm that NGC
6402 does not host stellar populations with such extreme helium content.
Further, the ChM reveals the presence of a group of stars with larger
metallicity, thus indicating that NGC 6402 is a Type II cluster. The modalities
of formation of the multiple populations in NGC 6402 are briefly surveyed, with
main attention on the Asymptotic Giant Branch and Supermassive star models, and
on possible clusters' merging.

"Title:Magnetic field topology, chemical spot distributions and photometric variability of the Ap star phi Draconis","
Abstract:  The primary component of the multiple star phi Dra is one of the brightest
magnetic chemically peculiar stars in the northern sky. Here we report results
of a comprehensive study of the rotational photometric variability, binarity,
magnetic field geometry, and surface chemical spot structure for this star. We
derived a precise photometric rotational period of 1.71650213(21) d based on
one year of TESS nearly continuous space observations and discovered modulation
of the stellar light curve with the phase of the 127.9-d binary orbit due to
the light time travel effect. We revised parameters of the binary orbit and
detected spectroscopic contribution of the secondary. A tomographic mapping
technique was applied to the average intensity and circular polarisation
profiles derived from Narval high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations.
This analysis yielded a detailed map of the global magnetic field topology
together with the surface distributions of Si, Cr, and Fe abundances. Magnetic
mapping demonstrates that the surface field structure of phi Dra is dominated
by a distorted dipolar component with a peak field strength of 1.4 kG and a
large asymmetry between the poles. Chemical maps show an enhancement of Cr, Fe
and, to a lesser extent, Si in a series of spots encircling intersections of
the magnetic and rotational equators. These chemical spot geometries do not
directly correlate with either the local field strength or the field
inclination.

"Title:Sub-surface granular dynamics in the context of oblique, low-velocity impacts into angular granular media","
Abstract:  Oblique, low-velocity impacts onto extraterrestrial terrain are an inevitable
occurrence during space exploration. We conduct two-dimensional discrete
simulations to model such impacts into a bed of triangular grains. Finite
element method provides the basis for simulation, enabling the angular grain
geometry. Our findings re-create the three classes of impact behavior
previously noted from experiments: full-stop, rollout, and ricochet
\citep*{Wright2020}. An application of Set Voronoi tessellation assesses
packing fraction at a high resolution, revealing how grains shift relative to
each other during an impact event. Calculation of Von Mises strain
distributions then reveal how grains shift relative to the overall system,
leading to the notion of the 'skin zone'. Intuition would suggest that the
region of perturbed grains would grow deeper with higher velocity impacts,
results instead show that increasing velocity may actually evoke a change in
the grains' dissipative response that boosts lateral perturbation. Finally, we
consider as a whole how sub-surface response could link with impactor dynamics
to deepen our understanding of oblique, low-velocity impact events and help to
improve mission outcomes.

Title:The low-end of the black hole mass function at cosmic dawn,"
Abstract:  Understanding the formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at
high redshift represents a major challenge for theoretical models. In this work
we investigate the early evolution of the first SMBHs by constraining their
distribution in mass and luminosity at $z > 4$. In particular, we focus on the
poorly explored low-mass end of the nuclear black hole (BH) distribution down
to $z \simeq 4$, and explore its connection with the nature of the first BH
seeds and the processes governing their mass growth. To this aim, we have
developed CAT (Cosmic Archaeology Tool), a new semi-analytic model that
describes the formation of the first stars and black holes in a self-consistent
way and follows the co-evolution of nuclear BHs and their host galaxies for a
representative population at $z > 4$. We find that current observational
constraints favour models where the growth of BH seeds is Eddington limited and
occurs at the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton rate or where super-Eddington accretion
occurs via a slim disk during gas rich galaxy mergers. The main difference
between these two model variants lies at the low-end of the predicted mass and
luminosity functions at $4 \le z \le 6$, where a clear gap appears in the first
model, reflecting the stunted growth of light BH seeds formed as remnants of
the first stars. Detecting this signature will be extremely challenging even
for the future generation of space observatories, such as JWST, Athena and
Lynx.

Title:Probing the physicochemical properties of the Leo Ring and the Leo I group,"
Abstract:  We present an absorption line study of the physical and chemical properties
of the Leo HI Ring and the Leo I Group as traced by 11 quasar sightlines spread
over a 600 kpc X 800 kpc region. Using HST/COS G130/G160 archival observations
as constraints, we couple cloud-by-cloud, multiphase, Bayesian ionization
modeling with galaxy property information to determine the plausible origin of
the absorbing gas along these sightlines. We search for absorption in the range
600 km/s - 1400 km/s consistent with the kinematics of the Leo Ring/Group. We
find absorption plausibly associated with the Leo Ring towards five sightlines.
Along three other sightlines, we find absorption likely to be associated with
individual galaxies, intragroup gas, and/or large-scale filamentary structure.
The absorption along these five sightlines is stronger in metal lines than
expected from individual galaxies, indicative of multiple contributions, and of
the complex kinematics of the region. We also identify three sightlines within
a 7-degree X 6-degree field around the Leo Ring, along which we do not find any
absorption. We find that the metallicities associated with the Leo Ring are
generally high, with values between solar and several times solar. The inferred
high metallicities are consistent with the origin of the ring as tidal debris
from a major galaxy merger.

Title:Baryon Pasting Algorithm: Halo-based and Particle-based Pasting Methods,"
Abstract:  We present a fast methodology to produce mock observations of the thermal and
kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects based on dark matter only $N$-body
simulations coupled with the analytic intra-cluster medium model. The methods
employ two different approaches: halo-based pasting (HP) and particle-based
pasting (PP). The former pastes gas density and pressure onto halos and
requires only halo catalogue, and the latter also considers contribution from
field particles as well, i.e., particles which do not belong to any halos, and
thus utilises the full particle information. Therefore, the PP algorithm
incorporates secondary effects beyond the HP algorithm: asphericity of halos
and contribution from diffuse gas. In particular, such diffuse component is the
dominant source of the kinetic SZ effect. As validation of our methods, we have
produced 108 all-sky maps with HP and 108 flat-sky maps which cover $5 \times 5
\, \mathrm{deg}^2$ with both of HP and PP. Our method can produce a mock map
within a few hours even for all-sky coverage with parallel computational
environment. The resultant power spectra of these maps are consistent with
theoretical predictions. We discuss the utility of baryon pasted mock SZ maps
for estimating the covariance matrix of cross-correlation between SZ effects
and other large-scale structure probes as well as modelling the selection and
projection effects for cluster cosmology.

Title:GOODS-ALMA 2.0: Starbursts in the main sequence reveal compact star formation regulating galaxy evolution prequenching,"
Abstract:  Compact star formation appears to be generally common in dusty star-forming
galaxies (SFGs). However, its role in the framework set by the scaling
relations in galaxy evolution remains to be understood. In this work we follow
up on the galaxy sample from the GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, an ALMA blind survey at
1.1mm covering a continuous area of 72.42arcmin$^2$ using two array
configurations. We derived physical properties, such as star formation rates,
gas fractions, depletion timescales, and dust temperatures for the galaxy
sample built from the survey. There exists a subset of galaxies that exhibit
starburst-like short depletion timescales, but they are located within the
scatter of the so-called main sequence of SFGs. These are dubbed starbursts in
the main sequence and display the most compact star formation and they are
characterized by the shortest depletion timescales, lowest gas fractions, and
highest dust temperatures of the galaxy sample, compared to typical SFGs at the
same stellar mass and redshift. They are also very massive, accounting for
$\sim 60\%$ of the most massive galaxies in the sample ($\log
(M_{\rm{*}}/M_{\odot}) > 11.0$). We find trends between the areas of the
ongoing star formation regions and the derived physical properties for the
sample, unveiling the role of compact star formation as a physical driver of
these properties. Starbursts in the main sequence appear to be the extreme
cases of these trends. We discuss possible scenarios of galaxy evolution to
explain the results drawn from our galaxy sample. Our findings suggest that the
star formation rate is sustained in SFGs by gas and star formation compression,
keeping them within the main sequence even when their gas fractions are low and
they are presumably on the way to quiescence.

Abstract:  We analyze the angular power spectrum (APS) of the unresolved gamma-ray
background (UGRB) emission and combine it with the measured properties of the
resolved gamma-ray sources of the Fermi-LAT 4FGL catalog. Our goals are to
dissect the composition of the gamma-ray sky and to establish the relevance of
different classes of source populations of active galactic nuclei in
determining the observed size of the UGRB anisotropy, especially at low
energies. We find that, under physical assumptions for the spectral energy
dispersion, i.e. by using the 4FGL catalog data as a prior, two populations are
required to fit APS data, namely flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) at low
energies and BL Lacs (BLLs) at higher energies. The inferred luminosity
functions agree well with the extrapolation of the FSRQ and BLL ones obtained
from the 4FLG catalog. We use these luminosity functions to calculate the UGRB
intensity from blazars, finding a contribution of 20% at 1GeV and 30% above 10
GeV. Finally, bounds on an additional gamma-ray emission due to annihilating
dark matter are derived.

Abstract:  We introduce SERRA, a suite of zoom-in high-resolution ($\sim 10\,\rm pc$)
cosmological simulations including non-equilibrium chemistry and on-the-fly
radiative transfer. The outputs are post-processed to derive galaxy UV+FIR
continuum and emission line properties. Results are compared with available
multi-wavelength data to constrain the physical properties (e.g., star
formation rates, stellar/gas/dust mass, metallicity) of high-redshift $6
\lesssim z \lesssim 15$ galaxies. This flagship paper focuses on the $z=7.7$
sub-sample, including 202 galaxies with stellar mass $10^7 M_\odot \lesssim
M_\star \lesssim 5\times 10^{10}M_\odot$, and specific star formation ranging
from ${\rm sSFR} \sim 100\,{\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ in young, low-mass galaxies to $\sim
10\,{\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ for older, massive ones. At this redshift, SERRA galaxies
are typically bursty, i.e. they are located above the Schmidt-Kennicutt
relation by a factor $\kappa_s = 3.03^{+4.9}_{-1.8}$, consistent with recent
findings for [OIII] and [CII] emitters at high-$z$. They also show relatively
large ${\rm IRX} = L_{\rm FIR}/L_{\rm UV}$ values as a result of their
compact/clumpy morphology effectively blocking the stellar UV luminosity. Note
that this conclusion might be affected by insufficient spatial resolution at
the molecular cloud level. We confirm that early galaxies lie on the standard
$\rm [CII]-SFR$ relation; their observed $L_{\rm [OIII]}/L_{\rm [CII]} \simeq
1-10$ ratios can be reproduced by a part of the SERRA galaxies without the need
of a top-heavy IMF and/or anomalous C/O abundances. [OI] line intensities are
similar to local ones, making ALMA high-$z$ detections challenging but feasible

Title:Constraining Warm Dark Matter and Pop III stars with the Global 21-cm Signal,"
Abstract:  Upcoming ground and space-based experiments may have sufficient accuracy to
place significant constraints upon high-redshift star formation, Reionization,
and dark matter (DM) using the global 21-cm signal of the intergalactic medium.
In the early universe, when the relative abundance of low-mass DM halos is
important, measuring the global signal would place constraints on the damping
of structure formation caused by DM having a higher relic velocity (warm dark
matter, or WDM) than in cold dark matter (CDM). Such damping, however, can be
mimicked by altering the star formation efficiency (SFE) and difficult to
detect because of the presence of Pop III stars with unknown properties. We
study these various cases and their degeneracies with the WDM mass parameter
$m_X$ using a Fisher matrix analysis. We study the $m_X = 7$ keV case and a
star-formation model that parametrizes the SFE as a strong function of halo
mass and include several variations of this model along with three different
input noise levels for the likelihood; we also use a minimum halo virial
temperature for collapse near the molecular cooling threshold. We find that
when the likelihood includes only Pop II stars, $m_X$ is constrained to an
uncertainty of $\sim 0.4$ keV for all models and noise levels at 68$\%$ CI.
When the likelihood includes weak Pop III stars, $m_X \sim 0.3$ keV, and if Pop
III star formation is relatively efficient, $m_X \sim 0.1$ keV uncertainty,
with tight Pop III star-formation parameter constraints. Our results show that
the global 21-cm signal is a promising test-bed for WDM models, even in the
presence of strong degeneracies with astrophysical parameters.

Title:Spectral-timing of AGN ionized outflows with Athena,"
Abstract:  Spectral-timing techniques have proven valuable in studying the interplay
between the X-ray corona and the accretion disc in variable active galactic
nuclei (AGN). Under certain conditions, photo-ionized outflows emerging from
central AGN regions also play a role in the observable spectral-timing
properties of the nuclear components. The variable ionizing flux causes the
intervening gas to ionize or recombine, resulting in a time-dependent
absorption spectrum. Understanding the spectral-timing properties of these
outflows is critical for the determination of their role in the AGN
environment, but also the correct interpretation of timing signatures of other
AGN components. In this paper, we test the capabilities of the Athena X-IFU
instrument in studying the spectral and spectral-timing properties of a black
hole system displaying a variable outflow. We take the narrow-line Seyfert 1
IRAS 13224-3809 as a test case. Our findings show that while the non-linear
response of the absorbing medium can result in complex behaviour of time lags,
the resulting decrease in the coherence can be used to constrain gas density
and distance to the central source. Ultimately, modelling the coherence spectra
of AGN outflows may constitute a valuable tool in studying the physical
properties of the outflowing gas.

Title:The relevance of ram pressure stripping for the evolution of blue cluster galaxies as seen at optical wavelengths,"
Abstract:  Ram pressure stripping is one of the most efficient mechanisms able to affect
the gas reservoir in cluster galaxies and in the last decades many studies have
characterized the properties of stripped galaxies. A definite census of the
importance of this process in local clusters is though still missing. Here we
characterize the fraction of galaxies showing signs of stripping at optical
wavelengths, using the data of 66 clusters from the WINGS and OMEGAWINGS
surveys. We focus on the infalling galaxy population and hence only consider
blue, bright (B<18.2) late-type spectroscopically confirmed cluster members
within 2 virial radii. In addition to ""traditional"" stripping candidates (SC)
-- i.e. galaxies showing unilateral debris and tails -- we also consider
unwinding galaxies (UG) as potentially stripped galaxies. Recent work has
indeed unveiled a connection between unwinding features and ram pressure
stripping and even though only integral field studies can inform on how often
these features are indeed due to ram pressure, it is important to include them
in the global census. We performed a visual inspection of B-band images and
here we release a catalog of 143 UG. SC and UG each represent ~15-20% of the
inspected sample. If we make the assumption that they both are undergoing ram
pressure stripping, we can conclude that at any given time in the low-z
universe about 35% of the infalling cluster population show signs of stripping
in their morphology at optical wavelengths. These fractions depend on color,
mass, morphology, and little on clustercentric distance. Making some rough
assumptions on the duration of the tail visibility and on the time cluster
galaxies can maintain blue colors, we infer that almost all bright blue
late-type cluster galaxies undergo a stripping phase during their life,
boosting the importance of ram pressure stripping in cluster galaxy evolution.

Title:Angular momentum transport in a contracting stellar radiative zone embedded in a large scale magnetic field,"
Abstract:  Some contracting or expanding stars are thought to host a large-scale
magnetic field in their radiative interior. By interacting with the
contraction-induced flows, such fields may significantly alter the rotational
history of the star. They thus constitute a promising way to address the
problem of angular momentum transport during the rapid phases of stellar
evolution. In this work, we aim at studying the interplay between flows and
magnetic fields in a contracting radiative zone. We propose a scenario that may
account for the post-main sequence evolution of solar-like stars, in which a
quasi-solid rotation can be maintained by a large-scale magnetic field during a
contraction timescale. Then, an axisymmetric instability would destroy this
large-scale structure and enables the differential rotation to set in. Such a
contraction driven instability could also be at the origin of the observed
dichotomy between strongly and weakly magnetic intermediate-mass stars.

Title:Systematic light curve modelling of TDEs: statistical differences between the spectroscopic classes,"
Abstract:  With the sample of observed tidal disruption events (TDEs) now reaching
several tens, distinct spectroscopic classes have emerged: TDEs with only
hydrogen lines (TDE-H), only helium lines (TDE-He), or hydrogen in combination
with He II and often N III/O III (TDE-H+He). Here we model the light curves of
32 optically-bright TDEs using the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients
(MOSFiT) to estimate physical and orbital properties, and look for statistical
differences between the spectroscopic classes. For all types, we find a shallow
distribution of star masses, compared to a typical initial mass function,
between $\sim 0.1-1$ M$_\odot$, and no TDEs with very deep ($\beta \gg 1$)
encounters. Our main result is that TDE-H events appear to come from less
complete disruptions (and possibly lower SMBH masses) than TDE-H+He, with
TDE-He events fully disrupted. We also find that TDE-H events have more
extended photospheres, in agreement with recent literature, and argue that this
could be a consequence of differences in the self-intersection radii of the
debris streams. Finally, we identify an approximately linear correlation
between black hole mass and radiative efficiency. We suggest that TDE-H may be
powered by collision-induced outflows at relatively large radii, while TDE-H+He
could result from prompt accretion disks, formed more efficiently in closer
encounters around more massive SMBHs.

Title:The bulge masses of TDE host galaxies and their scaling with black hole mass,"
Abstract:  Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a means to probe the low end of the
supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass distribution, as they are only observable
below the Hills mass ($\lesssim 10^8$ M$_\odot$). Here we attempt to calibrate
the scaling of SMBH mass with host galaxy bulge mass, enabling SMBH masses to
be estimated for large TDE samples without the need for follow-up observations
or extrapolations of relations based on high-mass samples. We derive host
galaxy masses using Prospector fits to the UV-MIR spectral energy distributions
for the hosts of 29 well-observed TDEs with BH mass estimates from MOSFiT. We
then conduct detailed bulge/disk decomposition using SDSS and PanSTARRS
imaging, and provide a catalog of bulge masses. We measure a positive
correlation between SMBH and bulge mass for the TDE sample, with a power-law
slope of 0.28 and significance $p=0.06$ (Spearmans) and $p=0.05$ (Pearsons),
and an intrinsic scatter of 0.2 dex. Applying MC resampling and bootstrapping,
we find a more conservative estimate of the slope is $0.18\pm0.11$, dominated
by the systematic errors from Prospector and MOSFiT. This is shallower than the
slope at high SMBH mass, which may be due to a bias in the TDE sample towards
lower mass BHs that can more easily disrupt low-mass stars outside of the event
horizon. When combining the TDE sample with that of the high mass regime, we
find that TDEs are successful in extending the SMBH - stellar mass relationship
further down the mass spectrum and provide a relationship across the full range
of SMBH masses.

Title:ExoVista: A Suite of Planetary System Models for Exoplanet Studies,"
Abstract:  Studies of future space- and ground-based exoplanet surveys often rely on
models of planetary systems to simulate instrument response, estimate
scientific yields, perform trade analyses, and study efficient observation
strategies. Until now, no planetary system models contained all of the basic
physics necessary to enable study with all of the major exoplanet detection
methods. Here we introduce a suite of such models generated by a new tool,
exoVista. The exoVista tool quickly generates thousands of models of
quasi-self-consistent planetary systems around known nearby stars at scattered
light wavelengths and efficiently records the position, velocity, spectrum, and
physical parameters of all bodies as functions of time. The modeled planetary
systems can be used to simulate surveys using the direct imaging, transit,
astrometric, and radial velocity techniques, as well as the overlap of these
different methods.

Title:Massive stars dying alone: the remote environment of SN 2010jp and its associated late-time source,"
Abstract:  We present late-time images of the site of the peculiar jet-driven TypeIIn
supernova SN2010jp, including HST images taken 2-5 yr post explosion and deep
ground-based images over a similar time. These are used to characterise its
unusually remote environment and to constrain the progenitor's initial mass and
age. The position of SN2010jp is found to reside along a chain of diffuse
starlight that is probably an outer spiral arm or tidal tail of the interacting
galaxy pair NGC2207/IC2163. There is one bright HII region projected within 1
kpc, and there is faint extended Halpha emission immediately surrounding the
continuum source at the position of SN2010jp, which has $M_{F555W} = -7.7 (\pm
0.2)$ mag. In principle, the lingering light could arise from late-time
circumstellar material (CSM) interaction, an evolved supergiant, a host star
cluster, or some combination of these. Steady flux over 3 yr and a lack of
strong, spatially unresolved Halpha emission make ongoing CSM interaction
unlikely. If an evolved supergiant dominates, its observed luminosity implies
an initial mass of roughly 22 $M_{\odot}$ and an age older than roughly 8 Myr.
If the source is a star cluster, then its colour and absolute magnitude imply
an age of 8-13 Myr and a modest cluster initial mass of log($M/M_{\odot}$) =
3.6-3.8. Extended Halpha emission out to a radius of 30 pc reveals a faint
evolved HII region, pointing to recent star formation with at least one late
O-type star. Based on these various clues, we conclude that the progenitor of
SN2010jp had a likely initial mass of 18-22 $M_{\odot}$.

"Title:Simultaneous High Dynamic Range Algorithm, Testing, and Instrument Simulation","
Abstract:  Within an imaging instrument's field of view, there may be many observational
targets of interest. Similarly, within a spectrograph's bandpass, there may be
many emission lines of interest. The brightness of these targets and lines can
be orders of magnitude different, which poses a challenge to instrument and
mission design. A single exposure can saturate the bright emission and/or have
a low signal to noise ratio (SNR) for faint emission. Traditional high dynamic
range (HDR) techniques solve this problem by either combining multiple
sequential exposures of varied duration or splitting the light to different
sensors. These methods, however, can result in the loss of science capability,
reduced observational efficiency, or increased complexity and cost. The
simultaneous HDR method described in this paper avoids these issues by
utilizing a special type of detector whose rows can be read independently to
define zones that are then composited, resulting in areas with short or long
exposure measured simultaneously. We demonstrate this technique for the sun,
which is bright on disk and faint off disk. We emulated these conditions in the
lab to validate the method. We built an instrument simulator to demonstrate the
method for a realistic solar imager and input. We then calculated SNRs, finding
a value of 45 for a faint coronal mass ejection (CME) and 200 for a bright CME,
both at 3.5 $R_{\odot}$ -- meeting or far exceeding the international standard
for digital photography that defines a SNR of 10 as acceptable and 40 as
excellent. Future missions should consider this type of hardware and technique
in their trade studies for instrument design.

Title:The Near Ultraviolet Transient Surveyor (NUTS): An ultraviolet telescope to observe variable sources,"
Abstract:  Observing the ultraviolet (UV) sky for time-variable phenomena is one of the
many exciting science goals that can be achieved by a relatively small aperture
telescope in space. The Near Ultraviolet Transient Surveyor (NUTS) is a
wide-field ($3^\circ$) imager with a photon-counting detector in the near-UV
(NUV, 200-300 nm), to be flown on an upcoming small satellite mission. It has a
Ritchey-Chretien (RC) telescope design with correction optics to enable
wide-field observations while minimizing optical aberrations. We have used an
intensified CMOS detector with a solar blind photocathode, to be operated in
photon-counting mode. The main science goal of the instrument is the
observation of transient sources in the UV, including flare stars, supernovae,
and active galactic nuclei. NUTS's aperture size and effective area enable
observation of relatively unexplored, brighter parts of the UV sky which are
usually not accessible to larger missions. We have designed, fabricated, and
assembled the instrument, and the final calibrations and environmental tests
are being carried out. In this paper, we provide the scientific motivation and
technical overview of the instrument and describe the assembly and calibration
steps.

Title:An Energy Balance Model for Rapidly and Synchronously Rotating Terrestrial Planets,"
Abstract:  This paper describes the Habitable Energy balance model for eXoplaneT
ObseRvations (HEXTOR), which is a model for calculating latitudinal temperature
profiles on Earth and other rapidly rotating planets. HEXTOR includes a lookup
table method for calculating the outgoing infrared radiative flux and planetary
albedo, which provides improvements over other approaches at parameterizing
radiative transfer in an energy balance model. Validation cases are presented
for present-day Earth and other Earth-sized planets with aquaplanet and land
planet conditions from 0 to 45 degrees obliquity. A tidally locked coordinate
system is also implemented in the energy balance model, which enables
calculation of the horizontal temperature profile for planets in synchronous
rotation around low mass stars. This coordinate transformed model is applied to
cases for TRAPPIST-1e as defined by the TRAPPIST Habitable Atmosphere
Intercomparison protocol, which demonstrates better agreement with general
circulation models compared to the latitudinal energy balance model. Advances
in applying energy balance models to exoplanets can be made by using general
circulation models as a benchmark for tuning as well as by conducting
intercomparisions between energy balance models with different physical
parameterizations.

"Title:The First Near-Infrared Transmission Spectrum of HIP 41378 f, a Low-Mass Temperate Jovian World in a Multi-Planet System","
Abstract:  We present a near-infrared transmission spectrum of the long period (P=542
days), temperate ($T_{eq}$=294 K) giant planet HIP 41378 f obtained with the
Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
With a measured mass of 12 $\pm$ 3 $M_{\oplus}$ and a radius of 9.2 $\pm$ 0.1
$R_{\oplus}$, HIP 41378 f has an extremely low bulk density (0.09 $\pm$ 0.02
g/cm$^{3}$). We measure the transit depth with a median precision of 84 ppm in
30 spectrophotometric channels with uniformly-sized widths of 0.018 microns.
Within this level of precision, the spectrum shows no evidence of absorption
from gaseous molecular features between 1.1-1.7 microns. Comparing the observed
transmission spectrum to a suite of 1D
radiative-convective-thermochemical-equilibrium forward models, we rule out
clear, low-metallicity atmospheres and find that the data prefer
high-metallicity atmospheres or models with an additional opacity source such
as high-altitude hazes and/or circumplanetary rings. We explore the ringed
scenario for this planet further by jointly fitting the K2 and HST light curves
to constrain the properties of putative rings. We also assess the possibility
of distinguishing between hazy, ringed, and high-metallicity scenarios at
longer wavelengths with JWST. HIP 41378 f provides a rare opportunity to probe
the atmospheric composition of a cool giant planet spanning the gap between the
Solar System giants, directly imaged planets, and the highly-irradiated hot
Jupiters traditionally studied via transit spectroscopy.

Title:Unsupervised Machine Learning for Exploratory Data Analysis of Exoplanet Transmission Spectra,"
Abstract:  Transit spectroscopy is a powerful tool to decode the chemical composition of
the atmospheres of extrasolar planets. In this paper we focus on unsupervised
techniques for analyzing spectral data from transiting exoplanets. We
demonstrate methods for i) cleaning and validating the data, ii) initial
exploratory data analysis based on summary statistics (estimates of location
and variability), iii) exploring and quantifying the existing correlations in
the data, iv) pre-processing and linearly transforming the data to its
principal components, v) dimensionality reduction and manifold learning, vi)
clustering and anomaly detection, vii) visualization and interpretation of the
data. To illustrate the proposed unsupervised methodology, we use a well-known
public benchmark data set of synthetic transit spectra. We show that there is a
high degree of correlation in the spectral data, which calls for appropriate
low-dimensional representations. We explore a number of different techniques
for such dimensionality reduction and identify several suitable options in
terms of summary statistics, principal components, etc. We uncover interesting
structures in the principal component basis, namely, well-defined branches
corresponding to different chemical regimes of the underlying atmospheres. We
demonstrate that those branches can be successfully recovered with a K-means
clustering algorithm in fully unsupervised fashion. We advocate for a
three-dimensional representation of the spectroscopic data in terms of the
first three principal components, in order to reveal the existing structure in
the data and quickly characterize the chemical class of a planet.

Title:The Circumgalactic Medium from the CAMELS Simulations: Forecasting Constraints on Feedback Processes from Future Sunyaev-Zeldovich Observations,"
Abstract:  The cycle of baryons through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is important to
understand in the context of galaxy formation and evolution. In this study we
forecast constraints on the feedback processes heating the CGM with current and
future Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) observations. To constrain these processes, we
use a suite of cosmological simulations, the Cosmology and Astrophysics with
MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS), that varies four different feedback
parameters of two previously existing hydrodynamical simulations, IllustrisTNG
and SIMBA. We capture the dependencies of SZ radial profiles on these feedback
parameters with an emulator, calculate their derivatives, and forecast future
constraints on these feedback parameters from upcoming experiments. We find
that for a DESI-like (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) galaxy sample
observed by the Simons Observatory all four feedback parameters are able to be
constrained (some within the $10\%$ level), indicating that future observations
will be able to further restrict the parameter space for these sub-grid models.
Given the modeled galaxy sample and forecasted errors in this work, we find
that the inner SZ profiles contribute more to the constraining power than the
outer profiles. Finally, we find that, despite the wide range of AGN feedback
parameter variation in the CAMELS simulation suite, we cannot reproduce the tSZ
signal of galaxies selected by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey as
measured by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.

Title:Dynamical Implantation of Blue Binaries in the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt,"
Abstract:  Colors and binarity provide important constraints on the Kuiper belt
formation. The cold classical objects at radial distance r=42-47 au from the
Sun are predominantly very red (spectral slope s>17%) and often exist as
equal-size binaries (~30% observed binary fraction). This has been taken as
evidence for the in-situ formation of cold classicals. Interestingly, a small
fraction (~10%) of cold classicals is less red with s<17%, and these ""blue""
bodies are often found in wide binaries. Here we study the dynamical
implantation of blue binaries from r<42 au. We find that they can be implanted
into the cold classical belt from a wide range of initial radial distances, but
the survival of the widest blue binaries -- 2001 QW322 and 2003 UN284 --
implies formation at r>30 au. This would be consistent with the hypothesized
less-red to very-red transition at 30<r<40 au. For any reasonable choice of
parameters (Neptune's migration history, initial disk profile, etc.), however,
our model predicts a predominance of blue singles, rather than blue binaries,
which contradicts existing observations. We suggest that wide blue binaries
formed in situ at r=42-47 au and their color reflects early formation in a
protoplanetary gas disk. The predominantly VR colors of cold classicals may be
related to the production of methanol and other hydrocarbons during the late
stages of the disk, when the temperature at 45 au dropped to 20 K and carbon
monoxide was hydrogenated.

Title:Optical Variability of Quasars with 20-Year Photometric Light Curves,"
Abstract:  We study the optical $gri$ photometric variability of a sample of 190 quasars
within the SDSS Stripe 82 region that have long-term photometric coverage
during $\sim 1998-2020$ with SDSS, PanSTARRS-1, the Dark Energy Survey, and
dedicated follow-up monitoring with Blanco 4m/DECam. With on average $\sim 200$
nightly epochs per quasar per filter band, we improve the parameter constraints
from a Damped Random Walk (DRW) model fit to the light curves over previous
studies with 10-15 yr baselines and $\lesssim 100$ epochs. We find that the
average damping timescale $\tau_{\rm DRW}$ continues to rise with increased
baseline, reaching a median value of $\sim 750$ days ($g$ band) in the
rest-frame of these quasars using the 20-yr light curves. Some quasars may have
gradual, long-term trends in their light curves, suggesting that either the DRW
fit requires very long baselines to converge, or that the underlying
variability is more complex than a single DRW process for these quasars. Using
a subset of quasars with better-constrained $\tau_{\rm DRW}$ (less than 20\% of
the baseline), we confirm a weak wavelength dependence of $\tau_{\rm
DRW}\propto \lambda^{0.51\pm0.20}$. We further quantify optical variability of
these quasars over days to decades timescales using structure function (SF) and
power spectrum density (PSD) analyses. The SF and PSD measurements
qualitatively confirm the measured (hundreds of days) damping timescales from
the DRW fits. However, the ensemble PSD is steeper than that of a DRW on
timescales less than $\sim$ a month for these luminous quasars, and this second
break point correlates with the longer DRW damping timescale.

Title:How many extra-Galactic stellar-mass binary black holes will be detected by space gravitational-wave interferometers?,"
Abstract:  On the basis of GWTC-3, we discuss the detection prospect of extra-Galactic
binary black holes (BBHs) by space gravitational-wave interferometers. In
particular, targeting BBHs with component masses around 5-100$M_\odot$, we
directly incorporate the chirp mass distribution of the 62 BBHs detected at
high significance. We find that, due to the reduction of both the comoving
merger rate and a weighted average of chirp masses, the expected detection
numbers are generally much smaller than the results obtained by the same
authors immediately after the report of GW150914. For LISA, the total BBH
detections are estimated to be $N_{\rm tot}\sim 2 (T/4{\rm yr})^{3/2}(\rho_{\rm
thr}/10)^{-3}$, dominated by nearly monochromatic BBHs ($\rho_{\rm thr}$: the
detection threshold, $T$: the observational period). TianQin will have a total
detection number $N_{\rm tot}$ similar to LISA. Meanwhile, TianQin has
potential to find $N_{\rm mer}\sim0.6 (T/4{\rm yr})^{7/4}(\rho_{\rm
thr}/10)^{-3}$ BBHs that merge in the observational period. This number for
merging BBHs is 4-5 times larger than that of LISA, because of the difference
between the optimal bands. We also investigate prospects for joint operations
of multiple detectors, finding that concurrent observations will be more
advantageous than sequential ones.

obtained with the effective temperature $T_{\rm eff,1} = 8990 \pm 200$ K and
the rotational rate $v_1\sin$$i=53\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$ for the more massive
primary. The RV measurements were analyzed with archival WASP photometry. From
the modelling we obtained: $M_1 = 1.745 \pm 0.013$ M$_\odot$, $M_2 = 0.187 \pm
0.002$ M$_\odot$, $R_1 = 1.626 \pm 0.008$ M$_\odot$, $R_2 = 0.290 \pm 0.003$
M$_\odot$, $L_1 = 15.5 \pm 1.4$ L$_\odot$, and $L_2 = 1.84 \pm 0.16$ L$_\odot$.
In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, WASP 1625-04 A lies on the zero-age main
sequence and its companion accords well with the helium-core white dwarf models
of 0.19 M$_\odot$ in the constant luminosity phase. Our improved results
demonstrate that WASP 1625-04 is a typical EL CVn-type binary with a low mass
ratio and $M_2$ combination in the thin-disk population and is the product of
the stable, non-conservative mass transfer of the precursor binary.

Title:A Framework for Characterizing Transmission Spectra of Exoplanets with Circumplanetary Rings,"
Abstract:  Recent observations revealed that several extremely low-density exoplanets
show featureless transmission spectra. While atmospheric aerosols are a
promising explanation for both the low density and featureless spectra, there
is another attractive possibility: the presence of circumplanetary rings.
Previous studies suggested that rings cause anomalously large transit radii.
However, it remains poorly understood how rings affect the transmission
spectrum. Here, we provide a framework to characterize the transmission spectra
of ringed exoplanets. We develop an analytical prescription to include rings in
the transmission spectra for arbitrarily viewing geometries. We also establish
a simple post-processing model that can include the ring's effects on
precomputed ring-free spectra. The ring flattens the transmission spectrum for
a wide range of viewing geometries, consistent with the featureless spectra of
extremely low-density exoplanets. Near-future observations by JWST at longer
wavelengths would be able to distinguish the aerosol and ring scenarios. We
also find that rocky rings might cause a silicate feature at $\sim$10 $\mu$m if
the ring's optical depth is around unity. Thus, the ring's spectral features,
if detected, would provide tight constrains on the physical properties of
exoplanetary rings. We also discuss the ring's stability and suggest that thick
rings are sustainable only at the equilibrium temperature of $\lesssim$300 K
for the ring's age comparable to Kepler planets. This might indicate the
intrinsic deficit of thick rings in the Kepler samples, unless rings are much
younger than the planets as suggested for Saturn.

"Title:Configuration of the Martian dust rings: Shapes, densities and size-distributions from direct integrations of particle trajectories","
Abstract:  It is expected since the early 1970s that tenuous dust rings are formed by
grains ejected from the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos by impacts of
hypervelocity interplanetary projectiles. In this paper, we perform direct
numerical integrations of a large number of dust particles originating from
Phobos and Deimos. In the numerical simulations, the most relevant forces
acting on dust are included: Martian gravity with spherical harmonics up to 5th
degree and 5th order, gravitational perturbations from the Sun, Phobos, and
Deimos, solar radiation pressure, as well as the Poynting-Robertson drag. In
order to obtain the ring configuration, simulation results of various grain
sizes ranging from submicron to 100 microns are averaged over a specified
initial mass distribution of ejecta. We find that for the Phobos ring grains
smaller than about 2 microns are dominant; while the Deimos ring is dominated
by dust in the size range of about 5-20 microns. The asymmetries, number
densities and geometrical optical depths of the rings are quantified from
simulations. The results are compared with the upper limits of the optical
depth inferred from Hubble observations. We compare to previous work and
discuss the uncertainties of the models.

Abstract:  The technetium-rich (Tc-rich) M stars reported in the literature
(Little-Marenin & Little (1979); Uttenthaler et al. (2013)) are puzzling
objects since no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than a few
million years, and 99Tc, the longest-lived isotope along the s-process path, is
expected to be detected only in thermally-pulsing stars enriched with other
s-process elements (like zirconium). Carbon should also be enriched, since it
is dredged up at the same time, after each thermal pulse on the asymptotic
giant branch (AGB). However, these Tc-enriched objects are classified as M
stars, meaning that they neither have any significant zirconium enhancement
(otherwise they would be tagged as S-type stars) nor any large carbon
overabundance (in which case they would be carbon stars). Here we present the
first detailed chemical analysis of a Tc-rich M-type star, namely S Her. We
first confirm the detection of the Tc lines, and then analyze its carbon and
s-process abundances, and draw conclusions on its evolutionary status.
Understanding these Tc-rich M stars is an important step to constrain the
threshold luminosity for the first occurrence of the third dredge-up and the
composition of s-process ejecta during the very first thermal pulses on the
AGB.

Abstract:  The surface brightness profiles (SBPs) of star clusters hold invaluable
information on the dynamical state of clusters. The observed SBPs of star
clusters, especially that of globular clusters, are in good agreement with the
SBPs expected for isothermal spheres containing stars of reduced kinetic
energies. However, the SBPs of configurations that satisfy these theoretical
criteria cannot be uniquely expressed by analytical formulae, which had
hindered the analysis of dynamical state of observed clusters in external
galaxies. To counter this shortcoming, it has become a practice to use
empirical fitting formulae that best represent the core and halo
characteristics of theoretical models. We here present a general purpose code,
named nProFit, that allows fitting of the surface brightness profiles of
extragalactic star clusters to theoretical star clusters, defined by dynamical
models of King (1966) and Wilson (1975). In addition, we also incorporated
theoretical models that result in power-law surface brightness profiles
represented by Elson et al. 1987. The code returns the basic size parameters
such as core radius, half-light radius and tidal radius, as well as dynamically
relevant parameters, such as the volume and surface density profiles, velocity
dispersion profile, total mass and the binding energy for a user-fixed
mass-to-light ratio. The usefulness of the code in the dynamical study of
extragalactic clusters has been already illustrated in Cuevas-Otahola et al.
2020. The code, which is python-based at the user end, but makes calls to
advanced routines in Pyraf and Fortran, is now available for public use. We
provide example scripts and mock clusters in the installation package as guide
to users.

Title:Self-consistent grain depletions and abundances I: The Orion Nebula as a test case,"
Abstract:  Atomic species in the interstellar medium (ISM) transition out of their gas
phase mainly by depletion onto dust. In this study, we examine if there is any
change to the spectral line ratio predictions from a photoionization model of
the Orion H II region when the degree of dust depletions is altered according
to the most recently published model. We use equations and parameters published
by previous works, in order to streamline the calculation of depleted
abundances within CLOUDY. Our aim is for CLOUDY users to be able to vary the
level of depletion using a single parameter in the input file. This makes it
possible to explore predictions for a large range of depletions more
efficiently. Finally, we discuss the results obtained for a model of the Orion
Nebula when the degree of depletions are manipulated in this way. We found that
the intensity of line ratios are significantly affected by depletions onto dust
grains. Further, we found that adjusting dust abundances along with depletion
affects the structure and the overall temperature of the H$^+$ layer across the
H II region.

Title:The Mystery of Unidentified Infrared Emission Bands,"
Abstract:  A family of unidentified infrared emission (UIE) bands has been observed
throughout the Universe. The current observed spectral properties of the UIE
bands are summarized. These properties are discussed in the frameworks of
different models of the chemical carriers of these bands. The UIE carriers
represent a large reservoir of carbon in the Universe, and play a significant
role in the physical and chemical processes in the interstellar medium and
galactic environment. A correct identification of the carrier of the UIE bands
is needed to use these bands as probes of galactic evolution.

Title:Homologous Coronal Mass Ejections Caused by Recurring Formation and Disruption of Current Sheet within a Sheared Magnetic Arcade,"
Abstract:  The Sun often produces coronal mass ejections with similar structure
repeatedly from the same source region, and how these homologous eruptions are
initiated remains an open question. Here, by using a new magnetohydrodynamic
simulation, we show that homologous solar eruptions can be efficiently produced
by recurring formation and disruption of coronal current sheet as driven by
continuously shearing of the same polarity inversion line within a single
bipolar configuration. These eruptions are initiated by the same mechanism, in
which an internal current sheet forms slowly in a gradually sheared bipolar
field and reconnection of the current sheet triggers and drives the eruption.
Each of the eruptions does not release all the free energy but with a large
amount left in the post-flare arcade below the erupting flux rope. Thus, a new
current sheet can be more easily formed by further shearing of the post-flare
arcade than by shearing a potential field arcade, and this is favorable for
producing the next eruption. Furthermore, it is found that the new eruption is
stronger since the newly formed current sheet has a larger current density and
a lower height. In addition, our results also indicate the existence of a
magnetic energy threshold for a given flux distribution, and eruption occurs
once this threshold is approached.

Title:The Absence of Periodicity in Repeating FRB,"
Abstract:  Popular Fast Radio Burst models involve rotating magnetized neutron stars,
yet no rotational periodicities have been found. Small datasets exclude exact
periodicity in FRB 121102. Recent observations of over 1500 bursts from each of
FRB 121102 and FRB 20201124A also have not found periodicity. Periodograms of
events with cosine-distributed random offsets as large as $\pm 0.6 P$ from a
strict period $P$ would still reveal the underlying periodicity. The
sensitivity of periodograms of long data series, such as bursts observed on
multiple days, to slow frequency drifts is mitigated by considering individual
observing sessions, and results are shown for FRB 121102. Models of repeating
FRB without intrinsic periodicity are considered, as are models of apparently
non-repeating FRB.

Title:Evolution of short-period cataclysmic variables: implications from eclipse modeling and stage A superhump method (with New Year's gift),"
Abstract:  In 2013, the method of determining mass ratios of dwarf novae using stage A
superhumps (growing superhumps) was established. This method is a dynamical one
in that it relies only on celestial mechanics. It is not dependent on an
experimental calibration. Since then, more than 100 objects have been measured
by this method. In this paper, I provide an updated description of the method.
Comparisons with the results of the modern eclipse modeling method, which is
considered to be the golden standard, have shown that these two methods agree
very well and the stage A superhump method has been confirmed to be as accurate
and as reliable as the modern eclipse modeling method. The number of the object
by the former methods is now a few time those by the latter method, and the
former is indispensable to study the terminal evolution of cataclysmic
variables. I also showed that past studies by the other groups assumed
incorrect fractional superhump excess relations, causing biases in discussing
the evolution. I also derived a new experimental relation for stage B
superhumps. The updated evolutionary track around the period minimum suggests
that the angular momentum loss is 1.9 times larger than expected by
gravitational wave radiation. The measurements of stage A superhumps greatly
owe to international collaborations with amateurs and professionals. There is
similarity with the world of ornithology in that both play a role in uniting
the world via international exchanges of observations. I describe a summary of
these collaborations and describe my thoughts about the relation between
astronomy and ornithology, and give prospects how multidisciplinary works can
be made possible between these seemingly distant fields of science (abridged).

Title:On the structure and long-term evolution of ice-rich bodies,"
Abstract:  The interest in the structure of ice-rich planetary bodies, in particular the
differentiation between ice and rock, has grown due to the discovery of Kuiper
belt objects and exoplanets. We thus carry out a parameter study for a range of
planetary masses $M$, yielding radii $50 \aplt R \aplt 3000$~km, and for
rock/ice mass ratios between 0.25 and 4, evolving them for 4.5~Gyr in a cold
environment, to obtain the present structure. We use a thermal evolution model
that allows for liquid and vapor flow in a porous medium, solving mass and
energy conservation equations under hydrostatic equilibrium for a spherical
body in orbit around a central star. The model includes the effect of pressure
on porosity and on the melting temperature, heating by long-lived radioactive
isotopes, and temperature-dependent serpentinization and dehydration. We obtain
the boundary in parameter space [size, rock-content] between bodies that
differentiate, forming a rocky core, and those which remain undifferentiated:
small bodies, bodies with a low rock content, and the largest bodies
considered, which develop high internal pressures and barely attain the melting
temperature. The final differentiated structure comprises a rocky core, an
ice-rich mantle, and a thin dense crust below the surface. We obtain and
discuss the bulk density-radius relationship. The effect of a very cold
environment is investigated and we find that at an ambient temperature of
$\sim$20~K, small bodies preserve the ice in amorphous form to the present.

Title:Protostellar Outflows: a window to the past,"
Abstract:  During the early phases of low-mass star formation, episodic accretion causes
the ejection of high-velocity outflow bullets, which carry a fossil record of
the driving protostar's accretion history. We present 44 SPH simulations of
$1\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ cores, covering a wide range of initial conditions, and
follow the cores for five free-fall times. Individual protostars are
represented by sink particles, and the sink particles launch episodic outflows
using a subgrid model. The Optics algorithm is used to identify individual
episodic bullets within the outflows. The parameters of the overall outflow and
the individual bullets are then used to estimate the age and energetics of the
outflow, and the accretion events that triggered it; and to evaluate how
reliable these estimates are, if observational uncertainties and selection
effects (like inclination) are neglected. Of the commonly used methods for
estimating outflow ages, it appears that those based on the length and speed of
advance of the lobe are the most reliable in the early phases of evolution, and
those based on the width of the outflow cavity and the speed of advance are
most reliable during the later phases. We describe a new method that is almost
as accurate as these methods, and reliable throughout the evolution. In
addition we show how the accretion history of the protostar can be accurately
reconstructed from the dynamics of the bullets if each lobe contains at least
two bullets. The outflows entrain about ten times more mass than originally
ejected by the protostar.

Title:Negative and Positive Feedback from a Supernova Remnant with SHREC: A detailed Study of the Shocked Gas in IC443,"
Abstract:  Supernova remnants (SNRs) contribute to regulate the star formation
efficiency and evolution of galaxies. As they expand into the interstellar
medium (ISM), they transfer vast amounts of energy and momentum that displace,
compress and heat the surrounding material. Despite the extensive work in
galaxy evolution models, it remains to be observationally validated to what
extent the molecular ISM is affected by the interaction with SNRs. We use the
first results of the ESO-ARO Public Spectroscopic Survey SHREC, to investigate
the shock interaction between the SNR IC443 and the nearby molecular clump G.
We use high sensitivity SiO(2-1) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1-0) maps obtained by SHREC
together with SiO(1-0) observations obtained with the 40m telescope at the
Yebes Observatory. We find that the bulk of the SiO emission is arising from
the ongoing shock interaction between IC443 and clump G. The shocked gas shows
a well ordered kinematic structure, with velocities blue-shifted with respect
to the central velocity of the SNR, similar to what observed toward other
SNR-cloud interaction sites. The shock compression enhances the molecular gas
density, n(H$_2$), up to $>$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$, a factor of >10 higher than the
ambient gas density and similar to values required to ignite star formation.
Finally, we estimate that up to 50\% of the momentum injected by IC443 is
transferred to the interacting molecular material. Therefore the molecular ISM
may represent an important momentum carrier in sites of SNR-cloud interactions.

Title:Eccentric dust ring formation in Kozai-Lidov gas disks,"
Abstract:  A highly misaligned gas disk around one component of a binary star system can
undergo global Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations for which the disk inclination and
eccentricity are exchanged. With hydrodynamical simulations of a gas and dust
disk we explore the effects of these oscillations on the dust density
distribution. For dust that is marginally coupled to the gas (${\rm St} \approx
1$), we find that the dust undergoes similar dynamical behaviour to the gas
disk but the radial distribution of dust may be very different to the gas. The
inward radial drift of the dust is faster in an eccentric disk leading to a
smaller outer dust disk radius. The dust breaks into multiple narrow eccentric
rings during the highly eccentric disk phase. Eccentric dust ring formation may
have significant implications for the formation of planets in misaligned disks.
We suggest that multiple dust rings may generally occur within gas disks that
have sufficiently strong eccentricity peaks at intermediate radii.

Title:Disk Tearing Leads to Low and High Frequency Quasi Periodic Oscillations in a GRMHD Simulation of a Thin Accretion Disk,"
Abstract:  Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) display a wide range of variability
phenomena, from long duration spectral state changes to short-term broadband
variability and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). A particularly puzzling
aspect is the production of QPOs, which -- if properly understood -- could be
used as a powerful diagnostic tool of black hole accretion and evolution. In
this work we analyse a high resolution three-dimensional general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin accretion disk which is
tilted by $65^{\circ}$ with respect to the black hole spin axis. We find that
the Lense-Thirring torque from the rapidly spinning 10 $M_\odot$ black hole
causes several sub-disks to tear off within $\sim 10-20$ gravitational radii.
Tearing occurs in cycles on timescales of seconds. During each tearing cycle
the inner sub-disk precesses for 1-5 periods before it falls into the black
hole. We find a precession frequency of $\sim 3\rm Hz$, consistent with
observed low-frequency QPOs. In addition, we find a high frequency QPO (HFQPO)
with centroid frequency of $\sim55$Hz in the power spectra of the mass-weighted
radius of the inner disk. This signal is caused by radial epicyclic
oscillations of a dense ring of gas at the tearing radius, which strongly
suggests a corresponding modulation of the X-ray lightcurve and may thus
explain some of the observed HFQPOs.

Abstract:  MAGRATHEA is an open-source planet structure code that considers the case of

maximum of four layers of iron, silicates, water, and ideal gas. With a few
exceptions, the temperature profile can be chosen between isothermal,
isentropic, and user-defined functions. The user has many options for the phase
diagram and equation of state in each layer and we document how to add
additional equations of state. We present MAGRATHEA's capabilities and discuss

Title:The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Peculiar Velocity Catalogue,"
Abstract:  We present a new catalogue of distances and peculiar velocities (PVs) of
$34,059$ early-type galaxies derived from Fundamental Plane (FP) measurements
using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This
$7016\,\mathrm{deg}^{2}$ homogeneous sample comprises the largest set of
peculiar velocities produced to date and extends the reach of PV surveys up to
a redshift limit of $z=0.1$. Our SDSS-based FP distance measurements have a
mean uncertainty of 23%. Alongside the data, we produce an ensemble of 2,048
mock galaxy catalogues that reproduce the data selection function, and are used
to validate our fitting pipelines and check for systematic errors. We uncover a
significant trend between group richness and mean surface brightness within the
sample, which may hint at an environmental dependence within the FP or the
presence of unresolved systematics, and can result in biased peculiar
velocities. This is removed using multiple FP fits as function of group
richness, a procedure made tractable through a new analytic derivation for the
integral of a 3D Gaussian over non-trivial limits. Our catalogue is calibrated
to the zero-point of the CosmicFlows-III sample with an uncertainty of $0.004$
dex (not including cosmic variance or the error within CosmicFlows-III itself),
which is validated using independent cross-checks with the predicted zero-point
from the 2M++ reconstruction of our local velocity field. Finally, as an
example of what is possible with our new catalogue, we obtain preliminary bulk
flow measurements up to a depth of $135\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. We find a
slightly larger-than-expected bulk flow at high redshift, although this could
be caused by the presence of the Shapley supercluster which lies outside the
SDSS PV footprint.

Title:Systematic biases when using deep neural networks for annotating large catalogs of astronomical images,"
Abstract:  Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have become the most common
solution for automatic image annotation due to their non-parametric nature,
good performance, and their accessibility through libraries such as TensorFlow.
Among other fields, DCNNs are also a common approach to the annotation of large
astronomical image databases acquired by digital sky surveys. One of the main
downsides of DCNNs is the complex non-intuitive rules that make DCNNs act as a
``black box"", providing annotations in a manner that is unclear to the user.
Therefore, the user is often not able to know what information is used by the
DCNNs for the classification. Here we demonstrate that the training of a DCNN
is sensitive to the context of the training data such as the location of the
objects in the sky. We show that for basic classification of elliptical and
spiral galaxies, the sky location of the galaxies used for training affects the
behavior of the algorithm, and leads to a small but consistent and
statistically significant bias. That bias exhibits itself in the form of
cosmological-scale anisotropy in the distribution of basic galaxy morphology.
Therefore, while DCNNs are powerful tools for annotating images of extended
sources, the construction of training sets for galaxy morphology should take
into consideration more aspects than the visual appearance of the object. In
any case, catalogs created with deep neural networks that exhibit signs of
cosmological anisotropy should be interpreted with the possibility of
consistent bias.

Title:The age gradients of galaxies in EAGLE: outside-in quenching as the origin of young bulges in cluster galaxies,"
Abstract:  Many disc galaxies in clusters have been found with bulges of similar age or
younger than their surrounding discs, at odds with field galaxies of similar
morphology and their expected inside-out formation. We use the EAGLE
simulations to test potential origins for this difference in field and cluster
galaxies. We find, in agreement with observations, that on average
disc-dominated field galaxies in the simulations have older inner regions,
while similar galaxies in groups and clusters have similarly aged or younger
inner regions. This environmental difference is a result of outside-in
quenching of the cluster galaxies. Prior to group/cluster infall, galaxies of a
given present-day mass and morphology exhibit a similar evolution in their
specific star formation rate (sSFR) profiles. Post-infall, the outer sSFRs of
group and cluster galaxies significantly decrease due to interstellar medium
stripping, while the central sSFR remains similar to field galaxies. Field disc
galaxies instead generally retain radially increasing sSFR profiles. Thus,
field galaxies continue to develop negative age gradients (younger discs),
while cluster galaxies instead develop positive age gradients (younger bulges).

sources that are likely accretion-powered. Accretion onto compact objects

Title:Statistical Study on the Sources of Jovian Decametric Radio Emissions Based on the Radio Observations of Remote Instruments,"
Abstract:  To better understand the physical processes associated with Jovian decametric
(DAM) radio emissions, we present the statistical study of DAMs and inferred
characteristics of DAM sources based on multi-view observation from Wind and
STEREO spacecraft. The distribution of the apparent rotation speed of DAMs
derived from multiple spacecraft suggests that the rotation speed of Io-related
DAMs is in range of 0.15-0.6{\Omega}_J and that of non-Io-DAMs is between
0.7-1.2{\Omega}_J. Based on the method of Wang et al. (2020), we locate the
sources of the DAMs and infer their emission angles and associated electron
energies. The statistical results show that the DAM source locations have three
preferred regions, two in the southern hemisphere and one in the northern
hemisphere, which is probably caused by the non-symmetrical topology of
Jupiter's magnetic field. The difference between Io-DAM source footprints and
Io auroral spots changes with the Io's position in longitude, consistent with
the previous results from Hess et al. (2010), Bonfond et al. (2017) and Hinton
et al. (2019). In addition, the emission angles for non-Io-DAMs are smaller
than that for Io-DAMs from the same source regions and all the emission angles
range from 60 to 85. Correspondingly, the electron energy is mainly
distributed between 0.5 and 20 keV.

Title:Quantitative Characterization of Magnetic Flux Rope Properties for Two Solar Eruption Events,"
Abstract:  In order to bridge the gap between heliospheric and solar observations of
coronal mass ejections (CMEs), one of the key steps is to improve the
understanding of their corresponding magnetic structures like the magnetic flux
ropes (MFRs). But it remains a challenge to confirm the existence of a coherent
MFR before or upon the CME eruption on the Sun and to quantitatively
characterize the CME-MFR due to the lack of direct magnetic field measurement
in the corona. In this study, we investigate the MFR structures, originating
from two active regions (ARs), AR 11719 and AR 12158, and estimate their
magnetic properties quantitatively. We perform the nonlinear force-free field
extrapolations with preprocessed photospheric vector magnetograms. In addition,
remote-sensing observations are employed to find indirect evidence of MFRs on
the Sun and to analyze the time evolution of magnetic reconnection flux
associated with the flare ribbons during the eruption. A coherent
""pre-existing"" MFR structure prior to the flare eruption is identified
quantitatively for one event from the combined analysis of the extrapolation
and observation. Then the characteristics of MFRs for two events on the Sun
before and during the eruption, forming the CME-MFR, including the axial
magnetic flux, field-line twist, and reconnection flux, are estimated and
compared with the corresponding in situ modeling results. We find that the
magnetic reconnection associated with the accompanying flares for both events
injects significant amount of flux into the erupted CME-MFRs.

Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH), the Two Micron All Sky Survey
(2MASS) and the near-infrared $YJK_{\rm{S}}$ VISTA survey of the Magellanic
Clouds system (VMC), we have obtained multi-band photometric stellar samples
containing over 6 million stars in the LMC and SMC area. Based on the
measurements of the proper motions and parallaxes of the individual stars from
Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3), we have built clean samples that contain
stars from the LMC, SMC and Milky Way (MW), respectively. We apply the spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting to the individual sample stars to estimate
their reddening values. As a result, we have derived the best-fitting reddening
values of ~ 1.9 million stars in the LMC, 1.5 million stars in the SMC and 0.6
million stars in the MW, which are used to construct dust reddening maps in the
MCs. Our maps are consistent with those from the literature. The resultant
high-resolution dust maps in the MCs are not only important tools for reddening
correction of sources in the MCs, but also fundamental for the studies of the
distribution and properties of dust in the two galaxies.

Title:Science Potential for Stellar-mass Black Holes as Neighbors of Sgr A*,"
Abstract:  It has been suggested that there is possibly a class of stellar-mass black
holes (BHs) residing near (distance $\le 10^3 M$) the galactic center massive
black hole, Sgr A*. Possible formation scenarios include the mass segregation
of massive stellar-mass black holes and/or the disk migration if there was an
active accretion flow near Sgr A* within $\mathcal{O}(10)$ Myr. In this work,
we explore the application of this type of objects as sources of space-borne
gravitational wave detectors, such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA). We find it is possible to probe the spin of Sgr A* based on the
precession of the orbital planes of these stellar-mass black holes moving
around Sgr A*. We also show that the dynamical friction produced by accumulated
cold dark matter near Sgr A* generally produces small measurable phase shift in
the gravitational waveform. In the case that there is an axion cloud near Sgr
A*, the dynamical friction induced modification to gravitational waveform is
measurable only if the mass of the axion field is in a narrow range of the mass
spectrum. Gravitational interaction between the axion cloud and the
stellar-mass black holes may introduce additional precession around the spin of
Sgr A*. This additional precession rate is generally weaker than the
spin-induced Lense-Thirring precession rate, but nevertheless may contaminate
the spin measurement in a certain parameter regime. At last, we point out that
the multi-body gravitational interaction between these stellar-mass black holes
generally causes negligible phase shift during the LISA lifetime.

Title:Star Formation Properties of Sloan Digital Sky Survey BOSS Void Galaxies in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey,"
Abstract:  We utilize the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Wide Survey to explore the properties
of galaxies located in the voids identified from the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) up to z~0.7. The HSC reaches i~25, allowing us to
characterize the void galaxies down to 10$^{9.2}$ solar mass. We find that the
revised void galaxy densities, when including faint galaxies in voids defined
by bright galaxies, are still underdense compared to the mean density from the
entire field. In addition, we classify galaxies into star-forming, quiescent,
and green valley populations, and find that void galaxies tend to have slightly
higher fractions of star-forming galaxies under the mass and redshift control,
although the significance of this result is only moderate (2$\sigma$). However,
when we focus on the star-forming population, the distribution of the specific
star formation rate (sSFR) of void galaxies shows little difference from that
of the control galaxies. Similarly, the median sSFR of star-forming void
galaxies is also in good agreement with that of the star-forming control
galaxies. Moreover, the effective green valley fraction of void galaxies,
defined as the number of green valley galaxies over the number of nonquiescent
galaxies, is comparable to that of the control ones, supporting the suggestion
that void and control galaxies evolve under similar physical processes and
quenching frequencies. Our results thus favor a scenario of the galaxy assembly
bias.

the periphery of galaxy clusters originating from cluster mergers. Some radio
relics show a highly polarised emission, which make relics an excellent probe
for the magnetisation of the intra-cluster medium. The origin of the relic
polarisation is still debated. It could be a result of tangentially stretching
the magnetic field at the shock surface. This scenario would naturally explain
the alignment of the polarisation (E-vectors) with the shock normal. We have
implemented a toy model for the relic polarisation according to this scenario.
We find that the magnetic field strength itself crucially affects the
fractional polarisation. Moreover, we find that the shock strength has
surprisingly little effect on the overall polarisation fraction. Finally, we
find that the fractional polarisation may decrease downstream depending on the
magnetic field strength. Our results demonstrates that the shock compression
scenario provides a very plausible explanation for the radio relic polarisation
which specific features permitting to test the origin of radio relic
polarisation.

Title:Evidence for Gamma-Ray Pulsations from the Classical Nova ASASSN-16ma,"
Abstract:  We report here a new result extracted from the Fermi Large Area Telescope
observation of the classical nova ASASSN-16ma that exhibits coherent gamma-ray
pulsations at 544.84(7) seconds during its outburst in 2016. Considering the
number of independent trials, the significance of the evidence is 4.0 sigma,
equivalent to a false alarm probability of 5.9e-5. The periodicity was steady
during the 4 days of its appearance, indicating its origin as the spinning
signal of the white dwarf. Given that the optical and gamma-ray light curves of
some shock-powered gamma-ray novae have been recently shown closely correlated
to each other, the gamma-ray pulsation phenomenon likely implies an existence
of the associated optical pulsations, which would provide detailed ephemerides
for these extreme white dwarf binaries for further investigations in the near
future.

Title:disnht: modeling X-ray absorption from distributed column densities,"
Abstract:  Collecting and analysing X-ray photons over either spatial or temporal scales
encompassing varying optical depth values requires knowledge about the optical
depth distribution. In the case of sufficiently broad optical depth
distribution, assuming a single column density value leads to a misleading
interpretation of the source emission properties, nominally its spectral model.
We present a model description for the interstellar medium absorption in X-ray
spectra at moderate energy resolution, extracted over spatial or temporal
regions encompassing a set of independent column densities. The absorption
model (named disnht) approximates the distribution with a lognormal one and is
presented in table format. The solution table and source code are made
available and can be further generalized or tailored for arbitrary optical
depth distributions encompassed by the extraction region. The disnht absorption
model presented and its generalized solution are expected to be relevant for
present and upcoming large angular scale analyses of diffuse X-ray emission,
such as the ones from the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope
Array (eROSITA) and the future Athena missions.

"Title:Astrophysical Parameters from Gaia DR2, 2MASS & AllWISE","
Abstract:  Stellar physical and dynamical properties are essential knowledge to
understanding the structure, formation, and evolution of our Galaxy. We
produced an all-sky uniformly derived catalog of stellar astrophysical
parameters (APs; age, mass, temperature, bolometric luminosity, distance, dust
extinction) to give insight into the physical properties of Milky-Way stars.
Exploiting the power of multi-wavelength and multi-survey observations from
Gaia DR2 parallaxes and integrated photometry along with 2MASS and AllWISE
photometry, we introduce an all-sky uniformly derived catalog of stellar
astrophysical parameters, including dust extinction (A0) and average grain size
(R0) along the line of sight, for 123,097,070 stars. In contrast with previous
works, we do not use a Galactic model as prior in our analysis. We validate our
results against other literature (e.g., benchmark stars, interferometry,
Bayestar, StarHorse). The limited optical information in the Gaia photometric
bands or the lack of ultraviolet or spectroscopic information renders the
chemistry inference prior dominated. We demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes bring
sufficient leverage to explore the detailed structures of the interstellar
medium in our Milky Way. In Gaia DR3, we will obtain the dispersed optical
light information to break through some limitations of this analysis, allowing
us to infer stellar chemistry in particular. Gaia promises us data to construct
the most detailed view of the chemo-dynamics of field star populations in our
Galaxy.

Title:Collision-induced satellite in the blue wing of the Balmer-beta line and consequences on the Balmer series,"
Abstract:  In this paper we emphasize the non-Lorentzian behavior of the Balmer series
in helium-dominated DBA white dwarf stars for which the decades-old problem
exists for the determination of the hydrogen abundance. In a very recent work,
we have shown that quasi-molecular line satellites due to H-He and H-H
collisions are responsible for the asymmetrical shape of the Lyman-alpha lines
observed with the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) and that a similar asymmetry
exists for the Balmer-alpha line profiles. In continuation with very recent
work, where the n=2, 3 potential energies and transition dipole moments from
the ground state were determined, here, we present accurate H-He potential
energies and electronic transition dipole moments concerning the molecular
states correlated with H(n=4)+He and their transition dipole moments with the
states correlated with H(n=2)+He. Those new data are used to provide a
theoretical investigation of the collisional effects in the blue wing of the
Balmer-beta line of H perturbed by He. Because of the general trend
characterizing the repulsive Sigma states of the potential energies involved in
the Balmer series, the amplitude in the core of the line is decreasing very
fast with the order of the series when the helium density gets as large as
10^21 cm^-3. This study is undertaken by applying a unified theory of spectral
line broadening that is valid at very high helium densities found in DZA white
dwarf stars.
The treatment includes collision-induced (CI) line satellites due to
asymptotically forbidden transitions, and it explains the asymmetry observed in
their spectra.

Title:Investigating the Origin of Observed Central Dips in Radial Metallicity Profiles,"
Abstract:  Radial metallicity trends provide a key indicator of physical processes such
as star formation and radial gas migration within a galaxy. Large IFU surveys
allow for detailed studies of these radial variations, with recent observations
detecting central dips in the metallicity, which may trace the impact of
various evolutionary processes. However, the origin of these dips has not been
conclusively determined, with suggestions that they may be diagnostic
dependent. In this paper, we use the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey to investigate
whether the observed dips represent genuine decreases in the central
metallicity, or if they could be an artefact of the diagnostic used. Using a
sub-sample of 758 local star-forming galaxies at low inclinations, we
investigate in detail the impact of using different strong line diagnostics on
the shapes of the returned profiles, and the prevalence of dips. We find no
clear evidence of the dips being caused by changing values of the ionisation
parameter within galaxies. To investigate physical causes, we explore both
global and spatially-resolved parameters, finding that galaxies exhibiting
central dips in the O3N2 metallicity profile have on average lower H$\alpha$EW
values out to $R/R_\rm{e} \sim 1.5$, and higher values of D$_N$(4000) in the
central regions. We additionally find a higher prevalence of dips in galaxies
with high stellar mass, and lower values of global specific star formation
rate, suggesting a possible link to central quenching. Nevertheless, these
results are dependent on the diagnostic used, suggesting caution should be
taken when interpreting observed features in galaxy metallicity gradients.

Title:Constraining branon dark matter from observations of the Segue 1 dwarf spheroidal galaxy with the MAGIC telescopes,"
Abstract:  We present the first search for signatures of brane-world extra-dimensional
dark matter (DM) in the very-high-energy gamma-ray band by scrutinizing
observations of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Segue 1 with the Major Atmospheric
Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope system. Branons are new degrees of
freedom that appear within flexible brane-world models: they are weakly
interacting massive particles and natural DM candidates. The ground-based
gamma-ray telescopes MAGIC could indirectly detect branon DM in the multi-TeV
mass range by observing secondary products of DM annihilation into Standard
Model particles. In the absence of a signal, we place constraints on the branon
DM parameter space by using a binned likelihood analysis of almost 160-hours
deep exposure on the Segue 1 dwarf spheroidal galaxy by the MAGIC telescopes.
Our most stringent limit to the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section
(at $95\%$ confidence level) corresponds to $ \langle \sigma v \rangle \simeq
1.4 \times 10^{-23}~\text{cm}^{3}\text{s}^{-1} $ at a branon mass of $ \sim
0.7~\text{TeV}$.

Title:Exploring delaying and heating effects on the 21-cm signature of fuzzy dark matter,"
Abstract:  In the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) model, dark matter is composed of ultra-light
particles with a de Broglie wavelength of $\sim$kpc, above which it behaves
like cold dark matter (CDM). Due to this, FDM suppresses the growth of
structure on small scales, which delays the onset of the cosmic dawn (CD) and
the subsequent epoch of reionization (EoR). This leaves potential signatures in
the sky averaged 21-cm signal (global), as well as in the 21-cm fluctuations,
which can be sought for with ongoing and future 21-cm global and intensity
mapping experiments. To do so reliably, it is crucial to include effects such
as the dark-matter/baryon relative velocity and Lyman-Werner star-formation
feedback, which also act as delaying mechanisms, as well as CMB and \lya
heating effects, which can significantly change the amplitude and timing of the
signal, depending on the strength of X-ray heating sourced by the remnants of
the first stars. Here we model the 21-cm signal in FDM cosmologies across CD
and EoR using a modified version of the public code 21cmvFAST that accounts for
all these additional effects, and is directly interfaced with the Boltzmann
code CLASS so that degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical
parameters can be fully explored. We examine the prospects to distinguish
between the CDM and FDM models and forecast joint astrophysical, cosmological
and FDM parameter constraints achievable with intensity mapping experiments
such as HERA and global signal experiments like EDGES. We find that HERA will
be able to detect FDM particle masses up to $m_{\rm FDM}\! \sim
\!10^{-19}\,{\rm eV}\!-\!10^{-18}\,{\rm eV}$, depending on foreground
assumptions, despite the mitigating effect of the delaying and heating
mechanisms included in the analysis.

Title:Constraining giant planet formation with synthetic ALMA images of the Solar System's natal protoplanetary disk,"
Abstract:  New ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks allow us to probe planet
formation in other systems, giving us new constraints on planet formation
processes. Meanwhile, studies of our own Solar System rely on constraints
derived in a completely different way. However, it is still unclear what
features the Solar System's disk could have produced during its gas phase. By
running 2D isothermal hydro-simulations and a dust evolution model, we derive
synthetic images at 1.3 mm wavelength using the radiative transfer code
RADMC3D. We find that the embedded multiple giant planets strongly perturb the
radial gas velocities of the disk, creating traffic jams in the dust. They
produce over-densities different from the ones created by pressure traps and
located away from the planets' positions in the disk. By deriving the images at
1.3mm from these dust distributions, we show that the traffic jams, observable
with a high resolution, further blur the link between the number of gaps and
rings in disks and the number of embedded planets. We additionally show that a
system of 3 compact giant planets does not automatically produce bright outer
rings at large radii in the disk. This means that high resolution observations
of disks of various sizes are needed to distinguish between different giant
planet formation scenarios during the disk phase, where the giants form either
in the outer regions of the disks or in the inner regions. Finally, we find
that, even when the dust temperature is determined self-consistently, the dust
masses derived observationally might be off by up to a factor of ten compared
to the dust contained in our simulations due to the creation of optically thick
regions. Our study clearly shows that in addition to the constraints from
exoplanets and the Solar System, ALMA has the power to constrain different
stages of planet formation already during the first few million years.

Title:Deep Learning in Searching the Spectroscopic Redshift of Quasars,"
Abstract:  Studying the cosmological sources at their cosmological rest-frames is
crucial to track the cosmic history and properties of compact objects. In view
of the increasing data volume of existing and upcoming telescopes/detectors, we
here construct a 1--dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) with a
residual neural network (ResNet) structure to estimate the redshift of quasars
in Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) catalog from DR16 quasar-only (DR16Q)
of eBOSS on a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios, named \code{FNet}. Owing
to its $24$ convolutional layers and the ResNet structure with different kernel
sizes of $500$, $200$ and $15$, FNet is able to discover the ""\textit{local}""
and ""\textit{global}"" patterns in the whole sample of spectra by a
self-learning procedure. It reaches the accuracy of 97.0$\%$ for the velocity
difference for redshift, $|\Delta\nu|< 6000~ \rm km/s$ and 98.0$\%$ for
$|\Delta\nu|< 12000~ \rm km/s$. While \code{QuasarNET}, which is a standard CNN
adopted in the SDSS routine and is constructed by 4 convolutional layers (no
ResNet structure), with kernel sizes of $10$, to measure the redshift via
identifying seven emission lines (\textit{local} patterns), fails in estimating
redshift of $\sim 1.3\%$ of visually inspected quasars in DR16Q catalog, and it
gives 97.8$\%$ for $|\Delta\nu|< 6000~ \rm km/s$ and 97.9$\%$ for $|\Delta\nu|<
12000~ \rm km/s$. Hence, FNet provides similar accuracy to \code{QuasarNET},
but it is applicable for a wider range of SDSS spectra, especially for those
missing the clear emission lines exploited by \code{QuasarNET}. These
properties of \code{FNet}, together with the fast predictive power of machine
learning, allow \code{FNet} to be a more accurate alternative for the pipeline
redshift estimator and can make it practical in the upcoming catalogs to reduce
the number of spectra to visually inspect.

Title:Accretion variability from minutes to decade timescales in the classical T Tauri star CR Cha,"
Abstract:  Classical T Tauri stars are surrounded by a circumstellar disk from which
they are accreting material. This process is essential in the formation of
Sun-like stars. Although often described with simple and static models, the
accretion process is inherently time variable. Our aim is to examine the
accretion process of the low-mass young stellar object CR Cha on a wide range
of timescales from minutes to a decade by analyzing both photometric and
spectroscopic observations from 2006, 2018, and 2019. We carried out period
analysis on the light curves of CR Cha from the TESS mission and the ASAS-SN
and the ASAS-3 databases. We studied the color variations of the system using
$I,J,H,K$-band photometry obtained contemporaneously with the TESS observing
window. We analyzed the amplitude, timescale, and the morphology of the
accretion tracers found in a series of high-resolution spectra obtained in 2006
with the AAT/UCLES, in 2018 with the HARPS, and in 2019 with the ESPRESSO and
the FEROS spectrographs. All photometric data reveal periodic variations
compatible with a 2.327 days rotational period, which is stable in the system
over decades. Moreover, the ASAS-SN and ASAS-3 data hint at a long-term
brightening by 0.2 mag, between 2001 and 2008, and of slightly less than 0.1
mag in the 2015 - 2018 period. The near-infrared color variations can be
explained by either changing accretion rate or changes in the inner disk
structure. Our results show that the amplitude of the variations in the
H$\alpha$ emission increases on timescales from hours to days/weeks, after
which it stays similar even when looking at decadal timescales. On the other
hand, we found significant morphological variations on yearly/decadal
timescales, indicating that the different physical mechanisms responsible for
the line profile changes, such as accretion or wind, are present to varying
degrees at different times.

Title:Simulation Study of the Relative Askaryan Fraction at the South Pole,"
Abstract:  We use CoREAS simulations to study the ratio of geomagnetic and Askaryan
radio emission from cosmic-ray air showers at the location of the South Pole.
The fraction of Askaryan emission relative to the total emission is determined
by the polarization of the radio signal at the time of its peak amplitude. We
find that the relative Askaryan fraction has a radial dependence increasing
with the distance from the shower axis -- with a plateau around the Cherenkov
ring. We further find that the Askaryan fraction depends on shower parameters
like zenith angle and the distance to the shower maximum. While these
dependencies are in agreement with earlier studies, they have not yet been
utilized to determine the depth of the shower maximum, $X_\mathrm{max}$, based
on the Askaryan fraction. Fitting these dependencies with a polynomial model,
we arrive at an alternative method to reconstruct $X_\mathrm{max}$ using a
measurement of the Askaryan fraction and shower geometry as input. Depending on
the measurement uncertainties of the Askaryan fraction, this method provides a
measurement of $X_{\mathrm max}$ with a resolution similar to other methods of
reconstructing $X_{\mathrm max}$ from radio observables. Although existing
template methods give superior resolution, they are more computationally
intensive. Consequently, the use of polarization to extract the Askaryan
fraction of the radio signal should be considered as an additional input
observable in future generations of template-fitting reconstruction and other
multivariate approaches for measuring $X_{\mathrm max}$.

Title:BeyondPlanck X. Bandpass and beam leakage corrections,"
Abstract:  We discuss the treatment of bandpass and beam leakage corrections in the
Bayesian BeyondPlanck CMB analysis pipeline as applied to the Planck LFI
measurements. As a preparatory step, we first apply three corrections to the
nominal LFI bandpass profiles including removal of a known systematic effect in
the ground measuring equipment at 61 GHz; smoothing of standing wave ripples;
and edge regularization. The main net impact of these modifications is an
overall shift in the 70 GHz bandpass of +0.6 GHz; we argue that any analysis of
LFI data products, either from Planck or BeyondPlanck, should use these new
bandpasses. In addition, we fit a single free bandpass parameter for each
radiometer of the form $\Delta_i = \Delta_0 + \delta_i$, where $\Delta_0$
represents an absolute frequency shift per frequency band and $\delta_i$ is a
relative shift per detector. The absolute correction is only fitted at 30 GHz
with a full $\chi^2$-based likelihood, resulting in a correction of
$\Delta_{30}=0.24\pm0.03\,$GHz. The relative corrections are fitted using a
spurious map approach, fundamentally similar to the method pioneered by the
WMAP team, but without introducing many additional degrees of freedom. All
bandpass parameters are sampled using a standard Metropolis sampler within the
main BeyondPlanck Gibbs chain, and bandpass uncertainties are thus propagated
to all other data products in the analysis. In total, we find that our bandpass
model significantly reduces leakage effects. For beam leakage corrections, we
adopt the official Planck LFI beam estimates without additional degrees of
freedom, and only marginalize over the underlying sky model. We note that this
is the first time leakage from beam mismatch has been included for Planck LFI
maps.

Title:Searching for dark-matter waves with PPTA and QUIJOTE pulsar polarimetry,"
Abstract:  The polarization of photons emitted by astrophysical sources might be altered
as they travel through a dark matter medium composed of ultra light axion-like
particles (ALPs). In particular, the coherent oscillations of the ALP
background in the galactic halo induce a periodic change on the polarization of
the electromagnetic radiation emitted by local sources such as pulsars.
Building up on previous works, we develop a new, more robust, analysis based on
the generalised Lomb-Scargle periodogram to search for this periodic signal in
the emission of the Crab supernova remnant observed by the QUIJOTE MFI
instrument and 20 galactic pulsars from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA)
project. We also carefully take into account the stochastic nature of the axion
field, an effect often overlooked in previous works. This refined analysis
leads to the strongest limits on the axion-photon coupling for a wide range of
dark matter masses spanning $10^{-23}\text{ eV}\lesssim m_a\lesssim10^{-19}
\text{ eV}$. Finally, we survey possible optimal targets and the potential
sensitivity to axionic dark-matter in this mass range that could be achieved
using pulsar polarimetry in the future.

Title:A train of shocks at 3000 au scale? Exploring the clash of an expanding bubble into the NGC 1333 IRAS 4 region. SOLIS XIV,"
Abstract:  There is evidence that the star formation process is linked to the intricate
net of filaments in molecular clouds, which may be also due to gas compression
from external triggers. We studied the southern region of the Perseus NGC 1333
molecular cloud, known to be heavily shaped by similar external triggers, to
shed light on the process that perturbed the filament where the Class 0 IRAS4
protostars lie. We use new IRAM-NOEMA observations of SiO and CH3OH, both known
to trace violent events as shocks, toward IRAS 4A as part of the Large Program
Seeds Of Life in Space (SOLIS). We detected three parallel elongated ($>$6000
au) structures, called fingers, with narrow line profiles (~1.5 $km s^{-1}$)
peaked at the cloud systemic velocity, tracing gas with high density (5-20
$10^5 cm^{-3}$) and high temperature (80-160 K). They are chemically different,
with the northern finger traced by both SiO and CH3OH ([CH3OH]/[SiO]~160-300),
while the other two only by SiO ([CH3OH]/[SiO]$<$ 40). Among various
possibilities, a train of three shocks, distanced by $>$5000 yr, would be
consistent with the observations if a substantial fraction of silicon, frozen
onto the grain mantles, is released by the shocks.We suggest that the shock
train is due to an expanding gas bubble, coming behind NGC 1333 from the
southwest and clashing against the filament, where IRAS 4A lies. Finally, we
propose a solution to the two-decades long debate on the nature and origin of
the widespread narrow SiO emission observed in the south part of NGC 1333,
namely that it is due to unresolved trains of shocks.

Title:Atomic diffusion in solar-like stars with MESA. Comparison with the Montreal/Montpellier and CESTAM stellar evolution codes,"
Abstract:  The stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics
(MESA) is public and is widely used by the community. It includes the
possibility of taking several non-standard processes such as atomic diffusion
into account. Even if the effect of gravitational settling is considered a
standard ingredient in stellar modelling today, this is not the case for
radiative accelerations. The specific treatment of atomic diffusion along with
the radiative accelerations has never been compared with other stellar
evolution codes. Benchmarking these codes is important because improved
accuracy is required in order to analyse data from present and future space
missions, such as the \textit{Kepler}, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
(TESS), and PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) missions.
The aim of this paper is to compare MESA models including atomic diffusion
(with radiative accelerations) with models computed with the
Montreal/Montpellier stellar evolution code and with the Code d'Evolution
Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire (CESTAM). Additionally, we assess the impact
of some MESA options related to atomic diffusion.
We calculated atomic diffusion, including radiative accelerations, following
the abundance profiles of 14 elements with MESA models. This was then compared
with 1.1 and 1.4~$M_{\odot}$ models computed with the Montreal/Montpellier and
CESTAM codes. Various tests of MESA options for atomic diffusion were also
carried out by varying only one of them at a time.
We find that the abundance profiles of the considered elements in the MESA
models compare rather well with the models computed with the two other codes
when atomic diffusion options are carefully set. We also show that some options
in MESA are crucial for a proper treatment of atomic diffusion.

Title:First images of phosphorus molecules towards a proto-Solar analog,"
Abstract:  The chemistry of phosphorus in star- and planet-forming regions is poorly
understood, despite the central role of phosphorus in terrestrial biochemistry.
We present ALMA Band 3 and 4 observations of PO and PN towards the Class I
protostar B1-a, representing the first spatially resolved observations of
phosphorus carriers towards a Solar-type star forming region. The phosphorus
molecules emit from two distinct clumps, which coincide with regions where the
protostellar outflow (traced by SiO) interacts with a filament of dense gas
(traced by CCS). Thus, the gas-phase phosphorus seems to originate from the
shocking of dense interstellar clumps. Based on the observed emission patterns,
PO and PN appear to be daughter products of a solid phosphorus carrier with an
intermediate volatility between ices and silicate grains. Interstellar shocks
may therefore play an important role in converting semi-refractory phosphorus
to a more volatile form prior to incorporation into cometary ices. Indeed, the
(PO+PN)/CH3OH ratio is similar in B1-a and comet 67P, implying a comparable
reservoir of volatile phosphorus. The PO/PN ratio ranges from ~1-8 across B1-a.
The northern emission clump exhibits a lower PO/PN ratio and weaker 13CH3OH
emission than southern clump, indicating distinct shock physics and chemistry
at the two positions. Resolved observations of P carriers towards additional
sources are needed to better understand what regulates such variations in the
PO/PN ratio in protostellar environments.

low-level calculations are handled through an external spherical harmonic

Abstract:  The morphology of haloes inform about both cosmological and galaxy formation

morphology of haloes, only partially captured by smooth density profile, going
beyond the spherical or ellipsoidal symmetry. We employ semi-analytical haloes
with NFW and $\alpha\beta\gamma$-profile and spherical or ellipsoidal shape to
obtain a clear interpretation of MFs as function of inner and outer slope,
concentration and sphericity parameters. We use the same models to mimic the

sensitive to internal substructures. This highlights the benefit of MFs at the
halo scales as promising statistics to improve the spatial modeling of dark
matter, crucial for future lensing, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich, and X-ray mass maps as

(MF) of accreted subhaloes (scaled to the radius and mass of the host halo) and
showed they are essentially universal. This is not the case, however, for those
of stripped subhaloes, which depend on halo mass and assembly history. In Paper
II we derived these latter properties in the simplest case of purely accreting
haloes. Here we extend the study to ordinary haloes having suffered major
mergers. After showing that all the properties of substructure are encoded in
the mean truncated-to-original subhalo mass ratio profile, we demonstrate that
the dependence of the subhalo MF on halo mass arises from their mass-dependent
concentration, while the shape of the subhalo radial distribution depends on
the time of the last major merger of the host halo. In this sense, the latter
property is a better probe of halo formation time than the former.
Unfortunately, this is not the case for the radial distribution of satellites
as this profile is essentially disconnected from subhalo stripping and the
properties of accreted subhaloes are independent of the halo formation time.

Title:BeyondPlanck III. Commander3,"
Abstract:  We describe the computational infrastructure for end-to-end Bayesian CMB
analysis implemented by the BeyondPlanck collaboration. This code is called
commander3, and provides a statistically consistent framework for global
analysis of CMB and microwave observations, and may be useful for a wide range
of legacy, current, and future experiments. The paper has three main goals.
Firstly, we provide a high-level overview of the existing code base, aiming to
guide readers who wish to extend and adapt the code according to their own
needs, or to reimplement it from scratch in a different programming language.
Secondly, we discuss some critical computational challenges that arise within
any global CMB analysis framework, for instance in-memory compression of
time-ordered data, FFT optimization, and parallelization and load-balancing.
Thirdly, we quantify the CPU and RAM requirements for the current BeyondPlanck
analysis, and find that a total of 1.5 TB of RAM is required for efficient
analysis, and the total cost of a full Gibbs sample is 170 CPU-hrs, including
both low-level processing and high-level component separation, which is well
within the capabilities of current low-cost computing facilities. The existing
code base is made publicly available under a GNU General Public Library (GPL)
license.

Title:Formation of Magnetically Truncated Accretion Disks in 3D Radiation-Transport Two-Temperature GRMHD Simulations,"
Abstract:  Multi-wavelength observations suggest that the accretion disk in the hard and
intermediate states of X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN)
transitions from a cold, thin disk at large distances into a hot, thick flow
close to the black hole. However, the formation, structure and dynamics of such
truncated disks are poorly constrained due to the complexity of the
thermodynamic, magnetic, and radiative processes involved. We present the first
radiation-transport two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
(GRMHD) simulations of truncated disks radiating at ~35% of the Eddington
luminosity with and without large-scale poloidal magnetic flux. We demonstrate
that when a geometrically-thin accretion disk is threaded by large-scale net
poloidal magnetic flux, it self-consistently transitions at small radii into a
two-phase medium of cold gas clumps floating through a hot, magnetically
dominated corona. This transition occurs at a well-defined truncation radius
determined by the distance out to which the disk is saturated with magnetic
flux. The average ion and electron temperatures in the semi-opaque corona
reach, respectively, T_i ~ 10^10K and T_e ~ 5 10^8K. The system produces
radiation, powerful collimated jets and broader winds at the total energy
efficiency exceeding ~90%, the highest ever energy extraction efficiency from a
spinning black hole by a radiatively efficient flow in a GRMHD simulation. This
is consistent with jetted ejections observed during XRB outbursts. The
two-phase medium may naturally lead to broadened iron line emission observed in
the hard state.

Title:BeyondPlanck XVI. Limits on Large-Scale Polarized Anomalous Microwave Emission from Planck LFI and WMAP,"
Abstract:  We constrain the level of polarized anomalous microwave emission (AME) on
large angular scales using $\textit{Planck}$ LFI and $\textit{WMAP}$
polarization data within a Bayesian CMB analysis framework. We model
synchrotron emission with a power-law spectral energy distribution, and the sum
of AME and thermal dust emission through linear regression with the
$\textit{Planck}$ HFI 353 GHz data. This template-based dust emission model
allows us to constrain the level of polarized AME while making minimal
assumptions on its frequency dependence. We neglect cosmic microwave background
fluctuations, but show through simulations that these have a minor impact on
the results. We find that the resulting AME polarization fraction confidence
limit is sensitive to the polarized synchrotron spectral index prior, and for
priors steeper than $\beta_{\mathrm{s}} = -3.1\pm0.1$ we find an upper limit of
$p_{\mathrm{AME}}^{\rm max}\lesssim 0.6\,\%$ ($95\,\%$ confidence). In
contrast, for $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.0\pm0.1$, we find a nominal detection of
$p_{\mathrm{AME}}=2.5\pm1.0\,\%$ ($95\,\%$ confidence). These data are thus not
strong enough to simultaneously and robustly constrain both polarized
synchrotron emission and AME, and our main result is therefore a constraint on
the AME polarization fraction explicitly as a function of $\beta_\mathrm{s}$.
Combining the current $\textit{Planck}$ and $\textit{WMAP}$ observations with
measurements from high-sensitivity low-frequency experiments such as C-BASS and
QUIJOTE will be critical to improve these limits further.

Title:Aura-3D: A Three-dimensional Atmospheric Retrieval Framework for Exoplanet Transmission Spectra,"
Abstract:  Atmospheric retrievals of exoplanet transmission spectra allow constraints on
the composition and structure of the day-night terminator region. Such
retrievals in the past have typically assumed one-dimensional temperature
structures which were adequate to explain extant observations. However, the
increasing data quality expected from exoplanet spectroscopy with JWST
motivates considerations of multidimensional atmospheric retrievals. We present
AURA-3D, a three-dimensional atmospheric retrieval framework for exoplanet
transmission spectra. AURA-3D includes a forward model that enables rapid
computation of transmission spectra in 3D geometry for a given atmospheric
structure and can, therefore, be used for atmospheric retrievals as well as for
computing spectra from General Circulation Models (GCMs). In order to
efficiently explore the space of possible 3D temperature structures in
retrievals, we develop a parametric 3D pressure-temperature profile which can
accurately represent azimuthally-averaged temperature structures of a range of
hot Jupiter GCMs. We apply our retrieval framework to simulated JWST
observations of hot Jupiter transmission spectra, obtaining accurate estimates
of the day-night temperature variation across the terminator as well as the
abundances of chemical species. We demonstrate an example of a model hot
Jupiter transmission spectrum for which a traditional 1D retrieval of
JWST-quality data returns biased abundance estimates, whereas a retrieval
including a day-night temperature gradient can accurately retrieve the true
abundances. Our forward model also has the capability to include inhomogeneous
chemistry as well as variable clouds/hazes. This new retrieval framework opens
the field to detailed multidimensional atmospheric characterisation using
transmission spectra of exoplanets in the JWST era.

Title:Magnetic field amplification by a plasma cavitation instability in relativistic shock precursors,"
Abstract:  Plasma streaming instabilities play an important role in magnetic field
amplification and particle acceleration in relativistic shocks and their
environments. However, in the far shock precursor region where accelerated
particles constitute a highly relativistic and dilute beam, streaming
instabilities typically become inefficient and operate at very small scales
when compared to the gyroradii of the beam particles. We report on a plasma
cavitation instability that is driven by dilute relativistic beams and can
increase both the magnetic field strength and coherence scale by orders of
magnitude to reach near-equipartition values with the beam energy density. This
instability grows after the development of the Weibel instability and is
associated with the asymmetric response of background leptons and ions to the
beam current. The resulting net inductive electric field drives a strong energy
asymmetry between positively and negatively charged beam species. Large-scale
particle-in-cell simulations are used to verify analytical predictions for the
growth and saturation level of the instability and indicate that it is robust
over a wide range of conditions, including those associated with pair-loaded
plasmas. These results can have important implications for the magnetization
and structure of shocks in gamma-ray bursts, and more generally for magnetic
field amplification and asymmetric scattering of relativistic charged particles
in plasma astrophysical environments.

Title:The BPT Diagram in Cosmological Galaxy Formation Simulations: Understanding the Physics Driving Offsets at High-Redshift,"
Abstract:  The Baldwin, Philips, & Terlevich diagram of [O III]/H$\beta$ vs. [N
II]/H$\alpha$ (hereafter N2-BPT) has long been used as a tool for classifying
galaxies based on the dominant source of ionizing radiation. Recent
observations have demonstrated that galaxies at $z\sim2$ reside offset from
local galaxies in the N2-BPT space. In this paper, we conduct a series of
controlled numerical experiments to understand the potential physical processes
driving this offset. We model nebular line emission in a large sample of
galaxies, taken from the SIMBA cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation
simulation, using the CLOUDY photoionization code to compute the nebular line
luminosities from H II regions. We find that the observed shift toward higher
[O III]/H$\beta$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ values at high redshift arises from
sample selection: when we consider only the most massive galaxies $M_* \sim
10^{10-11} M_\odot$, the offset naturally appears, due to their high
metallicities. We predict that deeper observations that probe lower-mass
galaxies will reveal galaxies that lie on a locus comparable to $z\sim 0$
observations. Even when accounting for sample selection effects, we find that
there is a subtle mismatch between simulations and observations. To resolve
this discrepancy, we investigate the impact of varying ionization parameters, H
II region densities, gas-phase abundance patterns, and increasing radiation
field hardness on N2-BPT diagrams. We find that either decreasing the
ionization parameter or increasing the N/O ratio of galaxies at fixed O/H can
move galaxies along a self-similar arc in N2-BPT space that is occupied by
high-redshift galaxies.

Title:Dark matter annihilation and the Galactic Centre Excess,"
Abstract:  We compare the surface brightness profile and morphology of the Galactic
Centre Excess (GCE) identified in wide-angle $\gamma$-ray maps from the
Fermi-Large Area Telescope to dark matter annihilation predictions derived from
high-resolution $\Lambda$CDM magnetohydrodynamic simulations of galaxy
formation. These simulations produce isolated, disc-dominated galaxies with
structure, stellar populations, gas content, and stellar and halo masses
comparable to those of the Milky Way. For a specific choice of annihilation
cross-section, they agree well with the Fermi-LAT data over the full observed
angular range, $1^{\circ}$ to $15^{\circ}$, whereas their dark-matter only
counterparts, lacking any compression of the inner halo by the gravitational
effects of the baryons, fail to predict emission as centrally concentrated as
observed. These results provide additional support to the hypothesis that the
GCE is produced by annihilating dark matter. If, however, it is produced by a
different mechanism, they imply a strong upper limit on annihilation rates
which can be translated into upper limits on the expected $\gamma$-ray flux not
only from the inner Galaxy but also from any substructure, with or without
stars, in the Galactic halo.

Title:A pair of Sub-Neptunes transiting the bright K-dwarf TOI-1064 characterised with CHEOPS,"
Abstract:  We report the discovery and characterisation of a pair of sub-Neptunes
transiting the bright K-dwarf TOI-1064 (TIC 79748331), initially detected in
TESS photometry. To characterise the system, we performed and retrieved CHEOPS,
TESS, and ground-based photometry, HARPS high-resolution spectroscopy, and
Gemini speckle imaging. We characterise the host star and determine $T_{\rm
eff, \star}=4734\pm67$ K, $R_{\star}=0.726\pm0.007$ $R_{\odot}$, and
$M_{\star}=0.748\pm0.032$ $M_{\odot}$. We present a novel detrending method
based on PSF shape-change modelling and demonstrate its suitability to correct
flux variations in CHEOPS data. We confirm the planetary nature of both bodies
and find that TOI-1064 b has an orbital period of $P_{\rm b}=6.44387\pm0.00003$
d, a radius of $R_{\rm b}=2.59\pm0.04$ $R_{\oplus}$, and a mass of $M_{\rm
b}=13.5_{-1.8}^{+1.7}$ $M_{\oplus}$, whilst TOI-1064 c has an orbital period of
$P_{\rm c}=12.22657^{+0.00005}_{-0.00004}$ d, a radius of $R_{\rm
c}=2.65\pm0.04$ $R_{\oplus}$, and a 3$\sigma$ upper mass limit of 8.5 ${\rm
M_{\oplus}}$. From the high-precision photometry we obtain radius uncertainties
of $\sim$1.6%, allowing us to conduct internal structure and atmospheric escape
modelling. TOI-1064 b is one of the densest, well-characterised sub-Neptunes,
with a tenuous atmosphere that can be explained by the loss of a primordial
envelope following migration through the protoplanetary disc. It is likely that
TOI-1064 c has an extended atmosphere due to the tentative low density, however
further RVs are needed to confirm this scenario and the similar radii,
different masses nature of this system. The high-precision data and modelling
of TOI-1064 b are important for planets in this region of mass-radius space,
and it allows us to identify a trend in bulk density-stellar metallicity for
massive sub-Neptunes that may hint at the formation of this population of
planets.

Title:New constraints on the dark matter density profiles of dwarf galaxies from proper motions of globular cluster streams,"
Abstract:  The central density profiles in low-mass and dwarf galaxy halos depend
strongly on the nature of dark matter. Recently, in Malhan et al. (2021), we
employed N-body simulations to show that the cuspy cold dark matter (CDM)
subhalos predicted by cosmological simulations can be differentiated from cored
subhalos using the properties of accreted globular cluster streams -- those
stellar streams produced from the tidal stripping of globular clusters that
initially evolved within their parent dwarf galaxies and only later merged with
the Milky Way. In particular, we previously found that clusters that are
accreted within cuspy CDM subhalos produce streams with larger physical widths
and higher line-of-sight velocity dispersions as compared to those streams that
accrete inside cored subhalos. Here, we use the same suite of simulations to
demonstrate that the dispersion in the tangential velocity of streams
($\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$) is another parameter that is also sensitive to the
central DM density profile of their parent dwarfs. We find that globular
clusters that were accreted from cuspy CDM subhalos produce streams with larger
$\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$ than those that were accreted inside cored subhalos.
Furthermore, we use Gaia EDR3 observations of multiple GC streams to compare
their $\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$ values with simulations. This comparison
indicates that the five observed streams we analyze are more likely to be
associated with globular clusters of `accreted' rather than `in situ' origin.
We also find evidence that the progenitor globular clusters of these streams
were probably accreted inside cored DM subhalos (with $M_{\rm subhalo}\buildrel
> \over \sim$ $10^{8-9}M_{\odot}$).

Title:Energy functions of fast radio bursts derived from the first CHIME/FRB catalogue,"
Abstract:  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious millisecond pulses in radio, most of
which originate from distant galaxies. Revealing the origin of FRBs is becoming
central in astronomy. The redshift evolution of the FRB energy function, i.e.,
the number density of FRB sources as a function of energy, provides important
implications for the FRB progenitors. Here we show the energy functions of FRBs
selected from the recently released Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
Experiment (CHIME) catalogue using the $V_{\rm max}$ method. The $V_{\rm max}$
method allows us to measure the redshift evolution of the energy functions as
it is without any prior assumption on the evolution. We use a homogeneous
sample of 164 non-repeating FRB sources, which are about one order of magnitude
larger than previously investigated samples. The energy functions of
non-repeating FRBs show Schechter function-like shapes at $z\lesssim1$. The
energy functions and volumetric rates of non-repeating FRBs decrease towards
higher redshifts similar to the cosmic stellar-mass density evolution: there is
no significant difference between the non-repeating FRB rate and cosmic
stellar-mass density evolution with a 1\% significance threshold, whereas the
cosmic star-formation rate scenario is rejected with a more than 99\%
confidence level. Our results indicate that the event rate of non-repeating
FRBs is likely controlled by old populations rather than young populations
which are traced by the cosmic star-formation rate density. This suggests old
populations such as old neutron stars and black holes as more likely
progenitors of non-repeating FRBs.

Title:The variation of the gas content of galaxy groups and pairs compared to isolated galaxies,"
Abstract:  We measure how the atomic gas (HI) fraction ($f_{HI}={\rm
\frac{M_{HI}}{M_{*}}}$) of groups and pairs taken as single units vary with
average stellar mass ($\langle {\rm M_*} \rangle$) and average star-formation
rate ($\langle {\rm SFR} \rangle$), compared to isolated galaxies. The HI 21 cm
emission observation are from (i) archival ALFALFA survey data covering three
fields from the GAMA survey (provides environmental and galaxy properties), and
(ii) DINGO pilot survey data of one of those fields. The mean $f_{HI}$ for
different units (groups/pairs/isolated galaxies) are measured in regions of the
log($\langle {\rm M_*} \rangle$) -- log($\langle {\rm SFR} \rangle$) plane,
relative to the z $\sim 0$ star-forming main sequence (SFMS) of individual
galaxies, by stacking $f_{HI}$ spectra of individual units. For ALFALFA,
$f_{HI}$ spectra of units are measured by extracting HI spectra over the full
groups/pair areas and dividing by the total stellar mass of member galaxies.
For DINGO, $f_{HI}$ spectra of units are measured by co-adding HI spectra of
individual member galaxies, followed by division by their total stellar mass.
For all units the mean $f_{HI}$ decreases as we move to higher $\langle {\rm
M_*} \rangle$ along the SFMS, and as we move from above the SFMS to below it at
any $\langle {\rm M_*} \rangle$. From the DINGO-based study, mean $f_{HI}$ in
groups appears to be lower compared to isolated galaxies for all $\langle {\rm
M_*} \rangle$ along the SFMS. From the ALFALFA-based study we find
substantially higher mean $f_{HI}$ in groups compared to isolated galaxies
(values for pairs being intermediate) for ${\langle{\rm
M_*}\rangle}\lesssim10^{9.5}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$, indicating the presence of
substantial amounts of HI not associated with cataloged member galaxies in low
mass groups.

Title:Systematic exploration of heavy element nucleosynthesis in protomagnetar outflows,"
Abstract:  We study the nucleosynthesis products in neutrino-driven winds from rapidly
rotating, highly magnetised and misaligned protomagnetars using the nuclear
reaction network SkyNet. We adopt a semi-analytic parametrized model for the
protomagnetar and systematically study the capabilities of its neutrino-driven
wind for synthesizing nuclei and eventually producing ultra-high energy cosmic
rays (UHECRs). We find that for neutron-rich outflows ($Y_e<0.5$), synthesis of
heavy elements ($\overline{A}\sim 20-65$) is possible during the first $\sim
10$ seconds of the outflow, but these nuclei are subjected to
composition-altering photodisintegration during the epoch of particle
acceleration at the dissipation radii. However, after the first $\sim 10$
seconds of the outflow, nucleosynthesis reaches lighter elements
($\overline{A}\sim 10-50$) that are not subjected to subsequent
photodisintegration. For proton-rich ($Y_e \geq 0.5$) outflows, synthesis is
more limited ($\overline{A}\sim 4-15$). These suggest that while protomagnetars
typically do not synthesize nuclei heavier than second r-process peak elements,
they are intriguing sources of intermediate/heavy mass UHECRs. For all
configurations, the most rapidly rotating protomagnetars are more conducive for
nucleosynthesis with a weaker dependence on the magnetic field strength.

Title:The combined and respective roles of imaging and stellar kinematics in identifying galaxy merger remnants,"
Abstract:  One of the central challenges to establishing the role of mergers in galaxy
evolution is the selection of pure and complete merger samples in observations.
In particular, while large and reasonably pure interacting galaxy pair samples
can be obtained with relative ease via spectroscopic criteria, automated
selection of post-coalescence merger remnants is restricted to the physical
characteristics of remnants alone. Furthermore, such selection has
predominantly focused on imaging data -- whereas kinematic data may offer a
complimentary basis for identifying merger remnants. Therefore, we examine the
theoretical utility of both the morphological and kinematic features of merger
remnants in distinguishing galaxy merger remnants from other galaxies. Deep
classification models are calibrated and evaluated using idealized synthetic
images and line-of-sight stellar velocity maps of a heterogeneous population of
galaxies and merger remnants from the TNG100 cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation. We show that even idealized stellar kinematic data has limited
utility compared to imaging and under-performs by $2.1\%\pm0.5\%$ in
completeness and $4.7\%\pm0.4\%$ in purity for our fiducial model architecture.
Combining imaging and stellar kinematics offers a small boost in completeness
(by $1.8\%\pm0.4\%$, compared to $92.7\%\pm0.2\%$ from imaging alone) but no
change in purity ($0.1\%\pm0.3\%$ improvement compared to $92.7\%\pm0.2\%$,
evaluated with equal numbers of merger remnant and non-remnant control
galaxies). Classification accuracy of all models is particularly sensitive to
physical companions at separations $\lesssim40$ kpc and to
time-since-coalescence. Taken together, our results show that the stellar
kinematic data has little to offer in compliment to imaging for merger remnant
identification in a heterogeneous galaxy population.

Title:The effect of cosmic variance on the characteristics of dust polarization power spectra,"
Abstract:  In the context of cosmic microwave background polarization studies and the
characterization of the Galactic foregrounds, the power spectrum analysis of
the thermal dust polarization sky has led to intriguing evidence of an E/B
asymmetry and a positive TE correlation. In this work, we produce synthesized
dust polarization maps from a set of global magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations of Milky-Way-sized galaxies, and analyze their power spectra at
intermediate angular scales (angular multipoles $\ell \in \left[60 ,\,
140\right]$). We study the role of the initial configuration of the large-scale
magnetic field, its strength, and the feedback on the power spectrum
characteristics. Using full-galaxy MHD simulations, we were able to estimate
the variance induced by the peculiar location of the observer in the galaxy. We
find that the polarization power spectra sensitively depend on the observer's
location, impeding a distinction between different simulation setups. There is
a clear statistical difference between the power spectra measured from within
the spiral arms and those measured from the inter-arm regions. Also, power
spectra from within supernova-driven bubbles share common characteristics,
regardless of the underlying model. However, no correlation was found between
the properties of the polarization power spectra and the local (with respect to
the observer) mean values of physical quantities such as the density and the
strength of the magnetic field. Finally, we find indications that the global
strength of the magnetic field may play a role in shaping the power spectrum
characteristics; as the global magnetic field strength increases, the E/B
asymmetry and the TE correlation increase, whereas the viewpoint-induced
variance decreases. However, we find no direct correlation with the strength of
the local magnetic field that permeates the mapped region of the interstellar
medium.

Title:Haro 11 -- Untying the knots of the nuclear starburst,"
Abstract:  Star formation is a clustered process that regulates the structure and
evolution of galaxies. We investigate this process in the dwarf galaxy Haro 11,
forming stars in three knots (A, B, C). The exquisite resolution of HST imaging
allows us to resolve the starburst into tens of bright star clusters. We derive
masses between $10^5$ and $10^7\,\rm M_{\odot}$ and ages younger than 20 Myr,
using photometric modeling. We observe that the clustered star formation has
propagated from knot C (the oldest) through knot A (in between) towards knot B
(the youngest). We use aperture-matched ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy
(HST + MUSE) to independently study the stellar populations of Haro 11 and
determine the physical properties of the stellar populations and their feedback
in 1 kpc diameter regions. We discuss these results in light of the properties
of the ionised gas within the knots. We interpret the broad blue-shifted
components of the optical emission lines as outflowing gas ($v_{max} \sim 400$
km/s). The strongest outflow is detected in knot A with a mass-rate of
$\dot{M}_{out}\sim 10\,\rm M_{\odot}/yr$, ten times higher than the
star-formation in the same region. Knot B hosts a young and not fully developed
outflow, whereas knot C has likely been already evacuated. Because Haro 11 has
properties similar to high-redshift unresolved galaxies, our work can
additionally aid the understanding of star formation at high redshift, a window
that will be opened by upcoming facilities.

Title:The chaotic history of the retrograde multi-planet system in K2-290A driven by distant stars,"
Abstract:  The equator of star K2-290A was recently found to be inclined by 124+/-6
degrees relative to the orbits of both its known transiting planets. The
presence of a companion star B at ~100 au suggested that the birth
protoplanetary disk could have tilted, thus providing an explanation for the
peculiar retrograde state of this multi-planet system. In this work, we show
that a primordial misalignment is not required and that the observed retrograde
state is a natural consequence of the chaotic stellar obliquity evolution
driven by a wider-orbit companion C at ~2000 au long after the disk disperses.
The star C drives eccentricity and/or inclination oscillations on the inner
binary orbit, leading to widespread chaos from the periodic resonance passages
between the stellar spin and planetary secular modes. Based on a population
synthesis study, we find that the observed stellar obliquity is reached in
~40-70% of the systems, making this mechanism a robust outcome of the secular
dynamics,regardless of the spin-down history of the central star. This work
highlights the unusual role that very distant companions can have on the orbits
of close-in planets and the host star's spin evolution, connecting four orders
of magnitude in distance scale over billions of orbits. We finally comment on
the application to other exoplanet systems, including multi-planet systems in
wide binaries.

and ${\rm SFR}=23-190\,{\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$) at $z\sim4.5$ with optical
[OII] measurements from Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy and Subaru/MOIRCS narrow-band

combining various measurements in the ultra-violet, optical, and far-infrared
including [CII]$_{158{\rm \mu m}}$ line emission and dust continuum from ALMA
and H$\alpha$ emission from Spitzer photometry. For the first time, this unique
sample allows us to analyze the relation between [OII] and total star-formation
rate (SFR) and the interstellar medium (ISM) properties via [OII]/[CII] and
[OII]/\halpha luminosity ratios at $z\sim4.5$. The [OII]$-$SFR relation at
$z\sim4.5$ cannot be described using standard local descriptions, but is
consistent with a metal-dependent relation assuming metallicities around $50\%$
solar. To explain the measured dust-corrected luminosity ratios of
$L[OII]/L[CII] \sim 0.98^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$ and $L[OII]/LHa \sim
-0.22^{+0.13}_{-0.15}$ for our sample, ionization parameters $\log(U)< -2$ and
electron densities $\log(\rm n_e / {\rm [cm^{-3}]}) \sim 2.5-3$ are required.
The former is consistent with galaxies at $z\sim2-3$, however lower than at
$z>6$. The latter may be slightly higher than expected given the galaxies'

Title:Observational constraints on disc sizes in protoplanetary discs in multiple systems in the Taurus region. II. Gas disc sizes,"
Abstract:  The formation of multiple stellar systems is a natural by-product of the
star-formation process, and its impact on the properties of protoplanetary
discs and on the formation of planets is still to be fully understood. To date,
no detailed uniform study of the gas emission from a sample of protoplanetary
discs around multiple stellar systems has been performed. Here we analyse new
ALMA observations at a $\sim$21 au resolution of the molecular CO gas emission
targeting discs in eight multiple stellar systems in the Taurus star-forming
regions. $^{12}$CO gas emission is detected around all primaries and in seven
companions. With these data, we estimate the inclination and the position angle
for all primary discs and for five secondary or tertiary discs, and measure the
gas disc radii of these objects with a cumulative flux technique on the
spatially resolved zeroth moment images. When considering the radius including
95\% of the flux as a metric, the estimated gas disc size in multiple stellar
systems is found to be on average $\sim 4.2$ times larger than the dust disc
size. This ratio is higher than what was recently found in a population of more
isolated and single systems. On the contrary, when considering the radius
including 68\% of the flux, no difference between multiple and single discs is
found in the distribution of ratios. This discrepancy is due to the sharp
truncation of the outer dusty disc observed in multiple stellar systems. The
measured gas disc sizes are consistent with tidal truncation models in multiple
stellar systems assuming eccentricities of $\sim0.15$-$0.5$, as expected in
typical binary systems.

Title:4FGL J1120.0-2204: A Unique Gamma-ray Bright Neutron Star Binary with an Extremely Low Mass Proto-White Dwarf,"
Abstract:  We have discovered a new X-ray emitting compact binary that is the likely
counterpart to the unassociated Fermi-LAT GeV $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL
J1120.0-2204, the second brightest Fermi source that still remains formally
unidentified. Using optical spectroscopy with the SOAR telescope, we have
identified a warm ($T_{\textrm{eff}}\sim8500$ K) companion in a 15.1-hr orbit
around an unseen primary, which is likely a yet-undiscovered millisecond
pulsar. A precise Gaia parallax shows the binary is nearby, at a distance of
only $\sim 820$ pc. Unlike the typical ""spider"" or white dwarf secondaries in
short-period millisecond pulsar binaries, our observations suggest the $\sim
0.17\,M_{\odot}$ companion is in an intermediate stage, contracting on the way
to becoming an extremely low-mass helium white dwarf (a ""pre-ELM"" white dwarf).
Although the companion is apparently unique among confirmed or candidate
millisecond pulsar binaries, we use binary evolution models to show that in
$\sim 2$ Gyr, the properties of the binary will match those of several
millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries with very short ($< 1$ d) orbital
periods. This makes 4FGL J1120.0-2204 the first system discovered in the
penultimate phase of the millisecond pulsar recycling process.

Title:Limits on Primordial Black Holes from M87,"
Abstract:  Primordial black holes in the solar mass range are a possibly significant
component of dark matter. We show how an argument relating the deflection of
light by such black holes in the density spike likely to exist around the M87
supermassive black hole, combined with the high resolution observations of the
EHT collaboration, can lead to a strong limits on the primordial black hole
mass fraction in an astrophysically relevant mass range. The results depend on
the model assumed for the dark matter spike and suggest the interest of further
understanding of such spikes as well as further high resolution observations on
supermassive black holes.

Title:The ALMaQUEST Survey IX: The nature of the resolved star forming main sequence,"
Abstract:  We investigate the nature of the scaling relations between the surface
density of star formation rate ($\Sigma _{\rm SFR}$), stellar mass ($\Sigma
_*$), and molecular gas mass ($\Sigma _{\rm H_2}$), aiming at distinguishing
between the relations that are primary, i.e. more fundamental, and those which
are instead an indirect by-product of the other relations. We use the ALMaQUEST
survey and analyse the data by using both partial correlations and Random
Forest regression techniques. We unambiguously find that the strongest
intrinsic correlation is between $\Sigma _{\rm SFR}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm H_2}$
(i.e. the resolved Schmidt-Kennicutt relation), followed by the correlation
between $\Sigma _{\rm H_2}$ and $\Sigma _*$ (resolved Molecular Gas Main
Sequence, rMGMS). Once these two correlations are taken into account, we find
that there is no evidence for any intrinsic correlation between $\Sigma _{\rm
SFR}$ and $\Sigma _*$, implying that SFR is entirely driven by the amount of
molecular gas, while its dependence on stellar mass (i.e. the resolved Star
Forming Main Sequence, rSFMS) simply emerges as a consequence of the
relationship between molecular gas and stellar mass.

Title:Characterizing the breakdown of quasi-universality in the post-merger gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers,"
Abstract:  The post-merger gravitational wave (GW) emission from a binary neutron star
merger is expected to provide exciting new constraints on the dense-matter
equation of state (EoS). Such constraints rely, by and large, on the existence
of quasi-universal relations, which relate the peak frequencies of the
post-merger GW spectrum to properties of the neutron star structure in a
model-independent way. In this work, we report on violations of existing
quasi-universal relations between the peak spectral frequency, f_2, and the
stellar radius, for EoSs models with backwards-bending slopes in their
mass-radius relations (such that the radius increases at high masses). The
violations are extreme, with variations in f_2 of up to ~600 Hz between EoSs
that predict the same radius for a 1.4 Msun neutron star, but that have
significantly different radii at higher masses. Quasi-universality can be
restored by adding in a second parameter to the fitting formulae that depends
on the slope of the mass-radius curve. We further find strong evidence that
quasi-universality is better maintained for the radii of very massive stars
(with masses 2 Msun). Both statements imply that f_2 is mainly sensitive to the
high-density EoS. Combined with observations of the binary neutron star
inspiral, these generalized quasi-universal relations can be used to
simultaneously infer the characteristic radius and slope of the neutron star
mass-radius relation.

Title:Black Mirror: The impact of rotational broadening on the search for reflected light from 51 Pegasi b with high resolution spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  The extreme contrast ratios between stars and their planets at optical
wavelengths make it challenging to isolate the light reflected by exoplanet
atmospheres. Yet, these reflective properties reveal key processes occurring in
the atmospheres, and they also span wavelengths that include the potential
O$_2$ biosignature. High resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS)
offers a robust avenue for developing techniques to extract exoplanet
reflection spectra. We aimed to extract the optical reflected light spectrum of
the non-transiting hot Jupiter 51 Peg b by adapting techniques designed to
remove tellurics in infrared HRCCS to instead remove optical stellar lines.
Importantly, we investigated the so far neglected impact of the broadening of
the reflected host star spectrum due to the difference between the stellar
rotation and the planet's orbital velocity. We used 484, R=115000 optical
spectra of 51 Peg b from HARPS-N and HARPS, which we aligned to the exact
stellar rest frame in order to effectively remove the contaminating host star.
However, some stellar residuals remained, likely due to stellar activity. We
cross-correlated with an appropriately broadened synthetic stellar model to
search for the planet's Doppler-shifting spectrum. We detect no significant
reflected light from 51 Peg b and report a S/N=3 upper limit on the contrast
ratio of 76.0 ppm (7.60x10$^{-5}$) when including broadening, and 24.0 ppm
(2.40x10$^{-5}$) without. These upper limits rule out radius and albedo
combinations of previously claimed detections. Broadening can significantly
impact the ability of HRCCS to extract reflected light spectra and must be
considered when determining the contrast ratio, radius, and albedo of the
planet. Asynchronous systems (Prot,$_{\star}\ne$ Porb) are most affected,
including most hot Jupiters as well as Earth-size planets in the traditional
habitable zones of some M-dwarfs.

Title:Origin of young accreting neutron stars in high-mass X-ray binaries in supernova remnants,"
Abstract:  Recently, several accreting neutron stars (NSs) in X-ray binary systems
inside supernova remnants have been discovered. They represent a puzzle for the
standard magneto-rotational evolution of NSs, as their ages ($\lesssim 10^5$
years) are much shorter than the expected duration of Ejector and Propeller
stages preceding the onset of wind accretion. To explain appearance of such
systems, we consider rotational evolution of NSs with early fallback accretion
and asymmetry in forward/backward transitions between Ejector and Propeller
stages (so-called hysteresis effect proposed by V. Shvartsman in 1970). It is
shown that after a successful fallback episode with certain realistic values of
the initial spin period, stellar wind properties, and magnetic field, a young
NS may not enter the Ejector stage during its evolution which results in a
relatively rapid initiation of accretion within the lifetime of a supernova
remnant. For a standard magnetic field $\sim 10^{12}$~G and initial spin period
$\sim 0.1$~--~0.2~s accretion rate $\gtrsim 10^{14}$~--~$10^{15}$~g~s$^{-1}$ is
enough to avoid the Ejector stage.

Title:Constraining the Time of Gravitational Wave Emission from Core-Collapse Supernovae,"
Abstract:  The advent of sensitive gravitational wave (GW) detectors, coupled with
wide-field, high cadence optical time-domain surveys, raises the possibility of
the first joint GW-electromagnetic (EM) detections of core-collapse supernovae
(CCSNe). For targeted searches of GWs from CCSNe optical observations can be
used to increase the sensitivity of the search by restricting the relevant time
interval, defined here as the GW search window (GSW). The extent of the GSW is
a critical factor in determining the achievable false alarm probability (FAP)
for a triggered CCSN search. The ability to constrain the GSW from optical
observations depends on how early a CCSN is detected, as well as the ability to
model the early optical emission. Here we present several approaches to
constrain the GSW, ranging in complexity from model-independent analytical fits
of the early light curve, model-dependent fits of the rising or entire light
curve, and a new data-driven approach using existing well-sampled CCSN light
curves from {\it Kepler} and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).
We use these approaches to determine the time of core-collapse and its
associated uncertainty (i.e., the GSW). We apply our methods to two Type II SNe
that occurred during LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3: SN\,2019fcn and SN\,2019ejj
(both in the same galaxy at $d=15.7$ Mpc). Our approach shortens the duration
of the GSW and improves the robustness of the GSW compared to techniques used
in past GW CCSN searches.

Title:Inflation in a scalar-vector-tensor theory,"
Abstract:  In this work, we study inflation in a particular scalar-vector-tensor theory
of gravitation without the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. The model is constructed from
the more general action introduced in Heisenberg et al. (Phys Rev D 98:024038,
2018) using certain specific choices for the Lagrangians and the coupling
functions. Also, for this model we build the explicit form for the action, and
from it, we derive the general equations: the energy-momentum tensor and the
equations of motion, and using the flat FLRW background, we have analyzed if
it's possible to obtain an inflationary regime with it. Additionally, using
particular choices for the potential, the coupling functions, suitable
dimensionless coupling constants and initial conditions, it was possible verify
numerically that this model of inflation is viable. In this sense, we could
verify that the introduction of the coupling function $f(\phi)$ in our model of
inflation, allows us to reach a suitable amount of $e$-foldings $N$ for
sufficient inflation. This is a remarkable result, since without the coupling
function contribution, the amount of $e$-foldings is smaller at the end of
inflation, as has been demonstrated in Heisenberg et al. (2018). Also, the
no-ghosts and stability conditions that the model during inflation must
satisfy, i.e., absence of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities of linear
cosmological perturbations were obtained, furthermore these conditions were
verified numerically too.

Title:Impact of extreme spins and mass ratios on the post-merger observables of high-mass binary neutron stars,"
Abstract:  The gravitational-wave events GW170817 and GW190425 have led to a number of
important insights on the equation of state of dense matter and the properties
of neutron stars, such as their radii and the maximum mass. Some of these
conclusions have been drawn on the basis of numerical-relativity simulations of
binary neutron-star mergers with vanishing initial spins. While this may be a
reasonable assumption in equal-mass systems, it may be violated in the presence
of large mass asymmetries accompanied by the presence of high spins. To
quantify the impact of high spins on multi-messenger gravitational-wave events,
we have carried out a series of high-mass binary neutron-star mergers with a
highly spinning primary star and large mass asymmetries that have been modelled
self-consistently using two temperature-dependent equations of state. We show
that, when compared with equal-mass, irrotational binaries, these systems can
lead to significant differences in the remnant lifetime, in the dynamical
ejecta, in the remnant disc masses, in the secular ejecta, and on the bulk
kilonova properties. These differences could be exploited to remove the
degeneracy between low- and high-spin priors in the detection of gravitational
waves from binary neutron-star mergers.

Title:Classification of Astrophysics Journal Articles with Machine Learning to Identify Data for NED,"
Abstract:  The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) is a comprehensive online service

the Milky Way and provides value-added, derived quantities and tools to search
and access the data. The contents and relationships between measurements in the
database are continuously augmented and revised to stay current with
astrophysics literature and new sky surveys. The conventional process of
distilling and extracting data from the literature involves human experts to
review the journal articles and determine if an article is of extragalactic
nature, and if so, what types of data it contains. This is both labor intensive
and unsustainable, especially given the ever-increasing number of publications
each year. We present here a machine learning (ML) approach developed and
integrated into the NED production pipeline to help automate the classification
of journal article topics and their data content for inclusion into NED. We
show that this ML application can successfully reproduce the classifications of
a human expert to an accuracy of over 90% in a fraction of the time it takes a
human, allowing us to focus human expertise on tasks that are more difficult to

Title:Estimate of the Mass and Radial Profile of the Orphan-Chenab Stream's Dwarf Galaxy Progenitor Using MilkyWay@home,"
Abstract:  We fit the mass and radial profile of the Orphan-Chenab Stream's (OCS) dwarf
galaxy progenitor by using turnoff stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
and the Dark Energy Camera (DEC) to constrain N-body simulations of the OCS
progenitor falling into the Milky Way on the 1.5 PetaFLOPS MilkyWay@home
distributed supercomputer. We infer the internal structure of the OCS's
progenitor under the assumption that it was a spherically symmetric dwarf
galaxy comprised of a stellar system embedded in an extended dark matter halo.
We optimize the evolution time, the baryonic and dark matter scale radii, and
the baryonic and dark matter masses of the progenitor using a differential
evolution algorithm. The likelihood score for each set of parameters is
determined by comparing the simulated tidal stream to the angular distribution
of OCS stars observed in the sky. We fit the total mass of the OCS's progenitor
to ($2.0\pm0.3$) $\times 10^7 M_\odot$ with a mass-to-light ratio of
$\gamma=73.5\pm10.6$ and ($1.1\pm0.2$)$\times10^6M_{\odot}$ within 300 pc of
its center. Within the progenitor's half-light radius, we estimate total a mass
of ($4.0\pm1.0$)$\times10^5M_{\odot}$. We also fit the current sky position of
the progenitor's remnant to be
$(\alpha,\delta)=((166.0\pm0.9)^\circ,(-11.1\pm2.5)^\circ)$ and show that it is
gravitationally unbound at the present time. The measured progenitor mass is on
the low end of previous measurements, and if confirmed lowers the mass range of
ultrafaint dwarf galaxies. Our optimization assumes a fixed Milky Way
potential, OCS orbit, and radial profile for the progenitor, ignoring the
impact of the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Title:Tidal erasure of stellar obliquities constrains the timing of hot Jupiter formation,"
Abstract:  Stars with hot Jupiters sometimes have high obliquities, which are possible
relics of hot Jupiter formation. Based on the characteristics of systems with
and without high obliquities, it is suspected that obliquities are tidally
damped when the star has a thick convective envelope, as is the case for
main-sequence stars cooler than ~6100K, and the orbit is within ~8 stellar
radii. A promising theory for tidal obliquity damping is the dissipation of
inertial waves within the star's convective envelope. Here, we consider the
implications of this theory for the timing of hot Jupiter formation.
Specifically, hot stars that currently lack a convective envelope possess one
during their pre-main sequence. We find that hot Jupiters orbiting within a
critical distance of ~0.02au from a misaligned main-sequence star lacking a
thick convective envelope must have acquired their tight orbits after a few
tens of millions of years in order to have retained their obliquities
throughout the pre-main-sequence. There are 4 known systems for which this
argument applies--XO-3b, Corot-3b, WASP-14b, and WASP-121b--subject to
uncertainties surrounding inertial wave dissipation. Moreover, we conclude that
a recently-identified overabundance of near-polar hot Jupiters is unlikely
sculpted by tides, instead reflecting their primordial configuration. Finally,
hot Jupiters arriving around cool stars after a few 100s of millions of years
likely find the host star rotating too slowly for efficient obliquity damping.
We predict that the critical effective temperature separating aligned and
misaligned stars should vary with metallicity, from 6300K to 6000K as [Fe/H]
varies from -0.3 to +0.3.

hot dwarfs and blue supergiants. The catalog of ~650,000 stars presented in

not just the Milky Way, but also of the Magellanic clouds, as different type of
objects tracing different parts of these galaxies can be more cleanly selected
through their distinct placement in $T_\mathrm{eff}$-$\log g$ parameter space

well-vetted, candidate James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectrophotometric
standards. Our search of 37 of these candidate standards has revealed
measurable periodic variability in 15 stars. The majority of those show
variability that is less than half a percent; however, four stars are observed
to vary photometrically, from minimum to maximum flux, by more than 1% (the G
dwarf HD 38949 and three fainter A dwarfs). Variability of this size would
likely impact the error budget in the spectrophotometric calibration of the
science instruments aboard JWST. For the 22 candidate standards with no
detected variability, we report upper limits on the observed changes in flux.
Despite some systematic noise, all stars brighter than 12 magnitude in the TESS
band show a 3 sigma upper limit on the total change in brightness of less than
half a percent on time scales between an hour and multiple weeks, empirically
establishing their suitability as spectrophotometric standards. We further
discuss the value and limits of high-cadence, high-precision photometric
monitoring with TESS as a tool to vet the suitability of stars to act as

Title:The Mechanical Alignment of Dust (MAD) I: On the spin-up process of fractal grains by a gas-dust drift,"
Abstract:  Context: Aligned dust grains are commonly exploited to probe the magnetic
field orientation. However, the exact physical processes that result in a
coherent large-scale grain alignment are far from being constrained.
Aims: In this work, we aim to investigate the impact of a gas-dust drift
leading to a mechanical alignment of dust (MAD) and to dust polarization.
Methods: We explore fractal dust aggregates to statistically analyze the
average alignment behavior of distinct grain ensembles. The spin-up
efficiencies for individual aggregates are determined utilizing MC simulations.
These efficiencies are analyzed to identify stable points for the grain
alignment in direction of the gas-dust drift and along the magnetic field
lines. Finally, the net dust polarization is calculated per grain ensemble.
Results: The mechanical spin-up within the CNM is sufficient to drive grains
to a stable alignment. A likely mechanical grain alignment is parallel to the
drift direction. Roundish grains require a supersonic drift while rod-like
grains can align at subsonic conditions. Here, we predict a polarization
efficiency in the order of unity for the MAD. A supersonic drift may result in
a rapid rotation where dust grains may become rotationally disrupted and the
polarization becomes drastically reduces. In the presence of a magnetic field
the drift required for alignment is roughly one order of magnitude higher
compared to the pure MAD. Here, the dust polarization efficiency is 0.8-0.9
indicating that a drift can provide the prerequisites to probe the magnetic
field. The alignment is inefficient when the direction of the drift and the
field lines are perpendicular.
Conclusions: We find that MAD has to be taken into consideration as an
alternative driving mechanism where the standard RAT alignment theory fails to
account for the full spectrum of available dust polarization observations.

Title:Theoretical and Observational Evidence for Coriolis Effects in Coronal Magnetic Fields Via Direct Current Driven Flaring Events,"
Abstract:  All stars produce explosive surface events such as flares and coronal mass
ejections. These events are driven by the release of energy stored in coronal
magnetic fields, generated by the stellar dynamo. However, it remains unclear
if the energy deposition in the magnetic fields is driven by direct or
alternating currents. Recently, we presented observational measurements of the
flare intensity distributions for a sample of $\sim10^5$ stars across the main
sequence observed by $\textit{TESS}$, all of which exhibited power-law
distributions similar to those observed in the Sun, albeit with varying slopes.
Here we investigate the mechanisms required to produce such a distribution of
flaring events via direct current energy deposition, in which coronal magnetic
fields braid, reconnect, and produce flares. We adopt a topological model for
this process which produces a power-law distribution of energetic flaring
events. We expand this model to include the Coriolis effect, which we
demonstrate produces a shallower distribution of flare energies in stars that
rotate more rapidly (corresponding to a weaker decline in occurrence rates
toward increasing flare energies). We present tentative evidence for the
predicted rotation-power-law index correlation in the observations. We advocate
for future observations of stellar flares that would improve our measurements
of the power-law exponents, and yield key insights into the underlying dynamo
mechanisms that underpin the self-similar flare intensity distributions.

Abstract:  Large time-domain surveys provide a unique opportunity to detect and explore
variability of millions of sources on timescales from days to years. Broadband
photometric variability can be used as the key selection criteria for weak

like X-ray or radio emission are unavailable. However, to detect variability of
rather weak AGN powered by intermediate-mass black holes, typical sensitivity
provided by existing light curve databases is insufficient. Here we present an

variability, retrieved from the The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Forced

related to data reduction artefacts and also eliminate long-term trends related
to imperfect photometric calibration. We can now confidently detect the

Abstract:  Modern and future surveys effectively provide a panchromatic view for large
numbers of extragalactic objects. Consistently modeling these multiwavelength
survey data is a critical but challenging task for extragalactic studies. The
Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE) is an efficient PYTHON code for
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of galaxies and active galactic
nuclei (AGNs). Recently, a major extension of CIGALE (named X-CIGALE) has been
developed to account for AGN/galaxy X-ray emission and improve AGN modeling at
UV-to-IR wavelengths. Here, we apply X-CIGALE to different samples, including
COSMOS spectroscopic type 2 AGNs, CDF-S X-ray detected normal galaxies, SDSS
quasars, and COSMOS radio objects. From these tests, we identify several
weaknesses of X-CIGALE and improve the code accordingly. These improvements are
mainly related to AGN intrinsic X-ray anisotropy, X-ray binary emission, AGN
accretion-disk SED shape, and AGN radio emission. These updates improve the fit
quality and allow new interpretation of the results, based on which we discuss
physical implications. For example, we find that AGN intrinsic X-ray anisotropy
is moderate, and can be modeled as $L_X(\theta) \propto 1+\cos \theta$, where
$\theta$ is the viewing angle measured from the AGN axis. We merge the new code
into the major branch of CIGALE, and publicly release this new version as

Title:Physical Properties of 29 sdB+dM Eclipsing Binaries in Zwicky Transient Facility,"
Abstract:  The development of large-scale time-domain surveys provides an opportunity to
study the physical properties as well as the evolutionary scenario of B-type

binaries based on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves and $Gaia$
early data release 3 (EDR3) parallaxes. By using the PHOEBE code for light
curve analysis, we obtain probability distributions for parameters of 29
sdB+dM. $R_1$, $R_2$, and $i$ are well determined, and the average uncertainty
of mass ratio $q$ is 0.08. Our parameters are in good agreement with previous
works if a typical mass of sdB is assumed. Based on parameters of 29 sdB+dM, we
find that both the mass ratio $q$ and the companion's radius $R_2$ decrease
with the shortening of the orbital period. For the three sdB+dMs with orbital

and radii of the companions satisfy the mass--radius relation for low-mass
stars and brown dwarfs. Companions with radii between $0.12R_\odot$ and
$0.15R_\odot$ seem to be missing in the observations. As more short-period
sdB+dM eclipsing binaries are discovered and classified in the future with ZTF

Title:Is FRB 191001 embedded in a supernova remnant?,"
Abstract:  Fast radio burst (FRB) 191001 is localised at the spiral arm of a highly
star-forming galaxy with an observed dispersion measure (DM) of 507 pc
cm$^{-3}$. Subtracting the contributions of the intergalactic medium and our
Milky Way Galaxy from the total DM, one gets an excess of around 200 pc
cm$^{-3}$, which may have been contributed by the host galaxy of the FRB. It is
found in this work that the position of FRB 191001 is consistent with the
distribution of supernovae (SNe) in the spiral arm of their parent galaxies. If
this event is indeed due to an SN explosion, then, from the analysis of the SN
contributions to the excess DM, a core-collapse (CC) channel is preferred over
a thermonuclear runaway. For the CC explosion, depending on the density of the
surrounding medium, the age of the central engine that powers the radio burst
is within a couple of years to a few decades. However, the observed rotation
measure of FRB 191001 does not confirm the fact that the radio burst has passed
through the remnant of a young SN.

Title:Nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability in eccentric disks,"
Abstract:  The magnetorotational instability (MRI) has been extensively studied in
circular magnetized disks, and its ability to drive accretion has been
demonstrated in a multitude of scenarios. There are reasons to expect eccentric
magnetized disks to also exist, but the behavior of the MRI in these disks
remains largely uncharted territory. Here we present the first simulations that
follow the nonlinear development of the MRI in eccentric disks. We find that
the MRI in eccentric disks resembles circular disks in two ways, in the overall
level of saturation and in the dependence of the detailed saturated state on
magnetic topology. However, in contrast with circular disks, the Maxwell stress
in eccentric disks can be negative in some disk sectors, even though the
integrated stress is always positive. The angular momentum flux raises the
eccentricity of the inner parts of the disk and diminishes the same of the
outer parts. Because material accreting onto a black hole from an eccentric
orbit possesses more energy than material tracing the innermost stable circular
orbit, the radiative efficiency of eccentric disks may be significantly lower
than circular disks. This may resolve the ""inverse energy problem"" seen in many
tidal disruption events.

"Title:AT2019azh: an unusually long-lived, radio-bright thermal tidal disruption event","
Abstract:  Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is destroyed by a
supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy, temporarily increasing the
accretion rate onto the black hole and producing a bright flare across the
electromagnetic spectrum. Radio observations of TDEs trace outflows and jets
that may be produced. Radio detections of the outflows from TDEs are uncommon,
with only about one third of TDEs discovered to date having published radio
detections. Here we present over two years of comprehensive, multi-radio
frequency monitoring observations of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh taken
with the Very Large Array (VLA) and MeerKAT radio telescopes from approximately
10 days pre-optical peak to 810 days post-optical peak. AT2019azh shows unusual
radio emission for a thermal TDE, as it brightened very slowly over two years,
and showed fluctuations in the synchrotron energy index of the optically thin
synchrotron emission from 450 days post-disruption. Based on the radio
properties, we deduce that the outflow in this event is likely non-relativistic
and could be explained by a spherical outflow arising from self-stream
intersections, or a mildly collimated outflow from accretion onto the
supermassive black hole. This data-set provides a significant contribution to
the observational database of outflows from TDEs, including the earliest radio
detection of a non-relativistic TDE to date, relative to the optical discovery.

Title:Gamma-ray Burst Prompt Emission Spectrum and $E_p$ Evolution Patterns in the ICMART Model,"
Abstract:  In this paper, we simulate the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) prompt emission light
curve, spectrum and $E_p$ evolution patterns within the framework of the
Internal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model.
We show that this model can produce a Band shape spectrum, whose parameters
($E_p$, $\alpha$, $\beta$) could distribute in the typical distribution from
GRB observations, as long as the magnetic field and the electron acceleration
process in the emission region are under appropriate conditions. On the other
hand, we show that for one ICMART event, $E_p$ evolution is always a
hard-to-soft pattern. However, a GRB light curve is usually composed of
multiple ICMART events that are fundamentally driven by the erratic GRB central
engine activity. In this case, we find that if one individual broad pulse in
the GRB light curve is composed of multiple ICMART events, the overall $E_p$
evolution could be disguised as the intense-tracking pattern. Therefore, mixed
$E_p$ evolution patterns can coexist in the same burst, with a variety of
combined patterns. Our results support the ICMART model to be a competitive
model to explain the main properties of GRB prompt emission. The possible
challenges faced by the ICMART model are also discussed in details.

Title:Discovery of Stable Titanium at the Northeastern Jet of Cassiopeia A: Need for a Weak Jet Mechanism?,"
Abstract:  The origin of the jet-like structures observed in Cassiopeia A is still
unclear, although it seems to be related to its explosion mechanism. X-ray
observations of the characteristic structures could provide us useful
information on the explosive nucleosynthesis via the observation of elements,
which is a unique approach to understand its origin. We here report the
discovery of shocked stable Ti, which is produced only at the inner region of
exploding stars, in the northeast jet of Cassiopeia A using the 1-Ms deep
observation with the Chandra X-ray observatory. The observed Ti coexists with
other intermediate-mass elements (e.g. Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe at the tip of the
X-ray jet structure. We found that its elemental composition is well explained
with the production by the incomplete Si burning regime, indicating that the
formation process of the jet structure was sub-energetic at the explosion (the
peak temperature during the nuclear burning must be $\lesssim$
5$\times$10$^{9}$ K at most). Thus, we conclude that the energy source that
formed the jet structure was not the primary engine for the supernova
explosion. Our results are useful to limit the power of the jet-structure
formation process, and a weak jet mechanism with low temperature may be needed
to explain it.

Title:New evidence and analysis of cosmological-scale asymmetry in galaxy spin directions,"
Abstract:  In the past several decades, multiple cosmological theories that are based on
the contention that the Universe has a major axis have been proposed. Such
theories can be based on the geometry of the Universe, or multiverse theories
such as black hole cosmology. The contention of a cosmological-scale axis is
supported by certain evidence such as the dipole axis formed by the CMB

the distribution of the spin direction of spiral galaxies. Data from four
different telescopes is analyzed, showing nearly identical axis profiles when
the distribution of the redshifts of the galaxies is similar.

Title:Closing a spontaneous-scalarization window with binary pulsars,"
Abstract:  Benefitting from the unequaled precision of the pulsar timing technique,
binary pulsars are important testbeds of gravity theories, providing some of
the tightest bounds on alternative theories of gravity. One class of
well-motivated alternative gravity theories, the scalar-tensor gravity, predict
large deviations from general relativity for neutron stars through a
nonperturbative phenomenon known as spontaneous scalarization. This effect,
which cannot be tested in the Solar System, can now be tightly constrained
using the latest results from the timing of a set of 7 binary pulsars (PSRs
J0348+0432, J0737$-$3039A, J1012+5307, J1738+0333, J1909$-$3744, J1913+1102,
and J2222$-$0137), especially with the updated parameters of PSRs
J0737$-$3039A, J1913+1102, and J2222$-$0137. Using new timing results, we
constrain the neutron star's effective scalar coupling, which describes how
strongly neutron stars couple to the scalar field, to a level of
$\left|\alpha_{\rm A}\right| \lesssim 6 \times 10^{-3}$ in a Bayesian analysis.
Our analysis is thorough, in the sense that our results apply to all neutron
star masses and all reasonable equations of state of dense matters, in the full
relevant parameter space. It excludes the possibility of spontaneous
scalarization of neutron stars, at least within a class of scalar-tensor
gravity theories.

Title:FIESTA II. Disentangling stellar and instrumental variability from exoplanetary Doppler shifts in Fourier domain,"
Abstract:  The radial velocity (RV) detection of exoplanets is challenged by stellar
spectroscopic variability that can mimic the presence of planets and by
instrumental instability that can further obscure the detection. Both stellar
and instrumental changes can distort the spectral line profiles and be
misinterpreted as apparent RV shifts.
We present an improved FourIEr \textit{phase} SpecTrum Analysis (FIESTA
a.k.a. $\mathit{\phi}$ESTA) to disentangle apparent velocity shifts due to a
line deformation from a true Doppler shift. $\mathit{\phi}$ESTA projects
stellar spectrum's cross correlation function (CCF) onto a truncated set of
Fourier basis functions. Using the amplitude and phase information from each
Fourier mode, we can trace the line variability at different CCF width scales
to robustly identify and mitigate multiple sources of RV contamination. For
example, in our study of the 3 years of HARPS-N solar data, $\mathit{\phi}$ESTA
reveals the solar rotational effect, the long-term trend due to solar magnetic
cycle, instrumental instability and apparent solar rotation rate changes.
Applying a multiple linear regression model on $\mathit{\phi}$ESTA metrics, we
reduce the weighted rms noise from 1.89 m/s to 0.98 m/s. In addition, we
observe a $\sim$3 days lag in the $\mathit{\phi}$ESTA metrics, similar to the
findings from previous studies on BIS and FWHM.

Title:The intrinsic multiplicity distribution of exoplanets revealed from the radial velocity method,"
Abstract:  Planet multiplicities are useful in constraining the formation and evolution
of planetary systems but usually difficult to constrain observationally. Here,
we develop a general method that can properly take into account the survey
incompleteness and recover the intrinsic planet multiplicity distribution. We
then apply it to the radial velocity (RV) planet sample from the California
Legacy Survey (CLS). Within the $1\,$au ($10\,$au) region, we find $21 \pm 4\%$
($19.2 \pm 2.8\%$) of Sun-like stars host planets with masses above
$10\,M_\oplus$ ($0.3\,M_{\rm J}$), about 30\% (40\%) of which are multi-planet
systems; in terms of the RV semi-amplitude $K$, $33 \pm 7\%$ ($25 \pm 3\%$) of
Sun-like stars contain planets of $K>1\,$m/s ($3\,$m/s), and each system hosts
on average $1.8 \pm 0.4$ ($1.63 \pm 0.16$) planets. We note that the hot
Jupiter rate in the CLS Sun-like sample is higher than the consensus value of
$\sim$1\% by a factor of about three. We also confirm previous studies on the
correlation between inner ($<1\,$au) and outer ($>1\,$au) planets.

Title:Ultrahigh-energy Gamma-Ray Radiation from the Crab Pulsar Wind Nebula,"
Abstract:  It has been long debated whether the high-energy gamma-ray radiation from the
Crab nebula stems from leptonic or hadronic processes. In this work, we
investigate the multi-band non-thermal radiation from the Crab pulsar wind
nebula with the leptonic and leptonic-hadronic hybrid models, respectively.
Then we use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) sampling technology and method
of sampling trace to study the stability and reasonability of the model
parameters according to the recent observed results and obtain the best-fitting
values of parameters. Finally, we calculate different radiative components
generated by the electrons and protons in the Crab nebula. The modeling results
indicate that the pure leptonic origin model with the one-zone only can partly
agree with some segments of the data from various experiments (including the
$\rm PeV$ gamma-ray emission reported by the LHAASO and the other radiation
ranging from the radio to very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray waveband), and the
contribution of hadronic interaction is hardly constrained. However, we find
that the hadronic process may also contribute, especially in the energy range
exceeding the $\rm PeV$. In addition, it can be inferred that the higher energy
signals from the Crab nebula could be observed in the future.

Abstract:  Recent observations suggest that there are violations of the isotropy of the
universe at large scales, an important part of the cosmological principle. In
this paper, we use the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data to search for
spatial variations of the cosmological parameters in the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$
model. We fit the Planck temperature angular power spectrum
$\mathcal{C}^{TT}_\ell$ for 48 different half-skies, centering on 48 different
directions, to search for directional dependences of the standard cosmological
parameters. There are $3(2)\sigma$-level directional variations in
$\Omega_bh^2$, $\Omega_ch^2$, $n_s$, $100\theta_\mathrm{MC}$, and $H_0$ $(\tau$
and $\ln(10^{10}A_s))$. Furthermore, the directional distributions of the
parameters follow a dipole form to good approximation. The Bayes factor between
the isotropic and anisotropic hypotheses is $0.0041$, strongly disfavouring the
former. The best-fit dipole axes for $\Omega_bh^2$, $\Omega_ch^2$, $n_s$,
$100\theta_\mathrm{MC}$, and $A_s e^{-2\tau}$ all generally align with the mean
direction of $\boldsymbol{V} \equiv (b = -5.6^{+17.0{\circ}}_{-17.4}, l =
48.8^{+14.3{\circ}}_{-14.4})$, which is roughly perpendicular to the dipole of
the variation in fine structure constant, and is about $45^{\circ}$ to the
directions of the CMB kinematic dipole, CMB parity asymmetry, and polarization
of QSOs. Our results suggest either significant violation of the cosmological
principle, or previously unknown systematic errors in the standard CMB
analysis.

Title:Formation of millisecond pulsars with long orbital periods by accretion-induced collapse of white-dwarfs,"
Abstract:  Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of massive white-dwarfs (WDs) has been
proposed as an important way for the formation of neutron star (NS) systems. An
oxygen-neon (ONe) WD that accretes H-rich material from a red-giant (RG) star
may experience the AIC process, eventually producing millisecond pulsars
(MSPs), known as the RG donor channel. Previous studies indicate that this
channel can only account for MSPs with orbital periods $>500\,\rm d$. It is
worth noting that some more MSPs with wide orbits ($60-500\,\rm d$) have been
detected by recent observations, but their origin is still highly uncertain. In
the present work, by employing an adiabatic power-law assumptions for the
mass-transfer process, we performed a large number of complete binary evolution
calculations for the formation of MSPs through the RG donor channel in a
systematic way. We found that this channel can contribute to the observed MSPs
with orbital periods in the range of $50-1200\,{\rm d}$, and almost all the
observed MSPs with wide orbits can be covered by this channel in the WD
companion mass versus orbital period diagram. The present work indicates that
the AIC process provides a viable way to form MSPs with wide orbits.

Title:Self-similar Solution of Hot Accretion Flow with Thermal Conduction and Anisotropic Pressure,"
Abstract:  We explore the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction, anisotropic
pressure, and magnetic field strength on the hot accretion flows around black
holes by solving the axisymmetric, steady-state magnetohydrodynamic equations.
The anisotropic pressure is known as a mechanism for transporting angular
momentum in weakly collisional plasmas in hot accretion flows with extremely
low mass accretion rates. However, anisotropic pressure does not extensively
impact the transport of the angular momentum, it leads to shrinkage of the wind
region. Our results show that the strength of the magnetic field can help the
Poynting energy flux overcomes the kinetic energy flux. This result may be
applicable to understand the hot accretion flow in the Galactic Center Sgr A*

Title:Coronal magnetic field evolution over the cycle 24,"
Abstract:  The photospheric magnetic field vector is continuously derived from
measurements, while reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) coronal
magnetic field requires modelling with photospheric measurements as a boundary
condition. For decades the cycle variation of the magnetic field in the
photosphere has been investigated. To present, there is no study to show the
evolution of the coronal magnetic flux in the corona, nor the evolution of
solar cycle magnetic free energy. The paper aims to analyze the temporal
variation of the magnetic field and free magnetic energy in the solar corona
for the solar cycle 24 and how the magnetic field behaves in the two
hemispheres. We investigate if we can obtain better estimates of the magnetic
field at Earth using the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation
method. To model the magnetic field over cycle 24 we apply the NLFFF
optimization method to the synoptic vector magnetic maps derived from the
observations of Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamic
Observatory (SDO). We found that during the solar cycle 24, the maximum of the
Sun's dynamics is different from the sunspot number (SSN) maximum peak. The
major contribution to the total unsigned flux is provided by the flux coming
from the magnetic field structures other than sunspots (MSOS) within latitudes
between -30 and +30 degrees. The magnetic flux variation during the solar cycle
24 shows a different evolution in the corona than in the photosphere. We found
a correlation value of 0.8 between the derived magnetic energy from our model
and the flare energy index derived from observations. On average, cycle 24 had
a higher number of sunspots in the northern hemisphere (NH) but stronger flux
in the southern hemisphere (SH) which could more effectively reach the higher
layers of the atmosphere. The coupling between the hemispheres increases with
height.

Abstract:  The dominant radio emission mechanism in radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) is an
open question. Primary contenders include: low-power radio jets, winds,
star-formation and coronal emission. Our work suggests that radio polarization
and emission-line studies can help to distinguish between these scenarios and
determine the primary contributor. Our multi-frequency, multi-scale radio
polarization study has revealed a composite jet and ""wind"" radio outflow in the
radio-intermediate quasar, III Zw 2, as well as in the BALQSO, Mrk 231. Our
radio polarization study in conjunction with the [O III] emission-line study of
five type 2 RQQs have provided insights on the interplay of jets/winds and
emission-line gas. These sources reveal an anti-correlation between polarized
radio emission and [O III] emission. This is similar to that observed in some
radio-loud AGN in the literature and suggests that the radio emission could be
depolarized by the emission-line gas. Overall, our work suggests that a close
interaction between the radio outflow and the surrounding gaseous environment
is likely to be responsible for their stunted form in RQ and RI AGN.

Abstract:  We study the CO(1-0)-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($X_{\rm CO}$) and the line
ratio of CO(2-1)-to-CO(1-0) ($R_{21}$) across a wide range of metallicity ($0.1
\leq Z/Z_\odot \leq 3$) in high-resolution (~0.2 pc) hydrodynamical simulations
of a self-regulated multiphase interstellar medium. We construct synthetic CO
emission maps via radiative transfer and systematically vary the
""observational"" beam size to quantify the scale dependence. We find that the
kpc-scale $X_{\rm CO}$ can be over-estimated at low $Z$ if assuming
steady-state chemistry or assuming that the star-forming gas is
H$_2$-dominated. On parsec scales, $X_{\rm CO}$ varies by orders of magnitude
from place to place, primarily driven by the transition from atomic carbon to
CO. The pc-scale $X_{\rm CO}$ drops to the Milky Way value of $2\times 10^{20}\
{\rm cm^{-2}~(K~km~s^{-1})^{-1}}$ once dust shielding becomes effective,
independent of $Z$. The CO lines become increasingly optically thin at lower
$Z$, leading to a higher $R_{21}$. Most cloud area is filled by diffuse gas
with high $X_{\rm CO}$ and low $R_{21}$, while most CO emission originates from
dense gas with low $X_{\rm CO}$ and high $R_{21}$. Adopting a constant $X_{\rm
CO}$ strongly over- (under-)estimates H$_2$ in dense (diffuse) gas. The line
intensity negatively (positively) correlates with $X_{\rm CO}$ ($R_{21}$) as it
is a proxy of column density (volume density). On large scales, $X_{\rm CO}$
and $R_{21}$ are dictated by beam averaging, and they are naturally biased
towards values in dense gas. Our predicted $X_{\rm CO}$ is a multivariate
function of $Z$, line intensity, and beam size, which can be used to more
accurately infer the H$_2$ mass.

supernova 2020znr during 3 phases after maximum light (approximately +34 days,

correction, all measurements are consistent with null-polarization detection.
Modelling the light curve with a magnetar spin-down model shows that SN 2020znr

best-fit values discussed in the literature on SN 2017egm and SN 2015bn, two

geometry of the inner ejecta with optical polarimetry. The combined information
provided by spectroscopy and light curve analysis of type I SLSNe may be an
interesting avenue to categorize the polarization properties of this class of

Abstract:  Context: Stellar occultations, greatly enhanced by the publication of the
Gaia data releases, permit not only the determination of asteroid size and
shape, but also the retrieval of additional, accurate astrometry, with a
possible relevant impact on the study of dynamical properties. The use of Gaia
as reference catalogue and the recent implementation of an improved error model
for occultation astrometry offer the opportunity to test its global astrometric
performance on the existing data set of observed events, dominated by minor
planets belonging to the main belt.
Aims: We aim to explore the performance on orbit accuracy brought by reducing
occultations by stellar positions given in Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) and Early
Data Release 3 (EDR3), exploited jointly with the new occultation error model.
Our goal is to verify that the quality of DR2 and EDR3 provides a logical
progression in the exploitation of occultation astrometry with respect to
previous catalogues. We also want to compare the post-fit residuals to the
error model.
Methods: We began with accurate orbit adjustment to occultation data, either
alone or joined to the other available ground-based observations. We then
analyzed the orbit accuracy and the post-fit residuals.
Results: Gaia EDR3 and DR2 bring a noticeable improvement to the accuracy of
occultation data, bringing an average reduction of their residuals upon fitting
an orbit of about a factor of 5 when compared to other catalogues. This is
particularly visible when occultations alone are used, resulting in very good
orbits for a large fraction of objects. We demonstrate that occultation
astrometry can reach the performance of Gaia on small asteroids. The joint use
of archival data and occultations remains more challenging due to the higher
uncertainties and systematic errors of other data, mainly obtained by
traditional CCD imaging.

with photometric rotation periods from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS). The stars used in this work are selected from the superblink

detection in the first eROSITA survey (eRASS1) and a rotation period
measurement from TESS jointly with the sample of 197 superblink M dwarfs
re-adapted from our previous work. We fit the activity-rotation relation for
stars with rotation periods shorter than ~10 d (saturated regime) using three
mass bins. The surprising positive slope for stars in our lowest mass bin
($M_{\star} \leq 0.4 {\rm M_\odot}$) is due to a paucity of stars with
intermediate rotation periods (~ 1-10 d), probably caused by fast period
evolution. The much higher fraction of eRASS1 detections compared to stars that
have also rotation periods from TESS shows that eROSITA is also sensitive for
slower rotating M dwarfs that are in the unsaturated regime with periods
inaccessible to TESS.

conservation leads to the formation of cold HI disks; these disks further
evolve under the action of star formation induced by disk instabilities, of the
associated mass discharge onto the central SMBH, and of the consequent AGN
feedback. At the end of the simulations, the hot (metal enriched) gas mass is
roughly $10\%$ the mass in the old stars, with twice as much having been
ejected into the intergalactic medium. The cold gas disks are a $\approx$ kpc
in size, and the metal rich new stars are in $0.1$ kpc disks. The masses of
cold gas and new stars are roughly $0.1\%$ the mass of the old stars. Overall,
the final systems appear to reproduce quite successfully the main global
properties of real ETGs.

Title:Long-period Ap stars discovered with TESS data: The northern ecliptic hemisphere,"
Abstract:  The rotation periods of the magnetic Ap stars span five to six orders of
magnitude. Period differentiation must have taken place at the pre-main
sequence stage, but the physical processes that lead to it remain elusive. The
study of Ap stars that have rotation periods of tens to hundreds of years
represents a promising avenue to gain additional insight into the origin and
evolution of rotation in Ap stars.
Historically, almost all the longest period Ap stars known have been found to
be strongly magnetic; very few weakly magnetic Ap stars with very long periods
have been identified and studied. We performed a systematic search based on
TESS data to identify super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars independently of
the strengths of their magnetic fields, with the intention to characterise the
distribution of the longest Ap star rotation periods in an unbiased manner. We
find 67 Ap stars with no rotational variability in the northern ecliptic
hemisphere TESS data. Among them, 46 are newly identified ssrAp star
candidates, which is double the number previously found in the southern
ecliptic hemisphere.
We confirm that super-slow rotation tends to occur less frequently in weakly
magnetic Ap stars than in strongly magnetic stars. We present new evidence of
the existence of a gap between ~2 kG and ~3 kG in the distribution of the
magnetic field strengths of long period Ap stars. We also confirm that the
incidence of roAp stars is higher than average in slowly rotating Ap stars. We
report the unexpected discovery of nine definite and five candidate {\delta}
Sct stars, and of two eclipsing binaries. This work paves the way for a
systematic, unbiased study of the longest period Ap stars, with a view to
characterise the correlations between their rotational, magnetic, and
pulsational properties.

Title:The International Pulsar Timing Array second data release: Search for an isotropic Gravitational Wave Background,"
Abstract:  We searched for an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background in the
second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array, a global
collaboration synthesizing decadal-length pulsar-timing campaigns in North
America, Europe, and Australia. In our reference search for a power law strain
spectrum of the form $h_c = A(f/1\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1})^{\alpha}$, we found strong
evidence for a spectrally-similar low-frequency stochastic process of amplitude
$A = 3.8^{+6.3}_{-2.5}\times10^{-15}$ and spectral index $\alpha = -0.5 \pm
0.5$, where the uncertainties represent 95\% credible regions, using
information from the auto- and cross-correlation terms between the pulsars in
the array. For a spectral index of $\alpha = -2/3$, as expected from a
population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries, the recovered
amplitude is $A = 2.8^{+1.2}_{-0.8}\times10^{-15}$. Nonetheless, no significant
evidence of the Hellings-Downs correlations that would indicate a
gravitational-wave origin was found. We also analyzed the constituent data from
the individual pulsar timing arrays in a consistent way, and clearly
demonstrate that the combined international data set is more sensitive.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this combined data set produces comparable
constraints to recent single-array data sets which have more data than the
constituent parts of the combination. Future international data releases will
deliver increased sensitivity to gravitational wave radiation, and
significantly increase the detection probability.

Title:Galactic gamma-ray and neutrino emission from interacting cosmic-ray nuclei,"
Abstract:  We present a study of the expectations for very-high-energy (VHE) to
ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray and neutrino emission from interacting cosmic
rays in our Galaxy as well as a comparison to the latest results for the
Galactic UHE diffuse emission. We demonstrate the importance of properly
accounting for both the mixed cosmic-ray composition and the gamma-ray
absorption. We adopt the wounded-nucleon model of nucleus interactions and
provide parameterisations of the resulting gamma-ray and neutrino production.
Nucleon shielding due to clustering inside nuclei is shown to have a measurable
effect on the production of gamma rays and is particularly evident close to
breaks and cutoffs in mixed-composition particle spectra. The change in
composition around the `knee' in the cosmic ray spectrum has a noticeable
impact on the diffuse neutrino and gamma-ray emission spectra. We show that
current and near-future detectors can probe these differences in the key energy
range from 10 TeV to 1 PeV, testing the paradigm of the universality of the
cosmic ray spectrum and composition throughout the Galaxy.

Title:Non-resonant relaxation of anisotropic globular clusters,"
Abstract:  Globular clusters are dense stellar systems whose core slowly contracts under
the effect of self-gravity. The rate of this process was recently found to be
directly linked to the initial amount of velocity anisotropy: tangentially
anisotropic clusters contract faster than radially anisotropic ones.
Furthermore, initially anisotropic clusters are found to generically tend
towards more isotropic distributions during the onset of contraction.
Chandrasekhar's ""non-resonant"" (NR) theory of diffusion describes this
relaxation as being driven by a sequence of local two-body deflections along
each star's orbit. We explicitly tailor this NR prediction to anisotropic
clusters, and compare it with $N$-body realisations of Plummer spheres with
varying degrees of anisotropy. The NR theory is shown to recover remarkably
well the detailed shape of the orbital diffusion and the associated initial
isotropisation, up to a global multiplicative prefactor which increases with
anisotropy. Strikingly, a simple effective isotropic prescription provides
almost as good a fit, as long as the cluster's anisotropy is not too strong.
For these more extreme clusters, accounting for long-range resonant relaxation
may be necessary to capture these clusters' long-term evolution.

Title:Modelling of propagation of very-high-energy gamma rays with CRbeam code. Comparison with CRPropa and ELMAG codes,"
Abstract:  Very-high-energy gamma rays produce electron positron pairs in interactions
with low-energy photons of extragalactic background light during propagation
through the intergalactic medium. The electron-positron pairs generate
secondary gamma rays detectable by gamma-ray telescopes. This secondary
emission can be used to detect Inter-Galactic Magnetic Fields (IGMF) in the
voids of Large Scale Structure. New gamma-ray observatory, Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA), will provide an increase of sensitivity for detection of these
secondary gamma-ray emission and enable measurement of its properties for
sources at cosmological distances. Interpretation of the CTA data including
detection of IGMF and study of it's properties and origin will require
precision modelling of the primary and secondary gamma-ray fluxes. We asses the
precision of the modelling of the secondary gamma-ray emission using model
calculations with publicly available Monte-Carlo codes CRPropa and ELMAG and
compare their predictions with theoretical expectations and with model
calculations of a newly developed CRbeam code. We find that model predictions
of different codes differ by up to 50% for low-redshift sources, with
discrepancies increasing up to order-of-magnitude level with the increasing
source redshifts. We identify the origin of these discrepancies and argue that
the new CRbeam code provides reliable predictions for spectral, timing and
imaging properties of the secondary gamma-ray signal and can be used to study
gamma-ray sources and IGMF with precision relevant for the prospective CTA
study of the effects of gamma-ray propagation through the intergalactic medium.

Title:V4334 Sgr (Sakurai's Object): still churning out the dust,"
Abstract:  We present a $0.8-2.5\,\mu$m spectrum of the Very Late Thermal Pulse object
V4334 Sgr (Sakurai's Object), obtained in 2020 September. The spectrum displays
a continuum that rises strongly to longer wavelengths, and is considerably
brighter than the most recent published spectrum obtained seven years earlier.
At the longer wavelengths the continuum is well fitted by a blackbody with a
temperature of $624\pm8$ K. However, there is excess continuum at the shortest
wavelengths that we interpret as being due to hot dust that has very recently
formed in an environment with C/O $\simeq2.5$. Other possible sources for this
excess continuum are discussed - such as the stellar photosphere dimly seen
through the dust shell, and light scattered off the inner wall of the dust
torus - but these interpretations seem unlikely. Numerous emission lines are
present, including those of HeI, CI, [CI], and OI. Our observations confirm
that emission in the HeI 1.083$\,\mu$m and [CI] 0.9827/0.9852$\,\mu$m lines is
spatially extended. The [CI] line fluxes suggest that the electron density
increased by an order of magnitude between 2013 and 2020, and that these two
lines may soon disappear from the spectrum. The flux ratio of the 1.083$\,\mu$m
and 2.058$\,\mu$m HeI lines is consistent with the previously-assumed
interstellar extinction. The stellar photosphere remains elusive, and the
central star may not be as hot as suggested by current evolutionary models.

Title:A comprehensive photometric and kinematical characteristic of the newly discovered QCs clusters with Gaia EDR3,"
Abstract:  This study reports the first comprehensive astrometric, photometric and
kinematical analysis of four newly discovered open clusters; namely QC1, QC2,
QC3, and QC4, using astrometric and photometric data from the most recent Gaia
EDR3 for G<17 mag. Utilizing the ASteCA code, we identified the most probable
(P>=50%) star candidates and found the numbers of star members (N) to be 118
(QC1), 142(QC2), 210 (QC3), and 110 (QC4). By fitting King's density profile to
the cluster's RDPs, we found the internal structural parameters of each cluster
such as the cluster radii that are in the range 7.00 to 11.00arcmin. For each
cluster we constructed the CMD and by fitting them with suitable isochrones we
found that the metallicity range is (0.0152-0.0199) which is in line with the
Solar value, the logarithmic age (in yrs) range between 6.987 and 8.858. The
distances derived from CMD are 1674+/-41, 1927+/-44, 1889+/-43,and 1611+/-40
(pc) for QC1, QC2, QC3, and QC4, respectively, and they are in good agreement
up to 85% with the values obtained from the astrometric data. In addition, from
the MLR of the clusters, we obtained a total mass, M_C in Solar units, of 158,
177, 232, and 182 and an absolute magnitude MG(mag)of 4.33, 3.80, 4.25, and
4.10 for QC1, QC2, QC3, and QC4, respectively. The dynamical analysis and
evolution parameters of the cluster members indicated that all the four
clusters are dynamically relaxed;except QC1 which has an evolution parameter
tau=0.82 that indicates a dynamical activity within the cluster. From the

coordinates of the apex point (A,D) using the AD-diagram method, as well as the

"Title:Relative abundance constraints from high-resolution optical transmission spectroscopy of WASP-121b, and a fast model-filtering technique for accelerating retrievals","
Abstract:  High-resolution Doppler-resolved spectroscopy has presented new opportunities
for studying the atmospheres of exoplanets. While the 'classical'
cross-correlation approach has proven to be efficient at finding atmospheric
species, it is unable to perform direct atmospheric retrievals. Recent work has
shown that retrievals are possible using a direct likelihood evaluation or
likelihood 'mappings'. The unique aspect of high-resolution retrievals is that
the data-processing methods required to remove the stellar and telluric lines
also distort the underlying exoplanet's signal and therefore the forward model
must be pre-processed to match this filtering. This was the key remaining
limitation in our previously published framework. This paper directly addresses
this by introducing a simple and fast model-filtering technique that can
replicate the processing performed by algorithms such as SysRem and PCA. This
enables retrievals to be performed without having to perform expensive
injection and pre-processing steps for every model. We show that we can
reliably constrain quantitative measures of the atmosphere from transmission
spectra including the temperature-pressure profile, relative abundances,
planetary velocities and rotational broadening parameters. Finally, we
demonstrate our framework using UVES transmission spectroscopy of WASP-121b. We
constrain the temperature-pressure profile and relative abundances of Fe, Cr,
and V to be $\log_{10}(\chi_{\rm Fe}/\chi_{\rm Cr})$=1.66$\pm$0.28,
$\log_{10}(\chi_{\rm Fe}/\chi_{\rm V})$=3.78$\pm$0.29 and $\log_{10}(\chi_{\rm
Fe}/\chi_{\rm Mg})$=-1.26$\pm$0.60. The relative abundances are consistent with
solar values, with the exception of Fe/Mg, where the large Mg abundance is
probably explained by the escaping atmosphere of WASP-121b that is not
accounted for in our atmospheric model.

Title:Axion-photon multimessenger astronomy with giant flares,"
Abstract:  We treat prospects for multimessenger astronomy with giant flares (GFs), a
rare transient event featured by magnetars that can be as luminous as a hundred
of the brightest supernovae ever observed. The beamed photons could correlate
with an axion counterpart via resonant conversion in the magnetosphere. In a
realistic parameter space, we find that the sensitivity limit to galactic GFs
for currently viable experiments is $\mathrm{g}_{\phi
\gamma}\!\gtrsim\!\mathrm{several}\!\times\!10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ \&
$\mathrm{g}_{\phi e}\!\gtrsim\!\mathrm{few}\!\times\!10^{-12}$. We rule out the
compatibility of axion flares with the recent XENON1T excess only due to the
time persistence of the signal.

multiple X-ray missions since last century. With the abundance of long-term
observations, we present a complete set of orbital light-curves of Her X-1/HZ
Her during the six states of the 35-day cycle in multiple energy bands. These
illustrate in detail the changing light-curve caused by the rotating
twisted-tilted accretion disc surrounding the neutron star. The orbital
light-curves during Main-High (MH) state are analyzed in 0.05 35-day phase
intervals. These show the regular occurrence of pre-eclipse dips which march to
earlier orbital phase as 35-day phase increase. From the multi-band
light-curves we derive time-average orbital phase dependence of column density
for photoelectric absorption and energy-independent transmission as a function
of 35-day phase. The X-ray light-curves during Low States are similar in shape
to the optical Low State light-curve, but X-ray leads optical by $\simeq$0.04
to 0.08 in orbital phase.

Title:The protoplanetary disk population in the rho-Ophiuchi region L1688 and the time evolution of Class II YSOs,"
Abstract:  (Abridged) We present a study of the disk population in L1688, the densest
and youngest region in Ophiuchus, and we compare it with other nearby regions
of different age, namely Lupus, Chamaeleon I, Corona Australis, Taurus and
Upper Scorpius. We select our L1688 sample using a combination of criteria
(ALMA data, Gaia, optical/near-IR spectroscopy) and determine stellar and disk
properties, specifically stellar mass (Mstar), average population age, mass
accretion rate (Macc) and disk dust mass (Mdust). a) In L1688 the relations
between Macc and Mstar, Mdust and Mstar, and Macc and Mdust have a roughly
linear trend with slopes 1.8-1.9 for the first two relations and ~1 for the
third, similarly to what found in the other regions. b) When ordered according
to the characteristic age of each region, Macc decreases as 1/t, when corrected
for the different stellar mass content; Mdust follows roughly the same trend
between 0.5 and 5 Myr, but has an increase of a factor ~3 at ages of 2-3 Myr.
We suggest that this could result from an earlier planet formation, followed by
collisional fragmentation that temporarily replenishes the millimeter-size
grain population. c) The dispersion of Macc and Mdust around the best-fitting
relation with Mstar, as well as that of Macc versus Mdust are large: we find
that the dispersions have continuous distributions with a log-normal shape and
similar width (~0.8 dex). The amount of dust observed at ~1 Myr does not appear
to be sufficient to assemble the majority of planetary systems, which suggests
an earlier planetary cores formation. The dust mass traces to a large extent
the disk gas mass evolution. Two properties remain puzzling: the steep
dependence of Macc and Mdust on Mstar and the cause of the large dispersion in
the three relations analyzed in this paper, in particular the one of the Macc
versus Mdust relation.

"Title:Discovery of Extreme, Roughly-Daily Superflares on the Recurrent Nova V2487 Oph","
Abstract:  V2487 Oph is a recurrent nova with detected eruptions in 1900 and 1998.
Startlingly, V2487 Oph shows flares, called `Superflares', with up to 1.10 mag
amplitude, fast rises of under one-minute, always with an initial impulsive
spike followed by a roughly-exponential tail, typically one-hour durations, and
with random event times averaging once-per-day. The typical flare energy $E$ is
over 10$^{38}$ ergs, while the yearly energy budget is 10$^{41}$ ergs. V2487
Oph Superflares obey three relations; the number distribution of flare energies
scales as $E^{-2.34\pm0.35}$, the waiting time from one flare to the next is
proportional to $E$ of the first event, and flare durations scale as
$E^{0.44\pm0.03}$. Scenarios involving gravitational energy and nuclear energy
fail to satisfy the three relations. The magnetic energy scenario, however, can
explain all three relations. This scenario has magnetic field lines above the
disc being twisted and amplified by the motions of their footprints, with
magnetic reconnection releasing energy that comes out as Superflare light. This
exact mechanism is already well known to occur in white light solar flares, in
ordinary M-type flare stars, and in the many Superflare stars observed all
across the H-R diagram. Superflares on Superflare stars have rise times, light
curve shapes and durations that are very similar to those on V2487 Oph. So we
conclude that the V2487 Oph Superflares are caused by large-scale magnetic
reconnection. V2487 Oph is now the most extreme Superflare star, exhibiting the
largest known flare energy (1.6$\times$10$^{39}$ ergs) and the fastest
occurrence rate.

Title:Tracing pebble drift and trapping using radial carbon depletion profiles in protoplanetary disks,"
Abstract:  The composition of planets may be largely determined by the chemical
processing and accretion of icy pebbles in protoplanetary disks. Recent
observations of protoplanetary disks hint at wide-spread depletion of gaseous
carbon. The missing volatile carbon is likely frozen in CO and/or CO$_2$ ice on
grains and locked into the disk through pebble trapping in pressure bumps or
planetesimals. We present the results of the first successful ACA (Atacama
Compact Array) [C I] $J$ = 1-0 mini-survey of seven protoplanetary disks. Using
tailored azimuthally symmetric DALI (Dust And LInes) thermo-chemical disk
models, supported by the [C I] $J$ = 1-0 and resolved CO isotopologue data, we
determine the system-averaged elemental volatile carbon abundance in the outer
disk of three sources. Six out of seven sources are detected in [C I] $J$ = 1-0
with ACA, four of which show a distinct disk component. Based on the modeling
we find severe cold gaseous carbon depletion in the outer disk of DL Tau and
moderate depletion in the outer disks of DR Tau and DO Tau. Combining the outer
and inner disk carbon abundances, we demonstrate definitive evidence for radial
drift in the disk of DL Tau, where the existence of multiple dust rings points
to either short lived or leaky dust traps. We find dust locking in the compact
and smooth disks of DO Tau and DR Tau, hinting at unresolved dust substructure.
Comparing our results with stars of different ages and luminosities, we
identify an observational evolutionary trend in gaseous carbon depletion that
is consistent with dynamical models of CO depletion processes. Transport
efficiency of solids in protoplanetary disks can significantly differ from what
we expect based on the current resolved substructure in the continuum
observations. This has important implications for our understanding of the
impact of radial drift and pebble accretion on planetary compositions.

Title:First images of the molecular gas around a born-again star revealed by ALMA,"
Abstract:  Born-again stars allow probing stellar evolution in human timescales and
provide the most promising path for the formation of hydrogen-deficient
post-asymptotic giant branch objects, but their cold and molecular components
remain poorly explored. Here we present ALMA observations of V605 Aql that
unveil for the first time the spatio-kinematic distribution of the molecular
material associated to a born-again star. Both the continuum and molecular line
emission exhibit a clumpy ring-like structure with a total extent of
$\approx$1$^{\prime\prime}$ in diameter. The bulk of the molecular emission is
interpreted as being produced in a radially-expanding disk-like structure with
an expansion velocity v$_{\rm exp}$$\sim$90 km s$^{-1}$ and an inclination
$i$$\approx$60$^{\circ}$ with respect to the line-of-sight. The observations
also reveal a compact high-velocity component, v$_{\rm exp}$$\sim$280 km
s$^{-1}$, that is aligned perpendicularly to the expanding disk. This component
is interpreted as a bipolar outflow with a kinematical age $\tau$$\lesssim$20
yr, which could either be material that is currently being ejected from V605
Aql, or it is being dragged from the inner parts of the disk by a stellar wind.
The dust mass of the disk is in the range $M_{\rm
dust}$$\sim$0.2-8$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$, depending on the dust
absorption coefficient. The mass of the CO is $M_{\rm
CO}$$\approx$1.1$\times10^{-5}$ $M_{\odot}$, which is more than three orders of
magnitude larger than the mass of the other detected molecules. We estimate a
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of 5.6$\pm$0.6, which is consistent with the single
stellar evolution scenario in which the star experienced a very late thermal
pulse instead of a nova-like event as previously suggested.

Abstract:  In this work, predictions of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of dark energy (GLT)

dark energy fluctuations in this semi-phenomenological model is favored by data
in several ways. Firstly, unlike $\Lambda$CDM, $\ell\leq801$ and $\ell>801$
ranges of the CMB angular power spectrum are consistent in this framework.
Secondly, the lensing amplitude $A_L$ is completely consistent with unity when
GLT is confronted with CMB data, even without including CMB lensing data.
Therefore lensing anomaly is absent in this model. Furthermore, the background
evolution of dark energy in this model is able to reconcile the $H_0$ inferred
from CMB with that of directly measured through observing nearby standard
candles.

Abstract:  We derive an estimator for the lensing potential from galaxy number counts
which contains a linear and a quadratic term. We show that this estimator has a
much larger signal-to-noise ratio than the corresponding estimator from
intensity mapping. We show that this is due to the additional lensing term in
the number count angular power spectrum which is present already at linear
order. We estimate the signal-to-noise ratio for future photometric surveys. We
find that particularly at high redshifts, $z\gtrsim 1.5$, the signal to noise
ratio can become of order 30. We therefore claim that number counts in
photometric surveys are an excellent means to measure tomographic lensing
spectra.

Title:Migration and Mixing in the Galactic Disc from Encounters between Sagittarius and the Milky Way,"
Abstract:  Stars born on near-circular orbits in spiral galaxies can subsequently
migrate to different orbits due to interactions with non-axisymmetric
disturbances within the disc such as bars or spiral arms. This paper extends
the study of migration to examine the role of external influences using the
example of the interaction of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) with the Milky
Way (MW). We first make impulse approximation estimates to characterize the
influence of Sgr disc passages. The tidal forcing from Sgr can produce changes
in both guiding radius ($\Delta R_g$) and orbital eccentricity, as quantified
by the maximum radial excursion, $\Delta R_ {\rm max} $. These changes follow a
quadrupole-like pattern across the face of the disc, with amplitude increasing
with Galactocentric radius. We next examine a collisionless N-body simulation
of a Sgr-like satellite interacting with a MW-like galaxy and find that Sgr's
influence in the outer disc dominates over the secular evolution of orbits
between disc passages. Finally, we use the same simulation to explore possible
observable signatures of Sgr-induced migration by painting the simulation with
different age stellar populations. We find that following Sgr disc passages,
the migration it induces manifests within an annulus as an approximate
quadrupole in azimuthal metallicity variations ($\delta_ {\rm [Fe/H]} $), along
with systematic variations in orbital eccentricity, $\Delta R_ {\rm max} $.
These systematic variations can persist for several rotational periods. We
conclude that this combination of signatures may be used to distinguish between
the different migration mechanisms shaping the chemical abundance patterns of
the Milky Way's thin disc.

Abstract:  We present orbital elements, orbital parallaxes and individual component

derived doing a simultaneous fit of their visual orbit and radial velocity
curve. This was done by means of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code developed by
our group, which produces posterior distribution functions and error estimates
for all the parameters. Of this sample, six systems had high quality previous
studies and were included as benchmarks to test our procedures, but even in
these cases we could improve the previous orbits by adding recent data from our
survey of southern binaries being carried out with the HRCam and ZORRO speckle
cameras at the SOAR 4.1m and Gemini South 8.1m telescopes, respectively. We
also give results for eight objects that did not have a published combined
orbital solution, one of which did not have a visual orbit either. We could
determine mass ratios with a typical uncertainty of less than 1%, mass sums
with uncertainties of about 1% and individual component masses with a formal
uncertainty of $0.01 M_\odot$ in the best cases. A comparison of our orbital
parallaxes with available trigonometric parallaxes from Hipparcos and Gaia
eDR3, shows a good correspondence; the mean value of the differences being
consistent with zero within the errors of both catalogs. We also present
observational HR diagrams for our sample of binaries, which in combination with
isochrones from different sources allowed us to asses their evolutionary status

Title:Fundamental differences in the properties of red and blue quasars: measuring the reddening and accretion properties with X-shooter,"
Abstract:  We have recently found fundamental differences in the radio properties of red
quasars when compared to typical blue quasars. In this paper we use X-shooter
data, providing spectral coverage from $\sim 3000-25000$ Ang, of a sample of 40
red and blue luminous quasars at $1.45<z<1.65$ to explore the connections
between the radio, emission-line, and accretion-disc properties. We fit various
dust-extinction curves to the data and find that dust reddening can fully
explain the observed colours for the majority of the red quasars in our sample,
with moderate extinctions ranging from Av$\sim 0.06-0.7$ mags. We confront our
spectra with a simple thin accretion-disc model and find this can describe the
continua of both the blue and red quasars, once corrected for dust extinction;
we also find no significant differences in the accretion properties. We detect
ionized outflows in a number of red and blue quasars, but do not find any
significant evidence that they are more prevalent in the red quasar population.
Overall our findings imply that the radio emission is more closely connected to
circumnuclear/ISM opacity rather than accretion disc or outflow differences.

Title:TESS Giants Transiting Giants II: The hottest Jupiters orbiting evolved stars,"
Abstract:  Giant planets on short-period orbits are predicted to be inflated and
eventually engulfed by their host stars. However, the detailed timescales and
stages of these processes are not well known. Here we present the discovery of
three hot Jupiters (P $<$ 10 d) orbiting evolved, intermediate-mass stars
($M_\star$ $\approx$ 1.5 M$_\odot$, 2 R$_\odot$ $<$ $R_\star < $ 5 R$_\odot$).
By combining \tess photometry with ground-based photometry and radial velocity
measurements, we report masses and radii for these three planets between 0.4
and 1.8 M$_\mathrm{J}$ and 0.8 and 1.8 R$_\mathrm{J}$. \planet has the shortest
period (P=\period) of any planet discovered around a red giant star to date.
Both \planettwo and \planetthree appear to be inflated, but \planet does not
show any sign of inflation. The large radii and relatively low masses of
\planettwo and \planetthree place them among the lowest density hot Jupiters
currently known, while \planet is conversely one of the highest. All three
planets have orbital eccentricities below 0.2. The large spread in radii for
these systems implies that planet inflation has a complex dependence on planet
mass, radius, incident flux, and orbital properties. We predict that \planet
has the shortest orbital decay timescale of any planet currently known, but do
not detect any orbital decay in this system. Transmission spectroscopy of
\planettwo would provide a favorable opportunity for the detection of water,
carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide features in the atmosphere of a planet
orbiting an evolved star, and could yield new information about planet
formation and atmospheric evolution.

Title:Stellar winds and photoionization in a spiral arm,"
Abstract:  The role of different stellar feedback mechanisms in giant molecular clouds
is not well understood. This is especially true for regions with many
interacting clouds as would be found in a galactic spiral arm. In this paper,
building on previous work by Bending et al., we extract a
$500\times500\times100$ pc section of a spiral arm from a galaxy simulation. We
use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to re-simulate the region at higher
resolution (1 M$_\odot$ per particle). We present a method for momentum-driven
stellar winds from main sequence massive stars, and include this with
photoionization, self-gravity, a galactic potential, and ISM heating/cooling.
We also include cluster-sink particles with accretion radii of 0.78 pc to track
star/cluster formation. The feedback methods are as robust as previous models
on individual cloud scales (e.g. Dale et al.). We find that photoionization
dominates the disruption of the spiral arm section, with stellar winds only
producing small cavities (at most $\sim$ 30 pc). Stellar winds do not affect
the resulting cloud statistics or the integrated star formation
rate/efficiency, unlike ionization, which produces more stars, and more clouds
of higher density and higher velocity dispersion compared to the control run
without feedback. Winds do affect the sink properties, distributing star
formation over more low-mass sinks ($\sim 10^2$ M$_\odot$) and producing fewer
high-mass sinks ($\sim 10^3$ M$_\odot$). Overall, stellar winds play at best a
secondary role compared to photoionization, and on many measures, they have a
negligible impact.

Title:Breaking baryon-cosmology degeneracy with the electron density power spectrum,"
Abstract:  Uncertain feedback processes in galaxies affect the distribution of matter,
currently limiting the power of weak lensing surveys. If we can identify
cosmological statistics that are robust against these uncertainties, or
constrain these effects by other means, then we can enhance the power of
current and upcoming observations from weak lensing surveys such as DES,
Euclid, the Rubin Observatory, and the Roman Space Telescope. In this work, we
investigate the potential of the electron density auto-power spectrum as a
robust probe of cosmology and baryonic feedback. We use a suite of
(magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS project and perform an
idealized analysis to forecast statistical uncertainties on a limited set of
cosmological and physically-motivated astrophysical parameters. We find that
the electron number density auto-correlation, measurable through either
kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations or through Fast Radio Burst
dispersion measures, provides tight constraints on $\Omega_{m}$ and the mean
baryon fraction in intermediate-mass halos, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{bar}}$. By
obtaining an empirical measure for the associated systematic uncertainties, we
find these constraints to be largely robust to differences in baryonic feedback
models implemented in hydrodynamic simulations. We further discuss the main
caveats associated with our analysis, and point out possible directions for
future work.

Title:The Linear Regime of Tachyonic Preheating,"
Abstract:  Tachyonic preheating is realized when the inflaton repeatedly returns to a
convex region of the potential during the post-inflationary oscillating phase.
This will induce a strong tachyonic instability and lead to a rapid
fragmentation of the coherent field that can complete within a fraction of an
$e$-fold. In this paper, we study the linear regime of this process in a
model-independent way. To this purpose, we construct simplified models that
provide an analytic Floquet theoretic description of mode growth. This approach
captures the essential features of well-motivated tachyonic preheating
scenarios, including scenarios in which the inflaton is part of a larger scalar
multiplet. We show that tachyonic preheating is efficient if the field
excursions are sub-Planckian, can produce gravitational waves in the frequency
range of current and future gravitational wave interferometers, and can be
consistent with any experimentally allowed tensor-to-scalar ratio.

Title:The TESS-Keck Survey. VIII. Confirmation of a Transiting Giant Planet on an Eccentric 261 day Orbit with the Automated Planet Finder Telescope,"
Abstract:  We report the discovery of TOI-2180 b, a 2.8 $M_{\rm J}$ giant planet
orbiting a slightly evolved G5 host star. This planet transited only once in
Cycle 2 of the primary Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission.
Citizen scientists identified the 24 hr single-transit event shortly after the
data were released, allowing a Doppler monitoring campaign with the Automated
Planet Finder telescope at Lick Observatory to begin promptly. The radial
velocity observations refined the orbital period of TOI-2180 b to be
260.8$\pm$0.6 days, revealed an orbital eccentricity of 0.368$\pm$0.007, and
discovered long-term acceleration from a more distant massive companion. We
conducted ground-based photometry from 14 sites spread around the globe in an
attempt to detect another transit. Although we did not make a clear transit
detection, the nondetections improved the precision of the orbital period. We
predict that TESS will likely detect another transit of TOI-2180 b in Sector 48
of its extended mission. We use giant planet structure models to retrieve the
bulk heavy-element content of TOI-2180 b. When considered alongside other giant
planets with orbital periods over 100 days, we find tentative evidence that the
correlation between planet mass and metal enrichment relative to stellar is
dependent on orbital properties. Single-transit discoveries like TOI-2180 b
highlight the exciting potential of the TESS mission to find planets with long
orbital periods and low irradiation fluxes despite the selection biases
associated with the transit method.

Title:The Origin of Exponential Star-forming Disks,"
Abstract:  The disk components of galaxies generally show an exponential profile
extending over several scale lengths, both in mass and star-formation rate, but
the physical origin is not well understood. We explore a physical model in
which the galactic gas disk is viewed as a ""modified accretion disk"" in which
coplanar gas inflow, driven by viscous stresses in the disk, provides the fuel
for star formation, which progressively removes gas as it flows inwards. We
show that magnetic stresses from magneto-rotational instability are the most
plausible source of the required viscosity, and construct a simple physical
model to explore this. A key feature is to link the magnetic field strength to
the local star-formation surface density, $B_{\rm tot} \propto \Sigma_{\rm
SFR}^\alpha$. This provides a feed-back loop between star-formation and the
flow of gas. We find that the model naturally produces stable steady-state
exponential disks, as long as $\alpha \sim$ 0.15, the value indicated from
spatially-resolved observations of nearby galaxies. The disk scale-length
$h_{\rm R}$ is set by the rate at which the disk is fed, by the normalization
of the $B_{\rm tot}-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation and by the circular velocity of
the halo. The angular momentum distribution of the gas and stars within the
disk is a consequence of the transfer of angular momentum that is inherent to
the operation of an accretion disk, rather than the initial angular momentum of
the inflowing material. We suggest that magnetic stresses likely play a major
role in establishing the stable exponential form of galactic disks.

Title:BASS XXXI: Outflow scaling relations in low redshift X-ray AGN host galaxies with MUSE,"
Abstract:  Ionised gas kinematics provide crucial evidence of the impact that active
galactic nuclei (AGN) have in regulating star formation in their host galaxies.
Although the presence of outflows in AGN host galaxies has been firmly
established, the calculation of outflow properties such as mass outflow rates
and kinetic energy remains challenging. We present the [OIII]5007 ionised gas
outflow properties of 22 z$<$0.1 X-ray AGN, derived from the BAT AGN
Spectroscopic Survey using MUSE/VLT. With an average spatial resolution of 1""
(0.1-1.2 kpc), the observations resolve the ionised gas clouds down to
sub-kiloparsec scales. Resolved maps show that the [OIII] velocity dispersion
is, on average, higher in regions ionised by the AGN, compared to star
formation. We calculate the instantaneous outflow rates in individual MUSE
spaxels by constructing resolved mass outflow rate maps, incorporating variable
outflow density and velocity. We compare the instantaneous values with
time-averaged outflow rates by placing mock fibres and slits on the MUSE
field-of-view, a method often used in the literature. The instantaneous outflow
rates (0.2-275 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) tend to be 2 orders of magnitude higher
than the time-averaged outflow rates (0.001-40 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). The
outflow rates correlate with the AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}\sim$
10$^{42.71}$-10$^{45.62}$ erg/s) but we find no correlations with black hole
mass (10$^{6.1}$-10$^{8.9}$ M$_{\odot}$), Eddington ratio (0.002-1.1) and radio
luminosity (10$^{21}$-10$^{26}$ W/Hz). We find the median coupling between the
kinetic energy and $L_{\rm bol}$ to be 1%, consistent with the theoretical
predictions for an AGN-driven outflow.

Title:The Gas-phase Metallicity Profiles of Star-forming Galaxies in the Modified Accretion Disk Framework,"
Abstract:  Simulations indicate that the inflow of gas of star-forming galaxies is
almost co-planar and co-rotating with the gas disk, and that the outflow of gas
driven by stellar winds and/or supernova explosions is preferentially
perpendicular to the disk. This indicates that the galactic gas disk can be
treated as a modified accretion disk. In this work, we focus on the metal
enhancement in galactic disks in this scenario of gas accretion. Assuming that
the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) is of exponential
form, we obtain the analytic solution of gas-phase metallicity with only three
free parameters: the scalelength of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ ($h_{\rm R}$), the
metallicity of the inflowing gas and the mass-loading factor defined as the
wind-driven outflow rate surface density per $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. According to
this simple model, the negative gradient of gas-phase metallicity is a natural
consequence of the radial inflow of cold gas which is continuously enriched by
in-situ star formation as it moves towards the disk center. We fit the model to
the observed metallicity profiles for six nearby galaxies chosen to have
well-measured metallicity profiles extending to very large radii. Our model can
well characterize the overall features of the observed metallicity profiles.
The observed profiles usually show a floor at the outer regions of the disk,
corresponding to the metallicity of inflow gas. Furthermore, we find the
$h_{\rm R}$ of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ inferred from these fits agree well with
independent estimates from $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ profiles, supporting the basic
model.

Title:Variable and super-sonic winds in the atmosphere of an ultra-hot giant planet,"
Abstract:  Hot Jupiters receive intense irradiation from their stellar hosts. The
resulting extreme environments in their atmospheres allow us to study the
conditions that drive planetary atmospheric dynamics, e.g., global-scale winds.
General circulation models predict day-to-nightside winds and equatorial jets
with speeds on the order of a few km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. To test these models,
we apply high-resolution transmission spectroscopy using the PEPSI spectrograph
on the Large Binocular Telescope to study the atmosphere of KELT-9 b, an
ultra-hot Jupiter and currently the hottest known planet. We measure $\sim$10
km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ day-to-nightside winds traced by Fe II features in the
planet's atmosphere. This is at odds with previous literature (including data
taken with PEPSI), which report no significant day-to-nightside winds on KELT-9
b. We identify the cause of this discrepancy as due to an inaccurate ephemeris
for KELT-9 b in previous literature. We update the ephemeris, which shifts the
mid-transit time by up to 10 minutes for previous datasets, resulting in
consistent detections of blueshifts in all the datasets analyzed here.
Furthermore, a comparison with archival HARPS-N datasets suggests temporal wind
variability $\sim$5-8 km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ over timescales between weeks to
years. Temporal variability of atmospheric dynamics on hot Jupiters is a
phenomenon anticipated by certain general circulation models that has not been
observed over these timescales until now. However, such large variability as we
measure on KELT-9 b challenges general circulation models, which predict much
lower amplitudes of wind variability over timescales between days to weeks.

Title:The impact of young radio jets traced by cold molecular gas,"
Abstract:  Ranging from a few pc to hundreds of kpc in size, radio jets have, during
their evolution, an impact on their gaseous environment on a large range of
scales. While their effect on larger scales is well established, it is now
becoming clear that they can also strongly affect the interstellar medium (ISM)
inside the host galaxy. Particularly important is the initial phase ($<10^6$
yr) of the evolution of the radio jet, when they expand into the inner few kpc
of the host galaxy. Here we report on results obtained for a representative
group of young radio galaxies using the cold molecular gas as a tracer of
jet-ISM interactions. The sensitivity and high spatial resolution of ALMA and
NOEMA are ideal to study the details of this process. In many objects we find
massive molecular outflows driven by the plasma jet, even in low-power radio
sources. However, the observed outflows are limited to the circumnuclear
regions and only a small fraction of the ISM is leaving the galaxy. Beyond this
region, the impact of the jet seems to change. Fast outflows are replaced by a
milder expansion driven by the expanding cocoon created by the jet-ISM
interaction, resulting in dispersing and heating the ISM. These findings are in
line with predictions from simulations of jets interacting with a clumpy medium
and suggest a more complex view of the impact of AGN than presently implemented
in cosmological simulations.

sample likely includes 13 low-mass and one extremely low-mass white dwarf
candidate, considering the mass determinations from fitting Gaia magnitudes and
parallax. In addition, we present follow-up time series photometry from
ground-based telescopes for 11 objects, which allowed us to detect a larger
number of periods. For each object, we analysed the period spectra and
performed an asteroseismological analysis, and we estimate the structure
parameters of the sample, i.e., stellar mass, effective temperature and
hydrogen envelope mass. We estimate a mean asteroseismological mass of <Msis>_~
0.635 +/-0.015 Msun, excluding the candidate low or extremely-low mass objects.
This value is in agreement with the mean mass using estimates from Gaia data,
which is <Mphot> ~ 0.631 +/- 0.040 Msun, and with the mean mass of previously
known ZZ Cetis of <M*>= 0.644 +/-0.034 Msun. Our sample of 74 new bright
ZZ~Cetis increases the number of known ZZ~Cetis by $\sim$20 per cent.

Title:The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury: Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER). III. The Mass Function of Young Star Clusters in M33,"
Abstract:  We measure the star cluster mass function for the Local Group galaxy M33. We
use the catalog of stellar clusters selected from the Panchromatic Hubble
Andromeda Treasury: Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER) survey. We analyze 711
clusters in M33 with $\rm 7.0 < log(Age/yr) < 8.5$, and log($M/M_{\odot}$) $>$
3.0 as determined from color-magnitude diagram fits to individual stars. The
M33 cluster mass function is best described by a Schechter function with power
law slope $\alpha = -2.06^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$, and truncation mass
log($M_c/M_{\odot}$) $= 4.24^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$. The data show strong evidence
for a high-mass truncation, thus strongly favoring a Schechter function fit
over a pure power law. M33's truncation mass is consistent with the previously
identified linear trend between $M_c$, and star formation rate surface density,
\SigSFR. We also explore the effect that individual cluster mass uncertainties
have on derived mass function parameters, and find evidence to suggest that
large cluster mass uncertainties have the potential to bias the truncation mass
of fitted mass functions on the one sigma level.

Abstract:  Because of its complex clumpy wind, prominent cyclotron resonant scattering
features, intrinsic variability and convenient physical parameters (close
distance, high inclination, small orbital separation) which facilitate the
observation and analysis of the system, Vela X-1 is one of the key systems to
understand accretion processes in high-mass X-ray binaries on all scales. We
revisit Vela X-1 with two new observations taken with NuSTAR at orbital phases
~0.68-0.78 and ~0.36-0.52 which show a plethora of variability and allow us to
study the accretion geometry and stellar wind properties of the system. We
follow the evolution of spectral parameters down to the pulse period time-scale
using a partially covered powerlaw continuum with a Fermi-Dirac cut-off to
model the continuum and local absorption. We could confirm anti-correlations
between the photon index and the luminosity and, for low fluxes, between the
folding energy and the luminosity, implying a change of properties in the
Comptonising plasma. We could not confirm a previously seen correlation between
the cyclotron line energy and the luminosity of the source in the overall
observation, but we observed a drop in the cyclotron line energy following a
strong flare. We see strong variability in absorption between the two
observations and within one observation (for the ~0.36-0.52 orbital phases)

accretion- and photoionisation wakes in the system and our variable line of

enhanced emission at the polar caps and equatorial torus for low ionization

radial velocities are compatible with a homogeneous expansion velocity of v=590
km s$^{-1}$ and a system inclination angle of 24$^o$. These values were used to
estimate an expansion parallax distance of 1200 $\pm$ 400 pc. The NIRC2 data
indicate the presence of dust in 2016 and 2017, but no dust emission could be
detected in 2019. The observational data were used for assembling 3D

central source has a temperature of $1.88\times10^{5}$ K and a luminosity of
$1.6\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in August of 2017 (2.4 years post eruption),
and that the shell has a mass of $6.3\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$. The models
also suggest an anisotropy of the ionizing flux, possibly by the contribution
from a luminous accretion disc.

Title:Tidal virialization of dark matter haloes with clustering dark energy,"
Abstract:  We extend the analysis of Pace et al., JCAP, 2019, 060, by considering the
virialization process in the extended spherical collapse model for clustering
dark-energy models, i.e., accounting for dark-energy fluctuations. Differently
from the standard approach, here virialization is naturally achieved by
properly modelling deviations from sphericity due to shear and rotation induced
by tidal interactions. We investigate the time evolution of the virial
overdensity $\Delta_\mathrm{vir}$ in seven clustering dynamical dark energy
models and compare the results to the $\Lambda$CDM model and to the
corresponding smooth dark-energy models. Taking into account all the
appropriate corrections, we deduce the abundance of convergence peaks for Rubin
Observatory-LSST and Euclid-like weak-lensing surveys, of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
peaks for a Simon Observatory-like CMB survey, and of X-ray peaks for an
eROSITA-like survey. Despite the tiny differences in $\Delta_\mathrm{vir}$
between clustering and smooth dark-energy models, owing to the large volumes
covered by these surveys, five out of seven clustering dark-energy models can
be statistically distinguished from $\Lambda$CDM. The contribution of
dark-energy fluctuation cannot be neglected, especially for the
Chevallier-Polarski-Limber and Albrecht-Skordis models, provided the
instrumental configurations provide high signal-to-noise ratio. These results
are almost independent of the tidal virialization model.

Abstract:  We report observations of the recently discovered warm Neptune TOI-674 b

Camera 3 instrument. TOI-674 b is in the Neptune desert, an observed paucity of
Neptune-size exoplanets at short orbital periods. Planets in the desert are
thought to have complex evolutionary histories due to photoevaporative mass
loss or orbital migration, making identifying the constituents of their
atmospheres critical to understanding their origins. We obtained near-infrared
transmission spectroscopy of the planet's atmosphere with the G141 grism. After
extracting, detrending, and fitting the spectral lightcurves to measure the
planet's transmission spectrum, we used the petitRADTRANS atmospheric spectral
synthesis code to perform retrievals on the planet's atmosphere to identify
which absorbers are present. These results show moderate evidence for increased
absorption at 1.4 $\mu$m due to water vapor at 2.9$\sigma$ (Bayes factor =
15.8), as well as weak evidence for the presence of clouds at 2.2$\sigma$
(Bayes factor = 4.0). TOI-674 b is a strong candidate for further study to
refine the water abundance, which is poorly constrained by our data. We also
incorporated new TESS short-cadence optical photometry, as well as Spitzer/IRAC
data, and re-fit the transit parameters for the planet. We find the planet to
have the following transit parameters: $R_p/R_* = 0.1135\pm0.0006$, $T_0 =
2458544.523792\pm0.000452$ BJD, and $P = 1.977198\pm0.00007$ d. These
measurements refine the planet radius estimate and improve the orbital
ephemerides for future transit spectroscopy observations of this highly

Title:Stress-Testing Cosmic Ray Physics: The Impact of Cosmic Rays on the Surviving Disk of Ram Pressure Stripped Galaxies,"
Abstract:  Cluster spiral galaxies suffer catastrophic losses of the cool, neutral gas
component of their interstellar medium due to ram pressure stripping,
contributing to the observed quenching of star formation in the disk compared
to galaxies in lower density environments. However, the short term effects of
ram pressure on the star formation rate and AGN activity of galaxies undergoing
stripping remain unclear. Numerical studies have recently demonstrated cosmic
rays can dramatically influence galaxy evolution for isolated galaxies, yet
their influence on ram pressure stripping remains poorly constrained. We
perform the first cosmic-ray magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of an $L_{*}$
galaxy undergoing ram pressure stripping, including radiative cooling,
self-gravity of the gas, star formation, and stellar feedback. We find the
microscopic transport of cosmic rays plays a key role in modulating the star
formation enhancement experienced by spirals at the outskirts of clusters
compared to isolated spirals. Moreover, we find that galaxies undergoing ram
pressure stripping exhibit enhanced gas accretion onto their centers, which may
explain the prevalence of AGN in these objects. In agreement with observations,
we find cosmic rays significantly boost the global radio emission of cluster
spirals. Although the gas removal rate is relatively insensitive to cosmic ray
physics, we find that cosmic rays significantly modify the phase distribution
of the remaining gas disk. These results suggest observations of galaxies
undergoing ram pressure stripping may place novel constraints on cosmic-ray
calorimetry and transport.

Abstract:  To settle the question of the nature of the interstellar object 1I/'Oumuamua
requires in-situ observations via a spacecraft, as the object is already out of
range of existing telescopes. Most previous proposals for reaching 1I/'Oumuamua
using near-term technologies are based on the Solar Oberth Manoeuvre (SOM), as
trajectories without the SOM are generally significantly inferior in terms of
lower mission duration and higher total velocity requirement. While the SOM
allows huge velocity gains, it is also technically challenging and thereby
increases programmatic and mission-related risks. In this paper, we identify an
alternative route to the interstellar object 1I/'Oumuamua, based on a launch in
2028, which does not require a SOM but has a similar performance as missions
with a SOM. It instead employs a Jupiter Oberth Manoeuvre (JOM) with a total
time of flight of around 26 years or so. The efficacy of this trajectory is a
result of it significantly reducing the $\Delta$V to Jupiter by exploiting the
VEEGA sequence. The total $\Delta$V of the trajectory is 15.8 $kms^{-1}$ and
the corresponding payload mass is 115 kg for a SLS Block 1B or 241 kg for a
Block 2. A further advantage of the JOM is that the arrival speed relative to
1I/'Oumuamua is approximately 18 $kms^{-1}$, much lower than the equivalent for
the SOM of around 30 $kms^{-1}$.

Title:Modelling annual scintillation arc variations in PSR J1643-1224 using the Large European Array for Pulsars,"
Abstract:  In this work we study variations in the parabolic scintillation arcs of the
binary millisecond pulsar PSR J1643-1224 over five years using the Large
European Array for Pulsars (LEAP). The 2D power spectrum of scintillation,
called the secondary spectrum, often shows a parabolic distribution of power,
where the arc curvature encodes the relative velocities and distances of the
pulsar, ionised interstellar medium (IISM), and Earth. We observe a clear
parabolic scintillation arc which varies in curvature throughout the year. The
distribution of power in the secondary spectra are inconsistent with a single
scattering screen which is fully 1D, or entirely isotropic. We fit the observed
arc curvature variations with two models; an isotropic scattering screen, and a
model with two independent 1D screens. We measure the distance to the
scattering screen to be in the range 114-223 pc, depending on the model,
consistent with the known distance of the foreground large-diameter HII region
Sh 2-27 (112+/-17 pc), suggesting that it is the dominant source of scattering.
We obtain only weak constraints on the pulsar's orbital inclination and angle
of periastron, since the scintillation pattern is not very sensitive to the
pulsar's motion, since the screen is much closer to the Earth than the pulsar.
More measurements of this kind - where scattering screens can be associated
with foreground objects - will help to inform the origins and distribution of
scattering screens within our galaxy.

Title:Velocity structure of the 50 pc-long NGC 6334 filamentary cloud: Hints of multiple compressions and their impact on the cloud properties?,"
Abstract:  [Abridged] The interstellar medium is observed to be organised in filamentary
structures, as well as neutral (HI) and ionized (HII) bubbles. The expanding
nature of these bubbles makes them shape their surroundings and possibly play a
role in the formation and evolution of interstellar filaments. We present APEX
$^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O(2-1) observations of the NGC 6334 molecular cloud. We
investigate the gas velocity structure along and across the 50 pc-long cloud
and towards 75 identified velocity-coherent-filaments (VCFs). We measure a
wealth of velocity gradients along the VCFs. We derive the column density and
velocity power spectra of the VCFs. These power spectra are well represented
with power laws showing similar slopes for both quantities (with a mean of
about -2), albeit some differ by up to a factor of two. The position velocity
diagrams perpendicular to three VCFs show the V-shaped velocity pattern,
corresponding to a bent structure in velocity space with the filament at the
tip of the V surrounded by an extended structure connected to it with a
velocity gradient. This velocity structure is qualitatively similar to that
resulting from numerical simulations of filament formation from large-scale
compression from propagating shock fronts. In addition, the radial profiles
perpendicular to these VCFs hint to small-scale internal impacts from
neighbouring HII bubbles. The observed opposite curvature in velocity space
towards the VCFs points to various origins of large-scale external compressions
from propagating HI bubbles. This suggests the plausible importance of multiple
HI compressions, separated in space and time, in the formation and evolution of
molecular clouds and their star formation history. These latter atomic
compressions due to past and distant star formation events are complemented by
the impact of HII bubbles from present time and local star formation activity.

Title:IR SED and Dust Masses of Sub-solar Metallicity Galaxies at z~2.3,"
Abstract:  We present results from ALMA 1.2mm continuum observations of a sample of 27
star-forming galaxies at z=2.1-2.5 from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field
(MOSDEF) survey. These galaxies have gas-phase metallicity and star-formation
rate measurements from Hb, [OIII], Ha, and [NII]. Using stacks of Spitzer,
Herschel, and ALMA photometry (rest-frame ~ 8-400$\mu$m), we examine the IR SED
of high-redshift subsolar metallicity (~0.5 $Z_{\odot}$) LIRGs. We find that
the data agree well with an average SED template of higher luminosity local
low-metallicity dwarf galaxies (reduced $\chi^2$ of 1.8). When compared with
the commonly used templates for solar-metallicity local galaxies or
high-redshift LIRGs and ULIRGs, even in the most favorable case (with reduced
$\chi^2$ of 2.8), the templates are rejected at >98% confidence level. The
broader and hotter IR SED of both the local dwarfs and high-redshift subsolar
metallicity galaxies may result from different grain properties, a clumpy dust
geometry, or a harder/more intense ionizing radiation field that heats the dust
to higher temperatures. The obscured SFR indicated by the FIR emission of the
subsolar metallicity galaxies is only ~ 60% of the total SFR, which is
considerably lower than that of the local LIRGs with ~ 96-97% obscured
fractions. Due to the evolving IR SED shape, the local LIRG templates fit to
mid-IR data can overestimate the Rayleigh-Jeans tail measurements at z~2 by a
factor of 2-20, and these templates underestimate IR luminosities if fit to the
observed ALMA fluxes by >0.4dex. At a given stellar mass or metallicity, dust
masses at z~2.3 are an order of magnitude higher than those at z~0. Given the
predicted molecular gas mass fractions, the observed z~2.3 dust-to-stellar mass
ratios suggest lower dust-to-molecular gas masses than in local galaxies at the
same metallicity.

Title:Imaging the Southern Sky at 159MHz using Spherical Harmonics with the Engineering Development Array 2,"
Abstract:  One of the major priorities of international radio astronomy is to study the
early universe through the detection of the 21 cm HI line from the epoch of
reionisation (EoR). Due to the weak nature of the 21 cm signal, an important
part in the detection of the EoR is removing contaminating foregrounds from our
observations as they are multiple orders of magnitude brighter. In order to
achieve this, sky maps spanning a wide range of frequencies and angular scales
are required for calibration and foreground subtraction. Complementing the
existing low-frequency sky maps, we have constructed a Southern Sky map through
spherical harmonic transit interferometry utilising the engineering development
array 2 (EDA2), a square kilometre array (SKA) low-frequency array prototype
system. We use the m-mode formalism to create an all-sky map at 159MHz with an
angular resolution of 3 degrees, with data from the (EDA2) providing
information over +60 degrees to -90 degrees in declination. We also introduce a
new method for visualising and quantifying how the baseline distribution of an
interferometer maps to the spherical harmonics, and discuss how prior
information can be used to constrain spherical harmonic components that the
interferometer is not sensitive to.

Title:Characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres through a model-unbiased spectral survey methodology,"
Abstract:  Context. Collecting a large variety of exoplanetary atmosphere measurements
is crucial to improve our understanding of exoplanets. In this context, it is
likely that the field would benefit from broad species surveys, particularly
using transit spectroscopy, which is the most successful technique of
exoplanetary atmosphere characterization so far.
Aims: Our goal is to develop a model-unbiased technique using transit
spectroscopy to analyze every qualified atomic spectral line in exoplanetary
transit data, and search for relative absorption, that is, a decrease in the
flux of the line when the planet is transiting.
Methods: We analyzed archive data from HDS at Subaru, HIRES at Keck, UVES at
VLT, and HARPS at LaSilla to test our spectral survey methodology. It first
filtered individual lines by relative noise levels. It also corrected for
spectral offsets and telluric contamination. Our methodology performed an
analysis along time and wavelength. The latter employed a bootstrap
corroboration.
Results: We highlight the possible detections of Mn I and V II in HD 209459b
data taken by HDS at Subaru ($5.9\sigma$ at 5916.4 $\angstrom$, $5.1\sigma$ at
6021.8 $\angstrom$). The previous detection of Ca I in the same planet is
classified as inconclusive by our algorithm, but we support the previous
detection of Sc II ($3.5\sigma$ at 6604.6 $\angstrom$). We also highlight the
possible detection of Ca I, Sc II, and Ti II in HD 189733 data taken by UVES at
VLT ($4.4\sigma$ at $6572.8 \angstrom$, $6.8\sigma$ at $6604.6 \angstrom$, and
$3.5\sigma$ at $5910.1 \angstrom$), in addition to the possible detection of Al
I in WASP-74b data taken by UVES at VLT ($5.6 \sigma$ at $6696.0 \angstrom$).

"Title:The importance of silicate vapor in determining the structure, radii, and envelope mass fractions of sub-Neptunes","
Abstract:  Substantial silicate vapor is expected to be in chemical equilibrium at
temperature conditions typical of the silicate-atmosphere interface of
sub-Neptune planets, which can exceed 5000 K. Previous models of the
atmospheric structure and evolution of these exoplanets, which have been used
to constrain their atmospheric mass fractions, have neglected this
compositional coupling. In this work, we show that silicate vapor in a
hydrogen-dominated atmosphere acts as a condensable species, decreasing in
abundance with altitude. The resultant mean molecular weight gradient inhibits
convection at temperatures above $\sim 4000$ K, inducing a near-surface
radiative layer. This radiative layer decreases the planet's total radius
compared to a planet with the same base temperature and a convective, pure H/He
atmosphere. Therefore, we expect silicate vapor to have major effects on the
inferred envelope mass fraction and thermal evolution of sub-Neptune planets.
We demonstrate that differences in radii, and hence in inferred atmospheric
masses, are largest for planets which have larger masses, equilibrium
temperatures, and atmospheric mass fractions. The effects are largest for
younger planets, but differences can persist on gigayear time-scales for some
sub-Neptunes. For a $10 M_\oplus$ planet with $T_\mathrm{eq}=1000$ K and an age
of $\sim 300$ Myr, an observed radius consistent with an atmospheric mass
fraction of 10% when accounting for silicate vapor would be misinterpreted as
indicating an atmospheric mass fraction of 2% if a H/He-only atmosphere were
assumed. The presence of silicate vapor in the atmosphere is also expected to
have important implications for the accretion and loss of primordial hydrogen
atmospheres.

Title:OGLE-2016-BLG-1093Lb: A Sub-Jupiter-mass Spitzer Planet Located in Galactic Bulge,"
Abstract:  OGLE-2016-BLG-1093 is a planetary microlensing event that is part of the
statistical $Spitzer$ microlens parallax sample. The precise measurement of the
microlens parallax effect for this event, combined with the measurement of
finite source effects, leads to a direct measurement of the lens masses and
system distance: $M_{\rm host} = 0.38$--$0.57\, M_{\odot}$, $m_p =
0.59$--$0.87\, M_{\rm Jup}$, and the system is located at the Galactic bulge
($D_L \sim 8.1$ kpc). Because this was a high-magnification event, we are also
able to empirically show that the ""cheap-space parallax"" concept Gould & Yee
(2012) produces well-constrained (and consistent) results for $|\pi_{\rm E}|$.
This demonstrates that this concept can be extended to many two-body lenses.
Finally, we briefly explore systematics in the $Spitzer$ light curve in this
event and show that their potential impact is strongly mitigated by the
color-constraint.

Title:Time-resolved spectroscopy on the heartbeat state of GRS 1915+105 using AstroSat,"
Abstract:  AstroSat spectra of the black hole system GRS 1915+105 during the heartbeat
state (with a varying oscillation period from 150 to 100 secs) were analysed
using a truncated relativistic disc model along with a Comptonization
component. Spectra were fitted for segments of length ~ 24 secs. The
oscillation can be described as coordinated variations of the accretion rate,
Comptonised flux, and the inner disc radius, with the latter ranging from
1.235-5 gravitational radii. Comparison with results from the $\chi$ and
Intermediate states shows that while the accretion rate and the high energy
photon index were similar, the inner disc radius and the fraction of
Comptonised photons were larger for these states than for the heartbeat one.
The coronal efficiency $\eta \equiv L_{ac}/\dot M c^2$, where $L_{ac}$ is the
radiative luminosity generated in the corona is found to be approximately
$\propto \dot M^{-2/3}$ for all the observations. The efficiency decreases with
inner radii for the heartbeat state but has similar values for the $\chi$ and
Intermediate states where the inner radii is larger. The implications of these
results are discussed.

Title:Removing the divergence of Chandrasekhar limit caused by generalized uncertainty principle,"
Abstract:  The usual generalized uncertainty principle will lead to a divergent mass
limit of white dwarf, and this divergence should be prevented for both
scenarios including positive and negative parameters of generalized uncertainty
principle. Although it has been shown that negative parameter can directly
restore the mass limit, the underlying reason is not given to explain why the
negative sign appears under the condition of white dwarf. In order to solve
this problem, we derive a field-dependent parameter expression whose sign can
change depending on the species of spin fields. Besides, we find that the
actual physical effect of the negative sign is aimed at limiting the exorbitant
uncertainty of momentum.

Title:Tracing Milky Way scattering by compact extragalactic radio sources,"
Abstract:  We used archival very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data of active
galactic nuclei (AGN) observed from 1.4 GHz to 86 GHz to measure the angular
size of VLBI radio cores in 8959 AGNs. We analysed their sky distributions,
frequency dependencies and created the most densely sampled and complete to
date distribution map of large-scale scattering properties of the interstellar
medium in our Galaxy. Significant angular broadening of the measured AGN core
sizes is detected for the sources seen through the Galactic plane, and this
effect is especially strong at low frequencies (e.g., at 2 GHz). The scattering
screens containing electron density fluctuations of hot plasma are mainly
concentrated in the Galactic plane and manifest clumpy distribution. The region
of the strongest scattering is the Galactic centre, where the Galactic bar and
the compact radio source Sagittarius A* are located. We have also found the
enhancement of scattering strength in regions of the Cygnus constellation,
supernova remnants Taurus A, Vela, W78 and Cassiopeia A, and the Orion Nebula.
Using multi-frequency observational data of AGN core sizes, we separated the
contribution of the intrinsic and scattered sizes to the measured angular
diameter for 1411 sources. For the sources observed through the Galactic plane,
the contribution of the scattered size component is systematically larger than
for those seen outside the Galactic plane. The derived power-law scattering
indices are found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the
diffractive-dominated scattering of radio emission in a hot plasma with
Gaussian distribution of density inhomogeneities.

Title:Transonic accretion and winds around Pseudo-Kerr black holes and comparison with general relativistic solutions,"
Abstract:  Spectral and timing properties of accretion flows on a black hole depend on
their density and temperature distributions, which in turn come from the
underlying dynamics. Thus, an accurate description of the flow which includes
hydrodynamics and radiative transfer is a must to interpret the observational
results. In the case of non-rotating black holes, Pseudo-Newtonian description
of surrounding space-time enables one to make a significant progress in
predicting spectral and timing properties. This formalism is lacking for
spinning black holes. In this paper, we show that there exists an exact form of
'natural' potential derivable from the general relativistic (GR) radial
momentum equation. Use of this potential in an otherwise Newtonian set of
equations allows to describe transonic flows very accurately as is evidenced by
comparing with solutions obtained from the full GR framework. We study the
properties of the critical points and the centrifugal pressure supported shocks
in the parameter space spanned by the specific energy and the angular momentum,
and compare with the results of GR hydrodynamics. We show that this potential
can safely be used for the entire range of Kerr parameter $-1<a<1$ for modeling
of observational results around spinning black holes. We assume the flow to be
inviscid. Thus, it is non-dissipative with constant energy and angular
momentum. These assumptions are valid very close to the black hole as the
infall timescale is much shorter as compared to the viscous timescale.

Abstract:  Modeling of frequency-dependent effects, contributed by the turbulence in the

background in pulsar timing data. In this work, we present an investigation of
temporal variations of interstellar medium for a set of millisecond pulsars
(MSPs) with the upgraded GMRT aided by large fractional bandwidth at lower
observing frequencies. Contrary to the conventional narrow-band analysis using
a frequency invariant template profile, we applied $PulsePortraiture$ based
wide-band timing analysis while correcting for the evolution of the pulsar
profile with frequency. Implementation of $PulsePortraiture$ based wide-band
timing method for the GMRT discovered MSPs to probe the DM variations resulted
in a DM precision of $10^{-4}\,pc~cm^{-3}$. In general, we achieve similar DM
and timing precision from wide-band timing compared to the narrow-band timing
with matching temporal variations of DMs. This wide-band timing study of newly
discovered MSPs over a wide frequency range highlights the effectiveness of
profile-modeling at low frequencies and probes the potential of using them in

Title:Estimating the Photometric Redshifts of Galaxies and QSOs Using Regression Techniques in Machine Learning,"
Abstract:  Measuring distances of cosmological sources such as galaxies, stars and
quasars plays an increasingly critical role in modern cosmology. Obtaining the
optical spectrum and consequently calculating the redshift as a distance
indicator could instantly classify these objects. As long as spectroscopic
observations are not available for many galaxies and the process of measuring
the redshift is time-consuming and infeasible for large samples, machine
learning (ML) approaches could be applied to determine the redshifts of
galaxies from different features including their photometric colors. In this
paper, by using the flux magnitudes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
catalog, we develop two ML regression algorithms (Decision Tree and Random
Forest) for estimating the redshifts taking color indices as input features. We
find that the Random Forest algorithm produces the optimum result for the
redshift prediction, and it will be further improved when the dataset is
limited to a subset with z $\le$ 2 giving the normalised standard deviation
$\overline{\Delta Z}_{\text {norm}}=0.005$ and the standard deviation
$\sigma_{\Delta z}=0.12$. This work shows a great potential of using the ML
approach to determine the photometric redshifts of distant sources.

Title:A bimodal distribution of haze in Pluto's atmosphere,"
Abstract:  Pluto, Titan, and Triton make up a unique class of solar system bodies, with
icy surfaces and chemically reducing atmospheres rich in organic photochemistry
and haze formation. Hazes play important roles in these atmospheres, with
physical and chemical processes highly dependent on particle sizes, but the
haze size distribution in reducing atmospheres is currently poorly understood.
Here we report observational evidence that Pluto's haze particles are bimodally
distributed, which successfully reproduces the full phase scattering
observations from New Horizons. Combined with previous simulations of Titan's
haze, this result suggests that haze particles in reducing atmospheres undergo
rapid shape change near pressure levels ~0.5Pa and favors a photochemical
rather than a dynamical origin for the formation of Titan's detached haze. It
also demonstrates that both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres can produce
multi-modal hazes, and encourages reanalysis of observations of hazes on Titan
and Triton.

Abstract:  The recent discovery of periodic pulsations from several members of the
ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) family in nearby galaxies as well as in our
own galaxy unveiled the nature of the accreting compact object. Neutron stars
rather than black holes are currently believed to power a substantial number of
ULXs whether or not pulsations are observed. The detection of cyclotron
absorption lines in the X-ray spectrum of a ULX provides an alternative way to
identify the compact object as a neutron star. Among the non-pulsating ULXs,
the presence of a cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) in the spectrum
of M51 ULX-8 has been reported. In the present work, the magnetic field
strength on the surface of the neutron star in M51 ULX-8 is inferred from the
energy of the observed CRSF to estimate the beaming fraction in X-ray emission
and more importantly the observable range for the elusive neutron-star spin
period to be hopefully discovered by the forthcoming space missions in the near

Title:The impact of faculae on the radius determination of exoplanets: The case of the M-star GJ1214,"
Abstract:  Precise measurements of exoplanets radii are of key importance for our
understanding of the origin and nature of these objects. Measurement of the
planet radii using the transit method have reached a precision that the effects
of stellar surface features have to be taken into account. While the effects
from spots have already been studied in detail, our knowledge of the effects
caused by faculae is still limited. This is particularly the case for M-stars.
Faculae can pose a problem if they are inhomogeneously distributed on the
stellar surface. Using the eclipse mapping method, we study the distribution of
the faculae on the surface of GJ1214 using the CaIIH&K lines as tracers. In
order to assess the homogeneity of the distribution in a quantitative way, we
introduce the inhomogeneity factor IHF. IHF is 0% if the distribution is
homogeneous, positive, if the plage regions are preferentially located along
the path of the planet, and negative, if they are preferentially located
outside the path of the planet. For GJ1214, we derive a rather small value of
IHF=7.7-7.7+12.0%. We discuss the relevance of this result in the context of
the PLATO and ARIEL missions.

"Title:The vertical shear instability in poorly ionised, magnetized protoplanetary discs","
Abstract:  Protoplanetary discs should exhibit a weak vertical variation in their
rotation profiles. Typically this `vertical shear' issues from a baroclinic
effect driven by the central star's radiation field, but it might also arise
during the launching of a magnetocentrifugal wind. As a consequence,
protoplanetary discs are subject to a hydrodynamical instability, the `vertical
shear instability' (VSI), whose breakdown into turbulence could transport a
moderate amount of angular momentum and facilitate, or interfere with, the
process of planet formation. Magnetic fields may suppress the VSI, however,
either directly via magnetic tension or indirectly through magnetorotational
turbulence. On the other hand, protoplanetary discs exhibit notoriously low
ionisation fractions, and non-ideal effects, if sufficiently dominant, may come
to the VSI's rescue. In this paper we develop a local linear theory that
explores how non-ideal MHD influences the VSI, while also launching additional
diffusive shear instabilities. We derive a set of analytical criteria that
establish when the VSI prevails, and then show how it can be applied to a
realistic global model of a protoplanetary disc. Our calculations suggest that
within ~10au the VSI should have little trouble emerging in the main body of
the disk, but beyond that, and in the upper regions of the disc, its onset
depends sensitively on the size of the preponderant dust grains.

Title:Accretion mode versus radio morphology in the LOFAR Deep Fields,"
Abstract:  Radio-loud active galaxies have two accretion modes [radiatively inefficient
(RI) and radiatively efficient (RE)], with distinct optical and infrared
signatures, and two jet dynamical behaviours, which in arcsec- to
arcmin-resolution radio surveys manifest primarily as centre- or
edge-brightened structures [Fanaroff-Riley (FR) class I and II]. The nature of
the relationship between accretion mode and radio morphology (FR class) has
been the subject of long debate. We present a comprehensive investigation of
this relationship for a sample of 286 well-resolved radio galaxies in the LOFAR
Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields (LoTSS-Deep) first data release, for which
robust morphological and accretion mode classifications have been made. We find
that two-thirds of luminous FRII radio galaxies are RI, and identify no
significant differences in the visual appearance or source dynamic range
(peak/mean surface brightness) of the RI and RE FRIIs, demonstrating that both
RI and RE systems can produce FRII structures. We also find a significant
population of low-luminosity FRIIs (predominantly RI), supporting our earlier
conclusion that FRII radio structures can be produced at all radio
luminosities. We demonstrate that in the luminosity range where both
morphologies are present, the probability of producing FRI or FRII radio
morphology is directly linked to stellar mass, while across all morphologies
and luminosities, RE accretion occurs in systems with high specific star
formation rate, presumably because this traces fuel availability. In summary,
the relationship between accretion mode and radio morphology is very indirect,
with host-galaxy environment controlling these two key parameters in different
ways.

homogeneously analysed data from the three EPIC cameras (X-ray) and
OM(optical/UV) using the XMM-Newton SAS software, and produced images, light
curves, and spectral products for BL Lacs detected in any of the three EPIC
cameras. We tested two different phenomenological models, log parabola and
power law, with different variations of the absorbing column density and
extracted their parameters. We derived time-variability information from the
light curves following well-established statistical methods and quantified
variability through statistical indicators. OM magnitudes and fluxes were
computed wherever possible. We see that the log parabola model is preferred
over the power law model for sources showing higher fluxes, which might
indicate that curvature is intrinsic to BL Lacs and is only seen when the flux
is high. We present the results of our analysis as a catalogue of X-ray

inclination, a combination of SA and velocity-resolved RM (SARM) thereby allows
us to simultaneously determine the SMBH mass and geometric distance through
dynamically modeling the two BLRs. We construct a suite of dynamical models
with different geometric configurations and apply a Bayesian approach to obtain
the parameter inferences. Overall the obtained masses and distances are
insensitive to specific BLR configurations but more or less depend on
parameterizations of the vertical distributions. The most probable model,
chosen in light of the Bayes factor, yields an angular-size distance of
$\log\,(D_{\rm A}/{\rm Mpc}) = 2.83_{-0.28}^{+0.32}$ and SMBH mass of
$\log\,(M_\bullet/M_\odot)=9.06_{-0.27}^{+0.21}$, which agrees with the
relationships between SMBH masses and bulge properties. The BLRs have an
inclination of $5_{-1}^{+1}$ degrees, consistent with that of the large-scale
jet in 3C 273. Our approach reinforces the capability of SARM analysis to
measure SMBH mass and distance of AGNs even though SA and RM observations are
undertaken with different emission lines and/or in different periods.

Title:The Simons Observatory 220 and 280 GHz Focal-Plane Module: Design and Initial Characterization,"
Abstract:  The Simons Observatory (SO) will detect and map the temperature and
polarization of the millimeter-wavelength sky from Cerro Toco, Chile across a
range of angular scales, providing rich data sets for cosmological and
astrophysical analysis. The SO focal planes will be tiled with compact
hexagonal packages, called Universal Focal-plane Modules (UFMs), in which the
transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors are coupled to 100 mK
microwave-multiplexing electronics. Three different types of dichroic TES
detector arrays with bands centered at 30/40, 90/150, and 220/280 GHz will be
implemented across the 49 planned UFMs. The 90/150GHz and 220/280 GHz arrays
each contain 1,764 TESes, which are read out with two 910x multiplexer
circuits. The modules contain a series of densely routed silicon chips, which
are packaged together in a controlled electromagnetic environment with robust
heat-sinking to 100 mK. Following an overview of the module design, we report
on early results from the first 220/280GHz UFM, including detector yield, as
well as readout and detector noise levels.

Title:Identifying interesting planetary systems for future X-ray observations,"
Abstract:  X-ray observations of star-planet systems are important to grow our
understanding of exoplanets; these observation allow for studies of
photoevaporation of the exoplanetary atmosphere, and in some cases even
estimations of the size of the outer planetary atmosphere. The German-Russian
eROSITA instrument onboard the SRG (Spectrum Roentgen Gamma) mission is
performing the first all-sky X-ray survey since the 1990s, and provides X-ray
fluxes and spectra of exoplanet host stars over a much larger volume than was
accessible before. Using new eROSITA data as well as archival data from
XMM-Newton, Chandra and ROSAT we estimate mass loss rates of exoplanets under
an energy-limited escape scenario, and identify several exoplanets with strong
X-ray irradiation and expected mass-loss that are amenable to follow-up
observations at other wavelengths. We model sample spectra using a toy model of
an exoplanetary atmosphere to predict what exoplanet transit observations with
future X-ray missions such as Athena will look like, and estimate the
observable X-ray transmission spectrum for a typical Hot Jupiter-type
exoplanet.

"Title:Hazy blue worlds: A holistic aerosol model for Uranus and Neptune, including Dark Spots","
Abstract:  We present a reanalysis (using the Minnaert limb-darkening approximation) of
visible/near-infrared (0.3 - 2.5 micron) observations of Uranus and Neptune
made by several instruments. We find a common model of the vertical aerosol
distribution that is consistent with the observed reflectivity spectra of both
planets, consisting of: 1) a deep aerosol layer with a base pressure > 5-7 bar,
assumed to be composed of a mixture of H2S ice and photochemical haze; 2) a
layer of photochemical haze/ice, coincident with a layer of high static
stability at the methane condensation level at 1-2 bar; and 3) an extended
layer of photochemical haze, likely mostly of the same composition as the
1-2-bar layer, extending from this level up through to the stratosphere, where
the photochemical haze particles are thought to be produced. For Neptune, we
find that we also need to add a thin layer of micron-sized methane ice
particles at ~0.2 bar to explain the enhanced reflection at longer
methane-absorbing wavelengths. We suggest that methane condensing onto the haze
particles at the base of the 1-2-bar aerosol layer forms ice/haze particles
that grow very quickly to large size and immediately 'snow out' (as predicted
by Carlson et al. 1988), re-evaporating at deeper levels to release their core
haze particles to act as condensation nuclei for H2S ice formation. In
addition, we find that the spectral characteristics of 'dark spots', such as
the Voyager-2/ISS Great Dark Spot and the HST/WFC3 NDS-2018, are well modelled
by a darkening or possibly clearing of the deep aerosol layer only.

Title:The atmosphere and architecture of WASP-189 b probed by its CHEOPS phase curve,"
Abstract:  Gas giants orbiting close to hot and massive early-type stars can reach
dayside temperatures that are comparable to those of the coldest stars. These
""ultra-hot Jupiters"" have atmospheres made of ions and atomic species from
molecular dissociation and feature strong day-to-night temperature gradients.
Photometric observations at different orbital phases provide insights on the
planet atmospheric properties. We analyse the photometric observations of
WASP-189 acquired with the instrument CHEOPS to derive constraints on the
system architecture and the planetary atmosphere. We implement a light curve
model suited for asymmetric transit shape caused by the gravity-darkened
photosphere of the fast-rotating host star. We also model the reflective and
thermal components of the planetary flux, the effect of stellar oblateness and
light-travel time on transit-eclipse timings, the stellar activity and CHEOPS
systematics. From the asymmetric transit, we measure the size of the ultra-hot
Jupiter WASP-189 b, $R_p=1.600^{+0.017}_{-0.016}\,R_J$, with a precision of 1%,
and the true orbital obliquity of the planetary system $\Psi_p=89.6\pm1.2$
(polar orbit). We detect no significant hotspot offset from the phase curve and
obtain an eclipse depth $\delta_\text{ecl}=96.5^{+4.5}_{-5.0}\,\text{ppm}$,
from which we derive an upper limit on the geometric albedo: $A_g<0.48$. We
also find that the eclipse depth can only be explained by thermal emission
alone in the case of extremely inefficient energy redistribution. Finally, we
attribute the photometric variability to the stellar rotation, either through
superficial inhomogeneities or resonance couplings between the convective core
and the radiative envelope.

Title:Cosmological direct detection of dark energy: non-linear structure formation signatures of dark energy scattering with visible matter,"
Abstract:  We consider the recently proposed possibility that dark energy (DE) and
baryons may scatter through a pure momentum exchange process, leaving the
background evolution unaffected. Earlier work has shown that, even for
barn-scale cross-sections, the imprints of this scattering process on linear
cosmological observables is too tiny to be observed. We therefore turn our
attention to non-linear scales, and for the first time investigate the
signatures of DE-baryon scattering on the non-linear formation of cosmic
structures, by running a suite of large N-body simulations. The observables we
extract include the non-linear matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and
density and baryon fraction profiles of halos. We find that in the non-linear
regime the signatures of DE-baryon scattering are significantly larger than
their linear counterparts, due to the important role of angular momentum in
collapsing structures, and potentially observable. The most promising
observables in this sense are the baryon density and baryon fraction profiles
of halos, which can potentially be constrained by a combination of kinetic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ), thermal SZ, and weak lensing measurements. Overall, our
results indicate that future prospects for cosmological and astrophysical
direct detection of non-gravitational signatures of dark energy are extremely
bright.

"Title:An improved study of HCO+ and He system: interaction potential, collisional relaxation and pressure broadening","
Abstract:  In light of its ubiquitous presence in the interstellar gas, the chemistry
and reactivity of the HCO+ ion requires special attention. The availability of
up-to-date collisional data between this ion and the most abundant perturbing
species in the interstellar medium is a critical resource in order to derive
reliable values of its molecular abundance from astronomical observations. This
work intends to provide improved scattering parameters for the HCO+ and He
collisional system. We have tested the accuracy of explicitly correlated
coupled-cluster methods for mapping the short- and long-range multi-dimensional
potential energy surface of atom-ion systems. A validation of the methodology
employed for the calculation of the potential well has been obtained from the
comparison with experimentally derived bound-state spectroscopic parameters.
Finally, by solving the close-coupling scattering equations, we have derived
the pressure broadening and shift coefficients for the first six rotational
transitions of HCO+ as well as inelastic state-to-state transition rates up to
j = 5 in the 5-100 K temperature interval.

Title:Multiparticle collision simulations of dense stellar systems and plasmas,"
Abstract:  We summarize a series of numerical experiments of collisional dynamics in
dense stellar systems such as globular clusters (GCs) and in weakly collisional
plasmas using a novel simulation technique, the so-called Multi-particle
collision (MPC) method, alternative to Fokker-Planck and Monte Carlo
approaches. MPC is related to particle-mesh approaches for the computation of
self consistent long-range fields, ensuring that simulation time scales with
$N\log N$ in the number of particles, as opposed to $N^2$ for direct $N$-body.
The collisional relaxation effects are modelled by computing particle
interactions based on a collision operator approach that ensures rigorous
conservation of energy and momenta and depends only on particles velocities and
cell-based integrated quantities.

Title:The galaxy group NGC 507: newly detected AGN remnant plasma transported by sloshing,"
Abstract:  Jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are known to recurrently enrich their
surrounding medium with mildly-relativistic particles and magnetic fields.
Here, we present a detailed multi-frequency analysis of the nearby (z=0.01646)
galaxy group NGC 507. In particular, we present new high-sensitivity and high
spatial resolution radio images in the frequency range 144-675 MHz obtained
using LOFAR and uGMRT observations. These reveal the presence of previously
undetected diffuse radio emission with complex, filamentary morphology, likely
related to a previous outburst of the central galaxy. Based on spectral ageing
considerations, we derived that the plasma was first injected by the AGN
240-380 Myr ago and is now cooling. Our analysis of deep archival XMM-Newton
data confirms that the system is dynamically disturbed, as previously
suggested. We detect two discontinuities in the X-ray surface brightness
distribution (in East and South direction) tracing a spiral pattern, which we
interpret as cold fronts produced by sloshing motions. The remarkable spatial
coincidence observed between the newly-detected arc-like radio filament and the
southern concave X-ray discontinuity strongly suggests that the remnant plasma
has been displaced by the sloshing motions on large scales. Overall, NGC 507
represents one of the clearest examples known to date in which a direct
interaction between old AGN remnant plasma and the external medium is observed
in a galaxy group. Our results are consistent with simulations, which suggest
that filamentary emission can be created by the cluster/group weather
disrupting AGN lobes and spreading their relativistic content into the
surrounding medium.

Title:Lensing or luck? False alarm probabilities for gravitational lensing of gravitational waves,"
Abstract:  Strong gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) has been forecasted
to become detectable in the upcoming observing runs. However, definitively
distinguishing pairs of lensed sources from random associations is a
challenging problem. We investigate the degree to which unlensed events mimic
lensed ones because of the overlap of parameters due to a combination of random
coincidence and errors in parameter estimation. We construct a mock catalog of
lensed and unlensed events. We find that the false alarm probability (FAP)
based on coincidental overlaps of the chirp mass, sky location, and coalescence
phase are approximately $11\%$, $1\%$, and $10\%$ per pair, respectively.
Combining all three, the overall FAP per pair is $\sim10^{-4}$. As the number
of events, $N$, in the GW catalogs increases, the number of random pairs of
events increases as $\sim N^2$. Meanwhile, the number of lensed events will
increase linearly with $N$, implying that for sufficiently high $N$, the false
alarms will always dominate over the true lensing events. This issue can be
compensated for by placing higher thresholds on the lensing candidates (e.g.,
selecting a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold), which will lead to
better parameter estimation and, thus, lower FAP per pair -- at the cost of
dramatically decreasing the size of the lensing sample (by $\sim
1/\mbox{SNR}^3$). We show that with our simple overlap criteria for current
detectors at design sensitivity, the false alarms will dominate for realistic
lensing rates ($\lesssim10^{-3}$) even when selecting the highest SNR pairs.
These results highlight the necessity to design alternative identification
criteria beyond simple waveform and sky location overlap. Future GW detectors
Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope may provide sufficient improvement in
parameter estimation, allowing for the conclusive detection of strong lensing
of GWs.

Title:COWS: A filament finder for Hessian cosmic web identifiers,"
Abstract:  The large scale galaxy and matter distribution is often described by means of
the cosmic web made up of voids, sheets, filaments and knots. Many different
recipes exist for identifying this cosmic web. Here we focus on a sub-class of
cosmic web identifiers, based on the analysis of the Hessian matrix, and
proposed a method, called COsmic Web Skeleton (COWS), of separating a set of
filaments cells into an ensemble of individual discreet filaments.
Specifically, a thinning algorithm is applied to velocity shear tensor based
cosmic web (V-web) to identify the spine of the filaments. This results in a
set of filaments with well defined end-point and length. It is confirmed that
these sit at local density ridges and align with the appropriate direction
defined by the underlying velocity field. The radial density profile of these
curved cylindrical filaments, as well as the distribution of their lengths is
also examined. The robustness of all results is checked against resolution and
the V-web threshold. The code for the COWS method has been made publicly
available.

Title:Shocked jets in CCSNe can power the zoo of fast blue optical transients,"
Abstract:  Evidence is mounting that recent multiwavelength detections of fast blue
optical transients (FBOTs) in star-forming galaxies comprise a new class of
transients, whose origin is yet to be understood. We show that hydrogen-rich
collapsing stars that launch relativistic jets near the central engine can
naturally explain the entire set of FBOT observables. The jet-star interaction
forms a mildly-relativistic shocked jet (inner cocoon) component, which powers
cooling emission that dominates the high velocity optical signal during the
first few weeks, with a typical energy of $ \sim 10^{50}-10^{51} $ erg. During
this time, the cocoon radial energy distribution implies that the optical
lightcurve exhibits a fast decay of $ L \propto t^{-2.4} $. After a few weeks,
when the velocity of the emitting shell is $ \sim 0.01 $ c, the cocoon becomes
transparent, and the cooling envelope governs the emission. The interaction
between the cocoon and the dense circumstellar winds generates synchrotron
self-absorbed emission in the radio bands, featuring a steady rise on a month
timescale. After a few months the relativistic outflow decelerates, enters the
observer's line of sight, and powers the peak of the radio lightcurve, which
rapidly decays thereafter. The jet (and the inner cocoon) become optically thin
to X-rays $ \sim $ day after the collapse, allowing X-ray photons to diffuse
from the central engine that launched the jet to the observer. Cocoon cooling
emission is expected at higher volumetric rates than gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by
a factor of a few, similar to FBOTs. We rule out uncollimated outflows, however
both GRB jets and failed collimated jets are compatible with all observables.

Title:Weighing the Galactic disk using phase-space spirals IV. Tests on a three-dimensional galaxy simulation,"
Abstract:  In this fourth article on weighing the Galactic disk using the shape of the
phase-space spiral, we have tested our method on a billion particle
three-dimensional N-body simulation, comprised of a Milky Way like host galaxy
and a merging dwarf satellite. The main purpose of this work was to test the
validity of our model's fundamental assumptions that the spiral inhabits a
locally static and vertically separable gravitational potential. These
assumptions might be compromised in the complex kinematic system of a disturbed
three-dimensional disk galaxy; in fact, the statistical uncertainty and any
potential biases related to these assumptions are expected to be amplified for
this simulation, which differs from the Milky Way in that it is more strongly
perturbed and has a phase-space spiral that inhabits higher vertical energies.
We constructed 44 separate data samples from different spatial locations in the
simulated host galaxy. Our method produced accurate results for the vertical
gravitational potential of these 44 data samples, with an unbiased distribution
of errors with a standard deviation of 7 %. We also tested our method under
severe and unknown spatially dependent selection effects, also with robust
results; this sets it apart from traditional dynamical mass measurements that
are based on the assumption of a steady state and which are highly sensitive to
unknown or poorly modelled incompleteness. Hence, we will be able to make
localised mass measurements of distant regions in the Milky Way disk, which
would otherwise be compromised by complex and poorly understood selection
effects.

Title:Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function distances for 19 galaxies observed by PHANGS-MUSE,"
Abstract:  We provide new planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) distances to 19
nearby spiral galaxies that were observed with VLT/MUSE by the PHANGS
collaboration. Emission line ratios are used to separate planetary nebulae
(PNe) from other bright [OIII] emitting sources like compact supernovae
remnants (SNRs) or HII regions. While many studies have used narrowband imaging
for this purpose, the detailed spectral line information provided by integral
field unit (IFU) spectroscopy grants a more robust way of categorising
different [OIII] emitters. We investigate the effects of SNR contamination on
the PNLF and find that we would fail to classify all objects correctly, when
limited to the same data narrowband imaging provides. However, the few
misclassified objects usually do not fall on the bright end of the luminosity
function, and only in three cases does the distance change by more than
$1\sigma$. We find generally good agreement with literature values from other
methods. Using metallicity constraints that have also been derived from the
same IFU data, we revisit the PNLF zero point calibration. Over a range of
$8.34 < 12 + \log(\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{H}) < 8.59$, our sample is consistent with
a constant zero point and yields $M^*=-4.542^{+0.103}_{-0.059}\, \mathrm{mag}$,
within $1\sigma$ of other literature values. MUSE pushes the limits of PNLF
studies and makes galaxies beyond $20\, \mathrm{Mpc}$ accessible for this kind
of analysis. This approach to the PNLF shows great promise for leveraging
existing archival IFU data on nearby galaxies.

Title:Intrinsic alignments of the extended radio continuum emission of galaxies in the EAGLE simulations,"
Abstract:  We present measurements of the intrinsic alignments (IAs) of the star-forming
gas of galaxies in the EAGLE simulations. Radio continuum imaging of this gas
enables cosmic shear measurements complementary to optical surveys. We measure
the orientation of star-forming gas with respect to the direction to, and
orientation of, neighbouring galaxies. Star-forming gas exhibits a
preferentially radial orientation-direction alignment that is a decreasing
function of galaxy pair separation, but remains significant to $\gtrsim 1$ Mpc
at $z=0$. The alignment is qualitatively similar to that exhibited by the
stars, but is weaker at fixed separation. Pairs of galaxies hosted by more
massive subhaloes exhibit stronger alignment at fixed separation, but the
strong alignment of close pairs is dominated by ${\sim}L^\star$ galaxies and
their satellites. At fixed comoving separation, the radial alignment is
stronger at higher redshift. The orientation-orientation alignment is
consistent with random at all separations, despite subhaloes exhibiting
preferential parallel minor axis alignment. The weaker IA of star-forming gas
than for stars stems from the former's tendency to be less well aligned with
the dark matter structure of galaxies than the latter, and implies that the
systematic uncertainty due to IA may be less severe in radio continuum weak
lensing surveys than in optical counterparts. Alignment models equating the
orientation of star-forming gas discs to that of stellar discs or the DM
structure of host subhaloes will therefore overestimate the impact of IAs on
radio continuum cosmic shear measurements.

Title:First detection of a magnetic field in low-luminosity B[e] stars: New scenarios for the nature and evolutionary stages of FS CMa stars,"
Abstract:  We report the first detection of the magnetic field in a star of FS CMa type,
a subgroup of objects characterized by the B[e] phenomenon. The split of
magnetically sensitive lines in IRAS 17449+2320 determines the magnetic field
modulus of 6.2+/-0.2 kG. Spectral lines and their variability reveal the
presence of a B-type spectrum and a hot continuum source in the visible. The
hot source confirms GALEX UV photometry. Because there is a lack of spectral
lines for the hot source in the visible, the spectral fitting gives only the
lower temperature limit of the hot source, which is 50 000 K, and the upper
limit for the B-type star of 11 100 K. The V/R ratio of the H alpha line shows
quasiperiodic behavior on timescale of 800 days. We detected a strong
red-shifted absorption in the wings of Balmer and OI lines in some of the
spectra. The absorption lines of helium and other metals show no, or very
small, variations, indicating unusually stable photospheric regions for FS CMa
stars. We detected two events of material infall, which were revealed to be
discrete absorption components of resonance lines.
The discovery of the strong magnetic field together with the Gaia
measurements of the proper motion show that the most probable nature of this
star is that of a post-merger object created after the leaving the binary of
the birth cluster. Another possible scenario is a magnetic Ap star around
Terminal-Age Main Sequence (TAMS). On the other hand, the strong magnetic field
defies the hypothesis that IRAS 17449+2320 is an extreme classical Be star.
Thus, IRAS 17449+2320 provides a pretext for exploring a new explanation of the
nature of FS CMa stars or, at least, a group of stars with very similar
spectral properties.

Abstract:  At least half of a protostar's mass is accreted in the Class 0 phase, when
the central protostar is deeply embedded in a dense, infalling envelope. We
present the first systematic search for outbursts from Class 0 protostars in
the Orion clouds. Using photometry from Spitzer/IRAC spanning 2004 to 2017, we
detect three outbursts from Class 0 protostars with $\ge 2$ mag changes at 3.6
or 4.5 $\mu$m. This is comparable to the magnitude change of a known
protostellar FU Ori outburst. Two are newly detected bursts from the protostars
HOPS 12 and 124. The number of detections implies that Class 0 protostars burst
every 438 yr, with a 95% confidence interval of 161 to 1884 yr. Combining
Spitzer and WISE/NEOWISE data spanning 2004-2019, we show that the bursts
persist for more than nine years with significant variability during each
burst. Finally, we use $19-100$ $\mu$m photometry from SOFIA, Spitzer and
Herschel to measure the amplitudes of the bursts. Based on the burst interval,
a duration of 15 yr, and the range of observed amplitudes, 3-100% of the mass
accretion during the Class 0 phase occurs during bursts. In total, we show that
bursts from Class 0 protostars are as frequent, or even more frequent, than
those from more evolved protostars. This is consistent with bursts being driven
by instabilities in disks triggered by rapid mass infall. Furthermore, we find
that bursts may be a significant, if not dominant, mode of mass accretion
during the Class 0 phase.

Abstract:  We present analysis of the proper-motion (PM) field of the red clump stars in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk using the Gaia Early Data Release 3
catalog. Using a kinematic model based on old stars with 3D velocity
measurements, we construct the residual PM field by subtracting the
center-of-mass motion and internal rotation motion components. The residual PM
field reveals asymmetric patterns, including larger residual PMs in the
southern disk. Comparisons between the observed residual PM field with those of
five numerical simulations of an LMC analog that is subject to the tidal fields
of the Milky Way and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) show that the present-day
LMC is not in dynamical equilibrium. We find that both the observed level of
disk heating (PM residual root-mean-square of 0.057$\pm$0.002 mas yr$^{-1}$)
and kinematic asymmetry are not reproduced by Milky Way tides or if the SMC
impact parameter is larger than the size of the LMC disk. This measured level
of disk heating provides a novel and important method to validate numerical
simulations of the LMC-SMC interaction history. Our results alone put
constraints on an impact parameter $\lesssim$10 kpc and impact timing $<$250
Myr. When adopting the impact timing constraint of $\sim$140--160 Myr ago from
previous studies, our results suggest that the most recent SMC encounter must
have occurred with an impact parameter of $\sim$5 kpc. We also find consistent
radial trends in the kinematically- and geometrically-derived disk inclination
and line-of-node position angles, indicating a common origin.

Abstract:  We present results from deep Chandra observations of the young Type Ia
supernova remnant (SNR) 0509-68.7, also known as N103B, located in the Large
Magellanic cloud (LMC). The remnant displays an asymmetry in brightness, with
the western hemisphere appearing significantly brighter than the eastern half.
Previous multi-wavelength observations have attributed the difference to a
density gradient and suggested circumstellar material origins, drawing
similarities to Kepler's SNR. We apply a clustering technique combined with
traditional imaging analysis to spatially locate various emission components
within the remnant. We find that O and Mg emission is strongest along the blast
wave, and coincides with Spitzer observations of dust emission and optical
emission from the non-radiative shocks. The abundances of O and Mg in these
regions are enhanced relative to the average LMC abundances and appear as a
distinct spatial distribution compared to the ejecta products, supporting the
circumstellar medium (CSM) interpretation. We also find that the spatial
distribution of Cr is identical to that of Fe in the interior of the remnant,
and does not coincide at all with the O and Mg emission.

Title:The Fundamental Planes of Black Hole Activity for Radio-Loud and Radio-Quiet Quasars,"
Abstract:  We examine the fundamental plane of black hole activity for correlations with
redshift and radio loudness in both radio-loud and radio-quiet quasar
populations. Sources are compiled from archival data of both radio-loud and
radio-quiet quasars over redshifts $0.1 < z < 5.0$ to produce a sample of 353
sources with known X-ray, radio, and black hole mass measurements. A
fundamental plane of accretion activity is fit to a sample of radio-loud and
radio-quiet quasars, and we find a dichotomy between radio-loud and radio-quiet
sources. The set of best-fit equations that best describe the two samples are
$\log{L_{R}} = (1.12 \pm 0.06) \log{L_{X}} - (0.20 \pm 0.07) \log{M} -(5.64 \pm
2.99)$ for our radio-loud sample and $\log{L_{R}} = (0.48 \pm 0.06) \log{L_{X}}
+ (0.50 \pm 0.08) \log{M} + (15.26 \pm 2.66)$ for our radio-quiet sample. Our
results suggest that the average radio-quiet quasar emission is consistent with
advection dominated accretion, while a combination of jet and disc emission
dominates in radio-loud quasars. We additionally examine redshift trends
amongst the radio-loud and radio-quiet samples, and we observe a redshift
dependence for the fundamental plane of radio-loud quasars. Lastly, we utilize
the fundamental plane as a black hole mass estimation method and determine it
useful in studying systems where standard spectral modeling techniques are not
viable.

Title:Optical Photometry of WR140 as the Dust Formed During the 2016 Periastron Passage,"
Abstract:  The colliding wind binary WR140 produces dust in its shocked gas every
periastron passage. While the infrared light curve is very repeatable, there
are noticeable changes every cycle in the optical time-series photometry. In
the phases following periastron, there are optical dips in the light curve that
were postulated to be caused by localized clumps in the dust produced in our
line of sight. We report on the B and V-band light curves that were recorded by
the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) after the 2016
periastron event and briefly discuss comparisons to geometric models of the
dust production to infer that these features are likely caused by localized
dust clumps in the new dust shell.

Title:The Lensed Lyman-Alpha MUSE Arcs Sample (LLAMAS) : I. Characterisation of extended Lyman-alpha haloes and spatial offsets,"
Abstract:  We present the Lensed Lyman-Alpha MUSE Arcs Sample (LLAMAS) selected from
MUSE and HST observations of 17 lensing clusters. The sample consists of 603
continuum-faint (-23<M_UV<-14) lensed Lyman-alpha emitters (producing 959
images) with spectroscopic redshifts between 2.9 and 6.7. Combining the power
of cluster magnification with 3D spectroscopic observations, we are able to
reveal the resolved morphological properties of 268 Lyman-alpha emitters. We
use a forward modelling approach to model both Lyman-alpha and rest-frame UV
continuum emission profiles in the source plane and measure spatial extent,
ellipticity and spatial offsets between UV and Lyman-alpha emission. We find a
significant correlation between UV continuum and Lyman-alpha spatial extent.
Our characterization of the Lyman-alpha haloes indicates that the halo size is
linked to the physical properties of the host galaxy (SFR, Lyman-alpha EW and
Lyman-alpha line FWHM). We find that 48% of Lyman-alpha haloes are best-fitted
by an elliptical emission distribution with a median axis ratio of q=0.48. We
observe that 60% of galaxies detected both in UV and Lyman-alpha emission show
a significant spatial offset (Delta). We measure a median offset of Delta= 0.58
\pm 0.14 kpc for the entire sample. By comparing the spatial offset values with
the size of the UV component, we show that 40% of the offsets could be due to
star-forming sub-structures in the UV component, while the larger offsets are
more likely due to larger distance processes such as scattering effects inside
the circumgalactic medium or emission from faint satellites or merging
galaxies. Comparisons with a zoom-in radiative hydrodynamics simulation of a
typical Lyman-alpha emitting galaxy show a good agreement with LLAMAS galaxies
and indicate that bright star-formation clumps and satellite galaxies could
produce a similar spatial offsets distribution. (abridged)

Title:Combined full shape analysis of BOSS galaxies and eBOSS quasars using an iterative emulator,"
Abstract:  Standard full-shape clustering analyses in Fourier space rely on a fixed
power spectrum template, defined at the fiducial cosmology used to convert
redshifts into distances, and compress the cosmological information into the
Alcock-Paczynski parameters and the linear growth rate of structure. In this
paper, we propose an analysis method that operates directly in the cosmology
parameter space and varies the power spectrum template accordingly at each
tested point. Predictions for the power spectrum multipoles from the TNS model
are computed at different cosmologies in the framework of $\Lambda \rm{CDM}$.
Applied to the final eBOSS QSO and LRG samples together with the low-z DR12
BOSS galaxy sample, our analysis results in a set of constraints on the
cosmological parameters $\Omega_{\rm cdm}$, $H_0$, $\sigma_8$, $\Omega_{\rm b}$
and $n_s$. To reduce the number of computed models, we construct an iterative
process to sample the likelihood surface, where each iteration consists of a
Gaussian process regression. This method is validated with mocks from N-body
simulations. From the combined analysis of the (e)BOSS data, we obtain the
following constraints: $\sigma_8=0.877\pm 0.049$ and $\Omega_{\rm
m}=0.304^{+0.016}_{-0.010}$ without any external prior. The eBOSS quasar sample
alone shows a $3.1\sigma$ discrepancy compared to the Planck prediction.

Title:AGN in the ULIRG HE 0435-5304,"
Abstract:  HE 0435-5304 from Hamburg European Southern Observatory survey is a quasar
that appears in the literature with two conflicting redshift values: $\sim 1.2$
and $\sim 0.4$. It was used in the studies of the intergalactic medium through
fitting of the narrow absorption lines in its ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. This
source is also known historically as a luminous infrared galaxy. We present
optical spectra of HE 0435-5304, aiming to precisely measure its redshift and
to study its physical properties. In particular, properties of its active
nucleus, which is studied in the context of the source being identified here as
an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy, allow us to place this quasar in the context
of the general population. Fitting the spectra, we focused on modeling H$\beta$
and [O III] lines. Based on these, we derived the virial black hole mass,
bolometric luminosity, and Eddington ratio of the active galactic nucleus
(AGN). Additionally, we performed broad band photometry fitting which allows us
to quantify host galaxy parameters. The improved redshift value of HE 0435-5304
is estimated to $0.42788 \pm 0.00027$ based on the [O II] line, which is mostly
consistent with the narrowest components of the other emission lines. The
source was found to be a relatively massive and luminous AGN whose host galaxy
is actively forming stars. Although its stellar population seems to be heavily
obscured, we did not find evidence for significant obscuration of the nucleus.
We conclude that the AGN HE 0435-5304 is a rather prominent iron emitter from
the extreme type-A population very close to the narrow-line Seyfert 1 group.
The fact that the width of the H$\beta$ line appears to be systematically
growing in its broadest component with time may suggest that this AGN is
changing its broad line region. Due to the influence of atmospheric effects,
this finding is uncertain.

"Title:Comparison between core-collapse supernova nucleosynthesis and meteoric stardust grains: investigating magnesium, aluminium, and chromium","
Abstract:  Isotope variations of nucleosynthetic origin among Solar System's solid
samples are well documented, yet the origin of these variations is still
uncertain. The observed variability of \iso{54}Cr among materials formed in
different regions of the proto-planetary disk has been attributed to variable
amounts of presolar chromium-rich oxide (chromite) grains, which exist within
the meteoritic stardust inventory and most likely originated from some type of
supernova explosions. To investigate if core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) could
be the site of origin of these grains, we analyse yields of CCSN models of
stars with initial mass 15, 20 and 25 M$_{\odot}$, and solar metallicity. We
present an extensive abundance data set of the Cr, Mg, and Al isotopes as a
function of enclosed mass. We find cases in which the explosive C-ashes produce
a composition in good agreement with the observed \iso{54}Cr/\iso{52}Cr and
\iso{53}Cr/\iso{52}Cr ratios as well as the \iso{50}Cr/\iso{52}Cr ratios.
Taking into account that the signal at atomic mass 50 could also originate from
\iso{50}Ti, the ashes of explosive He-burning also match the observed ratios.
Addition of material from the He ashes (enriched in Al and Cr relative to Mg to
simulate the make-up of chromite grains) to the Solar System composition may
reproduce the observed correlation between Mg and Cr anomalies, while material
from the C-ashes does not present significant Mg anomalies together with Cr
isotopic variations. In all cases, non-radiogenic, stable Mg isotope variations
dominate over the variations expected from \iso{26}Al.

Title:The synchrotron mechanism and the high energy flair from PKS 1510-089,"
Abstract:  In order to understand the role of the synchrotron emission in the high
energy gamma-ray flares from PKS 1510-089, we study generation of the
synchrotron emission by means of the feedback of cyclotron waves on the
particle distribution via the diffusion process. The cyclotron resonance causes
the diffusion of particles along and across the magnetic field lines. This
process is described by the quasi-linear diffusion (QLD) that leads to the
increase of pitch angles and generation of the synchrotron emission. We study
the kinetic equation which defines the distribution of emitting particles. The
redistribution is conditioned by two major factors, QLD and the dissipation
process, that is caused by synchrotron reaction force. The QLD increases pitch
angles, whereas the synchrotron force resists this process. The balance between
these two forces guarantees the maintenance of the pitch angles and the
corresponding synchrotron emission process. The model is analyzed for a wide
range of physical parameters and it is shown that the mechanism of QLD provides
the generation of high energy (HE) emission in the GeV energy domain. According
to the model the lower energy, associated with the cyclotron modes, provokes
the synchrotron radiation in the higher energy band.

"Title:Let the Great World Spin: Revealing the Stormy, Turbulent Nature of Young Giant Exoplanet Analogs with the Spitzer Space Telescope","
Abstract:  We present a survey for photometric variability in young, low-mass brown
dwarfs with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The 23 objects in our sample show
robust signatures of youth and share properties with directly-imaged
exoplanets. We present three new young objects: 2MASS J03492367$+$0635078,
2MASS J09512690 $-$8023553 and 2MASS J07180871$-$6415310. We detect variability
in 13 young objects, and find that young brown dwarfs are highly likely to
display variability across the L2--T4 spectral type range. In contrast, the
field dwarf variability occurrence rate drops for spectral types $>$L9. We
examine the variability amplitudes of young objects and find an enhancement in
maximum amplitudes compared to field dwarfs. We speculate that the observed
range of amplitudes within a spectral type may be influenced by secondary
effects such as viewing inclination and/or rotation period. We combine our new
rotation periods with the literature to investigate the effects of mass on
angular momentum evolution. While high mass brown dwarfs ($>30
M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$) spin up over time, the same trend is not apparent for lower
mass objects ($<30 M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$), likely due to the small number of
measured periods for old, low-mass objects. The rotation periods of companion
brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects are consistent with those of isolated
objects with similar ages and masses, suggesting similar angular momentum
histories. Within the AB Doradus group, we find a high variability occurrence
rate and evidence for common angular momentum evolution. The results are
encouraging for future variability searches in directly-imaged exoplanets with
facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope and 30-meter telescopes.

Title:Partial-Attribution Instance Segmentation for Astronomical Source Detection and Deblending,"
Abstract:  Astronomical source deblending is the process of separating the contribution
of individual stars or galaxies (sources) to an image comprised of multiple,
possibly overlapping sources. Astronomical sources display a wide range of
sizes and brightnesses and may show substantial overlap in images. Astronomical
imaging data can further challenge off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms
owing to its high dynamic range, low signal-to-noise ratio, and unconventional
image format. These challenges make source deblending an open area of
astronomical research, and in this work, we introduce a new approach called
Partial-Attribution Instance Segmentation that enables source detection and
deblending in a manner tractable for deep learning models. We provide a novel
neural network implementation as a demonstration of the method.

Title:3D magnetic field morphology of the Perseus molecular cloud,"
Abstract:  Despite recent observational and theoretical advances in mapping the magnetic
fields associated with molecular clouds, their three-dimensional (3D)
morphology remains unresolved. Multi-wavelength and multi-scale observations
will allow us to paint a comprehensive picture of the magnetic fields of these
star-forming regions. We reconstruct the 3D magnetic field morphology
associated with the Perseus molecular cloud and compare it with predictions of
cloud-formation models. These cloud-formation models predict a bending of
magnetic fields associated with filamentary molecular clouds. We compare the
orientation and direction of this field bending with our 3D magnetic field view
of the Perseus cloud. We use previous line-of-sight and plane-of-sky magnetic
field observations, as well as Galactic magnetic field models, to reconstruct
the complete 3D magnetic field vectors and morphology associated with the
Perseus cloud. We approximate the 3D magnetic field morphology of the cloud as
a concave arc that points in the decreasing longitude direction in the plane of
the sky (from our point of view). This field morphology preserves a memory of
the Galactic magnetic field. In order to compare this morphology to
cloud-formation model predictions, we assume that the cloud retains a memory of
its most recent interaction. Incorporating velocity observations, we find that
the line-of-sight magnetic field observations are consistent with predictions
of shock-cloud-interaction models. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that the 3D magnetic fields of a molecular cloud have been reconstructed. We
find the 3D magnetic field morphology of the Perseus cloud to be consistent
with the predictions of the shock-cloud-interaction model, which describes the
formation mechanism of filamentary molecular clouds.

Title:Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy: history and development of techniques,"
Abstract:  Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays constitute one of the main pillars of high
energy astrophysics. Gamma rays are produced under extreme relativistic
conditions in the Universe. VHE gamma$ rays can be detected indirectly on the
ground. Detection of these energetic photons poses several technological
challenges. Firstly, even though gamma rays are highly penetrative, the Earth's
atmosphere is opaque to them. Secondly, these gamma rays are to be detected
against the overwhelming background of cosmic rays. When a VHE gamma ray
arrives at the top of the atmosphere it produces charged secondaries. These
charged particles produce Cherenkov flashes in the optical band. Even though
the first attempts to detect these Cherenkov flashes were made almost 70 years
ago, it took several decades of relentless efforts to streamline the technique.
Ground-based VHE gamma-ray astronomy has now established itself as one of the
crucial branches of conventional high energy astronomy to study the
relativistic Universe. In this article we look back and present a historical
perspective followed by a discussion on the current status and finally what
lies ahead.

Title:Study of changes in the pulsation period of 148 Galactic Cepheid variables,"
Abstract:  Investigating period changes of classical Cepheids through the framework of
$O-C$ diagrams provides a unique insight to the evolution and nature of these
variable stars. In this work, the new or extended $O-C$ diagrams for 148
Galactic classical Cepheids are presented. By correlating the calculated period
change rates with the Gaia EDR3 colours, we obtain observational indications
for the non-negligible dependence of the period change rate on the horizontal
position within the instability strip. We find period fluctuations in 59
Cepheids with a confidence level of 99%, which are distributed uniformly over
the inspected period range. Correlating the fluctuation amplitude with the
pulsation period yields a clear dependence, similar to the one valid for longer
period pulsating variable stars. The non-negligible amount of Cepheids showing
changes in their $O-C$ diagrams that are not or not only of evolutionary origin
points toward the need for further studies for the complete understanding of
these effects. One such peculiar behaviour is the large amplitude period
fluctuation in short period Cepheids, which occurs in a significant fraction of
the investigated stars. The period dependence of the fluctuation strength and
its minimum at the bump Cepheid region suggests a stability enhancing mechanism
for this period range, which agrees with current pulsation models.

Title:FGC 1287 and its enigmatic 250 kpc long HI tail in the outskirts of Abell 1367,"
Abstract:  We present HI and radio continuum, narrow-band H$\alpha$ imaging, IFU
spectroscopy, and X-ray observations of the FGC 1287 triplet projected $\sim$
1.8 Mpc west of the galaxy cluster Abell 1367. One triplet member, FGC 1287,
displays an exceptionally long, 250 kpc HI tail and an unperturbed stellar disk
which are the typical signatures of ram pressure stripping (RPS). To generate
detectable RPS signatures the presence of an Intra-cluster medium
(ICM)/intra-group medium (IGM) with sufficient density to produce RPS at a
realistic velocity relative to the ICM/IGM is a prerequisite. However,
XMM-Newton observations were not able to detect X-ray emission from the
triplet, implying that if a hot ICM/IGM is present, its density, n${_e}$, is
less than 2.6 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$. Higher-resolution VLA HI data
presented here show FGC 1287's HI disk is truncated and significantly warped
whereas the HI tail is clumpy. TNG H$\alpha$ imaging identified three star
forming clumps projected within 20 kpc of FGC 1287's disk, with VIMOS-IFU data
confirming two of these are counterparts to HI clumps in the tail. The
triplet's HI kinematics, together with H$\alpha$ and radio continuum imaging
suggests an interaction may have enhanced star formation in FGC 1287's disk,
but cannot readily account for the origin of the long HI tail. We consider
several scenarios which might reconcile RPS with the non-detection of ICM/IGM
X-ray emission but none of these unambiguously explains the origin of the long
HI tail.

time-series photometric ground-based data are collected during 150 days from
the highest plateau of Antarctica. PAIX light curve analyses reveal an even
richer power spectrum with mixed modes in RR Lyrae stars. A nonlinear nature of
several dominant peaks, showing lower and higher frequencies, occur around the
dominant fundamental radial pressure mode. These lower frequencies and
harmonics linearly interact with the dominant fundamental radial pressure mode
and its second and third overtone pressure modes as well. Half-integer
frequencies are also detected, likewise side peak structures demonstrating that
HH puppis is a bona-fide Blazhko star. Fourier correlations are used to derive
underlying physical characteristics for HH puppis. The most striking finding is
the direct detection of gravity waves. We interpret the excitation mechanism of
gravity waves in RR Lyrae stars by the penetrative convection driving
mechanism. We demonstrate that RR Lyrae stars pulsation is excited by several
distinct mechanisms, and hence RR Lyrae stars are simultaneously g modes and p
modes pulsators. Our discoveries make RR Lyrae stars very challenging stellar
objects, and provide their potential to undergo at the same time g modes and p
modes towards an advancement of theory of stellar evolution and a better

ranging from $\sim 6$ to $\sim 100$ $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. We performed a

a group, namely: A 3562 and the group SC 1329--313. It is morphologically
similar to the X-ray emission in the region. We also found (1) a radio tail

bar; (3) ultrasteep diffuse emission at the centre of A 3558. Finally (4), we

Title:Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE): IV. Ideal kernel-nulling array architectures for a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer,"
Abstract:  Aims: Optical interferometry from space for the purpose of detecting and
characterising exoplanets is seeing a revival, specifically from missions such
as the proposed Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). A default
assumption since the design studies of Darwin and TPF-I has been that the Emma
X-array configuration is the optimal architecture for this goal. Here, we
examine whether new advances in the field of nulling interferometry, such as
the concept of kernel nulling, challenge this assumption.
Methods: We develop a tool designed to derive the photon-limited signal to
noise ratio of a large sample of simulated planets for different architecture
configurations and beam combination schemes. We simulate four basic
configurations: the double Bracewell/X-array, and kernel nullers with three,
four and five telescopes respectively.
Results: We find that a configuration of five telescopes in a pentagonal
shape, using a five aperture kernel nulling scheme, outperforms the X-array
design in both search (finding more planets) and characterisation (obtaining
better signal, faster) when total collecting area is conserved. This is
especially the case when trying to detect Earth twins (temperate, rocky planets
in the habitable zone), showing a 23% yield increase over the X-array. On
average, we find that a five telescope design receives 1.2 times the signal
over the X-array design.
Conclusions: With the results of this simulation, we conclude that the Emma
X-array configuration may not be the best architecture choice for the upcoming
LIFE mission, and that a five telescope design utilising kernel nulling
concepts will likely provide better scientific return for the same collecting
area, provided that technical solutions for the required achromatic phase
shifts can be implemented.

Title:Dark radiation constraints on light primordial black holes,"
Abstract:  Light black holes could have formed in the very early universe through the
collapse of large primordial density fluctuations. These primordial black holes
(PBHs), if light enough, would have evaporated by now because of the emission
of Hawking radiation; thus they could not represent a sizable fraction of dark
matter today. However, they could have left imprints in the early cosmological
epochs. We will discuss the impact of massless graviton emission by (rotating)
PBHs before the onset of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and conclude that this
contribution to dark radiation is constrained by the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) (with the future CMB Stage 4) and BBN in the lighter portion
of the PBH mass range, under the hypothesis that they dominated the energy
density of the universe.

Title:Small-scale magnetic fields of the spectroscopic binary T Tauri stars V1878 Ori and V4046 Sir,"
Abstract:  Aims. The goal of this study is to investigate the small-scale magnetic
fields of the two spectroscopic binary T Tauri stars V1878 Ori and V4046 Sgr.
This is done to complete the observational characterisation of the surface
magnetic fields of these stars because only their large-scale magnetic fields
have been studied with Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) so far. Methods. To
investigate the small-scale magnetic fields, the differential Zeeman
intensification of near-infrared Ti I lines was investigated using
high-resolution archival spectra obtained with the ESPaDOnS spectrograph at the
CFHT. In order to study the binary components separately, the spectra were
disentangled by considering observations taken at different orbital phases. The
Zeeman-intensification analysis was performed based on detailed polarised
radiative transfer calculations aided by the Markov chain Monte Carlo
inference, treating magnetic field filling factors and other stellar parameters
that could affect the spectra as free parameters. Results. The obtained average
magnetic field strengths of the components of V1878 Ori are 1.33 and 1.57 kG,
respectively. Previous ZDI studies of V1878 Ori recovered about 14 and 20% of
this magnetic field strength. For V4046 Sgr, the magnetic field strengths are
1.96 and 1.83 kG, respectively. In this case, about 12 and 9% of the total
magnetic field strength was detected by ZDI. Conclusions. The small-scale
magnetic field strengths obtained from Zeeman intensification are similar for
the two components of each binary. This is in contrast to the large-scale
magnetic fields obtained from ZDI investigations, performed using the same
observations. While the large-scale field might look significantly different.
This indicates that the efficiency of the magnetic dynamo is comparable for the
components of the two binaries, because most energy is carreid by the small
scale fields.

isotropic universe, we reconstruct the dark energy density directly from
observational data and investigate its evolution through cosmic history. We
consider the latest SNIa, BAO and cosmic chronometer data and reconstruct the
dark energy density in both flat and non-flat universes up to redshift $z\sim
3$. The results are well in agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM up to redshift
$z\sim 1.5$, whereas all data and methods, in our analysis, provide a negative
dark energy density at high redshifts.

Title:B-fields in Star-Forming Region Observations (BISTRO): Magnetic Fields in the Filamentary Structures of Serpens Main,"
Abstract:  We present 850 $\mu$m polarimetric observations toward the Serpens Main
molecular cloud obtained using the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope (JCMT) as part of the B-fields In STar-forming Region Observations
(BISTRO) survey. These observations probe the magnetic field morphology of the
Serpens Main molecular cloud on about 6000 au scales, which consists of cores
and six filaments with different physical properties such as density and star
formation activity. Using the histogram of relative orientation (HRO)
technique, we find that magnetic fields are parallel to filaments in less dense
filamentary structures where $N_{H_2} < 0.93\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ (magnetic
fields perpendicular to density gradients), while being perpendicular to
filaments (magnetic fields parallel to density gradients) in dense filamentary
structures with star formation activity. Moreover, applying the HRO technique
to denser core regions, we find that magnetic field orientations change to
become perpendicular to density gradients again at $N_{H_2} \approx 4.6 \times
10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. This can be interpreted as a signature of core formation.
At $N_{H_2} \approx 16 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ magnetic fields change back to
being parallel to density gradients once again, which can be understood to be
due to magnetic fields being dragged in by infalling material. In addition, we
estimate the magnetic field strengths of the filaments ($B_{POS} =
60-300~\mu$G)) using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method and discuss whether
the filaments are gravitationally unstable based on magnetic field and
turbulence energy densities.

Title:Is magnetically dominated outflow required to explain GRBs?,"
Abstract:  The composition of relativistic outflows producing gamma-ray bursts is a long
standing open question. One of the main arguments in favor of magnetically
dominated outflows is the absence of photospheric component in their broadband
time resolved spectra, with such notable example as GRB 080916C. Here, we
perform a time-resolved analysis of this burst and confirm the previous
detection of an additional spectral component. We show that this subdominant
component is consistent with the photosphere of ultrarelativistic baryonic
outflow, deep in the coasting regime. We argue that, contrary to previous
statements, the magnetic dominance of the outflow is not required for the
interpretation of this GRB. Moreover, simultaneous detection of high energy
emission in its prompt phase requires departure from a one-zone emission model.

Title:Feeding the spider with carbon -- [CII] emission from the circum galactic medium and active galactic nucleus,"
Abstract:  We present the detection of [CII] 158um emission from the Spiderweb galaxy at
z=2.1612 using the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment. The line profile splits into
an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and circum galacic medium (CGM) component
previously identified in CO and [CI]. We find that these individual [CII]
components are consistent in terms of CO and far-IR luminosity ratios with the
populations of other z>~1 AGN and dusty star-forming galaxies. The CGM
component dominates the [CII] emission in the 10"" APEX beam. Although we do not
have spatially resolved data, the close correspondence of the velocity profile
with the CO(1-0) detected only on scales of tens of kiloparsecs in CO(1-0)
suggests that the [CII] emission is similarly extended, reminiscent of [CII]
halos recently found around z>5 galaxies. Comparing the first four ionization
states of carbon, we find that the atomic [CI] emission is dominant, which
increases its reliability as a molecular mass tracer. Our [CII] detection at
601.8 GHz also demonstrates the feasibility to extend the frequency range of
ALMA Band 9 beyond the original specifications.

Title:Probing the circumgalactic medium with CMB polarization statistical anisotropy,"
Abstract:  As cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons traverse the Universe,
anisotropies can be induced via Thomson scattering (proportional to the
integrated electron density; optical depth) and inverse Compton scattering
(proportional to the integrated electron pressure; thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect). Measurements of anisotropy in optical depth $\tau$ and Compton $y$
parameter are imprinted by the galaxies and galaxy clusters and are thus
sensitive to the thermodynamic properties of circumgalactic medium and
intergalactic medium. We use an analytic halo model to predict the power
spectrum of the optical depth ($\tau\tau$), the cross-correlation between the
optical depth and the Compton $y$ parameter ($\tau y$), as well as the
cross-correlation between the optical depth and galaxy clustering ($\tau g$),
and compare this model to cosmological simulations. We constrain the optical
depths of halos at $z\lesssim 3$ using a technique originally devised to
constrain patchy reionization at a much higher redshift range. The forecasted
signal-to-noise ratio is 2.6, 8.5, and 13, respectively, for a CMB-S4-like
experiment and a VRO-like optical survey. We show that a joint analysis of
these probes can constrain the amplitude of the density profiles of halos to
6.5% and the pressure profile to 13%, marginalizing over the outer slope of the
pressure profile. These constraints translate to astrophysical parameters
related to the physics of galaxy evolution, such as the gas mass fraction,
$f_{\rm g}$, which can be constrained to 5.3% uncertainty at $z\sim 0$,
assuming an underlying model for the shape of the density profile. The
cross-correlations presented here are complementary to other CMB and galaxy
cross-correlations since they do not require spectroscopic galaxy redshifts and
are another example of how such correlations are a powerful probe of the
astrophysics of galaxy evolution.

Title:A search for ionised gas outflows in an Halpha imaging atlas of nearby LINERs,"
Abstract:  Outflows play a major role in the evolution of galaxies. However, we do not
have yet a complete picture of their properties (extension, geometry,
orientation and clumpiness). For low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs),
in particular, low-ionisation nuclear emission line regions (LINERs), the rate
of outflows and their properties are largely unknown. The main goal of this
work is to create the largest, up-to-date atlas of ionised gas outflow
candidates in a sample of 70 nearby LINERs. We use narrow-band, imaging data to
analyse the morphological properties of the ionised gas nuclear emission of
these galaxies and to identify signatures of extended emission with distinctive
outflow-like morphologies. We obtained new imaging data from ALFOSC/NOT for 32
LINERs. We complemented it with HST archival data for 6 objects and with
results from the literature for other 32 targets. We additionally obtained soft
X-ray data from Chandra archive to compare with the ionised gas. The
distribution of the ionised gas in these LINER shows that $\sim$32% have
bubble-like emission, $\sim$28% show a 'Core-halo', unresolved emission, and
$\sim$21% have a disky-like distribution. Dust lanes prevent a detailed
classification for $\sim$11% of the sample ('Dusty'). If we account for the
kinematical information, available for 60 galaxies, we end up with 48% of the
LINERs with detected outflows/inflows (50% considering only kinematical
information based on Integral Field Spectroscopy). Our results suggest that the
incidence of outflows in LINERs may vary from 41% up to 56%, based on both the
Halpha morphology and the kinematical information from the literature. The
ionised gas is co-spatial with the soft X-ray emission for the majority of
cases ($\sim$60%), so that they may have a common origin. We discuss the use of
Halpha imaging for the pre-selection of candidates likely hosting ionised gas
outflows.

Title:Martian Dust Storms and Gravity Waves: Disentangling Water Transport to the Upper Atmosphere,"
Abstract:  Simulations with the Max Planck Institute Martian general circulation model
for Martian years 28 and 34 reveal details of the water ""pump"" mechanism and
the role of gravity wave (GW) forcing. Water is advected to the upper
atmosphere mainly by upward branches of the meridional circulation: in low
latitudes during equinoxes and over the south pole during solstices. Molecular
diffusion plays little role in water transport in the middle atmosphere and
across the mesopause. GWs modulate the circulation and temperature during
global dust storms, thus changing the timing and intensity of the transport. At
equinoxes, they facilitate water accumulation in the polar warming regions in
the middle atmosphere followed by stronger upwelling over the equator. As
equinoctial storms decay, GWs tend to accelerate the reduction of water in the
thermosphere. GWs delay the onset of the transport during solstitial storms and
change the globally averaged amount of water in the upper atmosphere by 10-25%.

Title:Modeling the hydrological cycle in the atmosphere of Mars: Influence of a bimodal size distribution of aerosol nucleation particles,"
Abstract:  We present a new implementation of the hydrological cycle scheme into a
general circulation model of the Martian atmosphere. The model includes a
semi-Lagrangian transport scheme for water vapor and ice, and accounts for
microphysics of phase transitions between them. The hydrological scheme
includes processes of saturation, nucleation, particle growth, sublimation and
sedimentation under the assumption of a variable size distribution. The scheme
has been implemented into the Max Planck Institute Martian general circulation
model (MPI--MGCM) and tested assuming mono- and bimodal log-normal
distributions of ice condensation nuclei. We present a comparison of the
simulated annual variations, horizontal and vertical distributions of water
vapor and ice clouds with the available observations from instruments onboard
Mars orbiters. The accounting for bi-modality of aerosol particle distribution
improves the simulations of the annual hydrological cycle, including predicted
ice clouds mass, opacity, number density, particle radii. The increased number
density and lower nucleation rates brings the simulated cloud opacities closer
to observations. Simulations show a weak effect of the excess of small aerosol
particles on the simulated water vapor distributions.

Title:Insights into the evolution of five isolated galaxies,"
Abstract:  The galaxy evolution is believed to be conditioned by the environment.
Isolated galaxies or galaxies in poor groups are an excellent laboratory to
study evolutionary mechanisms where effects of the environment are minimal. We
present new {\it Swift}-{\tt UVOT} data in six filters, three in the
ultraviolet (UV), of five isolated galaxies aiming at shedding light into their
evolution. For all of our targets we present new UV integrated fluxes and for
some of them also new UBV magnitudes. Our observations allow us to improve
their multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions extending it over about 3
orders of magnitude in wavelength. We exploit our smooth-particle
hydro-dynamical simulations with chemo-photometric implementation anchored, a
posteriori, to the global multi-wavelength properties of our targets, to give
insight into their evolution. Then we compare their evolutionary properties
with those previously derived for several galaxies in groups. The evolution of
our targets is driven by a merger occurred several Gyrs ago, in the redshift
range $0.5\leq z \leq 4.5$, not unlike what we have already found for galaxies
in groups. The merger shapes the potential well where the gas is accreting
driving the star formation rate and the galaxy evolution. Isolated galaxies
should not have suffered from interactions for at least 3\,Gyr. However, the
initial merger is still leaving its signatures on the properties of our
targets. Several rejuvenation episodes, triggered by {\it in situ} accretion,
are highlighted. Moreover, jelly-fish morphologies appear as these galaxies
achieve their maximum star formation rate, before their quenching phase.

Title:Comments on the mass sheet degeneracy in cosmography analyses,"
Abstract:  We make a number of comments regarding modeling degeneracies in strong
lensing measurements of the Hubble parameter $H_0$. The first point concerns
the impact of weak lensing associated with different segments of the line of
sight. We show that external convergence terms associated with the lens-source
and observer-lens segments need to be included in cosmographic modeling, in
addition to the usual observer-source term, to avoid systematic bias in the
inferred value of $H_0$. Specifically, we show how an incomplete account of
some line of sight terms biases stellar kinematics as well as ray tracing
simulation methods to alleviate the mass sheet degeneracy. The second point
concerns the use of imaging data for multiple strongly-lensed sources in a
given system. We show that the mass sheet degeneracy is not fully resolved by
the availability of multiple sources: some degeneracy remains because of
differential external convergence between the different sources. Similarly,
differential external convergence also complicates the use of multiple sources
in addressing the approximate mass sheet degeneracy associated with a local
(""internal"") core component in lens galaxies. This internal-external degeneracy
is amplified by the non-monotonicity of the angular diameter distance as a
function of redshift. For a rough assessment of the weak lensing effects, we
provide estimates of external convergence using the nonlinear matter power
spectrum, paying attention to non-equal time correlators.

Title:PDRs4All: A JWST Early Release Science Program on radiative feedback from massive stars,"
Abstract:  Massive stars disrupt their natal molecular cloud material through radiative
and mechanical feedback processes. These processes have profound effects on the
evolution of interstellar matter in our Galaxy and throughout the Universe,
from the era of vigorous star formation at redshifts of 1-3 to the present day.
The dominant feedback processes can be probed by observations of the
Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs) where the far-ultraviolet photons of massive
stars create warm regions of gas and dust in the neutral atomic and molecular
gas. PDR emission provides a unique tool to study in detail the physical and
chemical processes that are relevant for most of the mass in inter- and
circumstellar media including diffuse clouds, proto-planetary disks and
molecular cloud surfaces, globules, planetary nebulae, and star-forming
regions. PDR emission dominates the infrared (IR) spectra of star-forming
galaxies. Most of the Galactic and extragalactic observations obtained with the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will therefore arise in PDR emission. In this
paper we present an Early Release Science program using the MIRI, NIRSpec, and
NIRCam instruments dedicated to the observations of an emblematic and nearby
PDR: the Orion Bar. These early JWST observations will provide template
datasets designed to identify key PDR characteristics in JWST observations.
These data will serve to benchmark PDR models and extend them into the JWST
era. We also present the Science-Enabling products that we will provide to the
community. These template datasets and Science-Enabling products will guide the
preparation of future proposals on star-forming regions in our Galaxy and
beyond and will facilitate data analysis and interpretation of forthcoming JWST
observations.

Title:Star formation near the Sun is driven by expansion of the Local Bubble,"
Abstract:  For decades we have known that the Sun lies within the Local Bubble, a cavity
of low-density, high-temperature plasma surrounded by a shell of cold, neutral
gas and dust. However, the precise shape and extent of this shell, the impetus
and timescale for its formation, and its relationship to nearby star formation
have remained uncertain, largely due to low-resolution models of the local
interstellar medium. Leveraging new spatial and dynamical constraints from the
Gaia space mission, here we report an analysis of the 3D positions, shapes, and
motions of dense gas and young stars within 200 pc of the Sun. We find that
nearly all the star-forming complexes in the solar vicinity lie on the surface
of the Local Bubble and that their young stars show outward expansion mainly
perpendicular to the bubble's surface. Tracebacks of these young stars' motions
support a scenario where the origin of the Local Bubble was a burst of stellar
birth and then death (supernovae) taking place near the bubble's center
beginning 14 Myr ago. The expansion of the Local Bubble created by the
supernovae swept up the ambient interstellar medium into an extended shell that
has now fragmented and collapsed into the most prominent nearby molecular
clouds, in turn providing robust observational support for the theory of
supernova-driven star formation.

"Title:Fully Adaptive Bayesian Algorithm for Data Analysis, FABADA","
Abstract:  The aim of this paper is to describe a novel non-parametric noise reduction
technique from the point of view of Bayesian inference that may automatically
improve the signal-to-noise ratio of one- and two-dimensional data, such as
e.g. astronomical images and spectra. The algorithm iteratively evaluates
possible smoothed versions of the data, the smooth models, obtaining an
estimation of the underlying signal that is statistically compatible with the
noisy measurements. Iterations stop based on the evidence and the $\chi^2$
statistic of the last smooth model, and we compute the expected value of the
signal as a weighted average of the whole set of smooth models. In this paper,
we explain the mathematical formalism and numerical implementation of the
algorithm, and we evaluate its performance in terms of the peak signal to noise
ratio, the structural similarity index, and the time payload, using a battery
of real astronomical observations. Our Fully Adaptive Bayesian Algorithm for
Data Analysis (FABADA) yields results that, without any parameter tuning, are
comparable to standard image processing algorithms whose parameters have been
optimized based on the true signal to be recovered, something that is
impossible in a real application. State-of-the-art non-parametric methods, such
as BM3D, offer slightly better performance at high signal-to-noise ratio, while
our algorithm is significantly more accurate for extremely noisy data (higher
than $20-40\%$ relative errors, a situation of particular interest in the field
of astronomy). In this range, the standard deviation of the residuals obtained
by our reconstruction may become more than an order of magnitude lower than
that of the original measurements. The source code needed to reproduce all the
results presented in this report, including the implementation of the method,

Abstract:  The identification of binary stars of different mass ratios in resolved

constructed with the pseudo-colors (H-W2)-W1 vs W2-(BP-K) can be employed to
estimate the binary and multiple star ratios and the distribution of their
component mass ratio $q$ effectively. As an application, we investigate the
Pleiades star cluster in the range of primary component mass between 0.5 and
1.8 $M_{\odot}$. The binary star ratio is found to be between 0.54$\pm$0.11 and
0.70$\pm$0.14. On the other hand, the ratio of systems with multiplicity more
than 2 is between 0.10$\pm$0.00 and 0.14$\pm$0.01. The distribution of the
component mass ratio $q$ has been approximated by a power law with the exponent
between -0.53$\pm$0.10 and -0.63$\pm$0.22. Below 0.5 $M_{\odot}$, we expect a
large number of brown dwarfs among secondary components.

Title:FRAMEx II: Simultaneous X-ray and Radio Variability in Active Galactic Nuclei $-$ The Case of NGC 2992,"
Abstract:  Using simultaneous Very Long Baseline Array and Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory X-ray Telescope observations of the active galactic nucleus (AGN)
in NGC 2992 over a six-month observing campaign, we observed a large drop in
core 5 cm radio luminosity, by a factor of $>3$, in tandem with factor of $>5$
increase in $2-10$ keV X-ray luminosity. While NGC 2992 has long been an
important object for studies of X-ray variability, our study is the first
simultaneous X-ray and radio variability campaign on this object. We observe
that the X-ray spectral index does not change over the course of the flare,
consistent with a change in the bulk amount of Comptonizing plasma, potentially
due to a magnetic reconnection event in the accretion disk. The drop in
apparent radio luminosity can be explained by a change in free-free absorption,
which we calculate to correspond to an ionized region with physical extent and
electron density consistent with the broad line region (BLR). Our results are
consistent with magnetic reconnection events in the dynamic accretion disk
creating outbursts of ionizing material, increasing Compton up-scattering of UV
accretion disk photons and feeding material into the BLR. These findings
present an important physical picture for the dynamical relationship between
X-ray and radio emission in AGNs.

Title:The cycle of metals in the infalling elliptical galaxy NGC 1404,"
Abstract:  Hot atmospheres pervading galaxy clusters, groups, and early-type galaxies
are rich in metals, produced during epochs and diffused via processes that are
still to be determined. While this enrichment has been routinely investigated
in clusters, metals in lower mass systems are more challenging to probe with
standard X-ray exposures and spectroscopy. In this paper, we focus on very deep
XMM-Newton ($\sim$350 ks) observations of NGC 1404, a massive elliptical galaxy
experiencing ram-pressure stripping of its hot atmosphere while infalling
toward the centre of the Fornax cluster, with the aim to derive abundances
through its hot gas extent. Importantly, we report the existence of a new
fitting bias - the ""double Fe bias"" - leading to an underestimate of the Fe
abundance when two thermal components cannot realistically model the complex
temperature structure present in the outer atmosphere of the galaxy.
Contrasting with the ''metal conundrum'' seen in clusters, the Fe and Mg masses
of NGC 1404 are measured 1-2 orders of magnitude below what stars and
supernovae could have reasonably produced and released. In addition, we note
the remarkable Solar abundance ratios of the galaxy's halo, different from its
stellar counterpart but similar to the chemical composition of the ICM of rich
clusters. Completing the clusters regime, all these findings provide additional
support toward a scenario of early enrichment, at play over two orders of
magnitude in mass. A few peculiar and intriguing features, such as a possible
double metal peak as well as an apparent ring of enhanced Si near the galaxy
core, are also discussed.

Title:Numerical simulations of bar formation in the Local Group,"
Abstract:  More than 50 per cent of present-day massive disc galaxies show a rotating
stellar bar. Their formation and dynamics have been widely studied both
numerically and observationally. Although numerical simulations in the
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework predict the formation of such stellar
components, there seems to be a tension between theoretical and observational
results. Simulated bars are typically larger in size and have slower pattern
speed than observed ones. We study the formation and evolution of barred
galaxies, using two $\Lambda$CDM zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations of the
CLUES project that follow the evolution of a cosmological Local Group-like
volume. We found that our simulated bars, at $z = 0$, are both shorter and
faster rotators than previous ones found in other studies on cosmological
simulations alleviating the tension mentioned above. These bars match the short
tail-end of the observed bar length distribution. In agreement with previous
numerical works, we find that bars form in those systems where the disc
self-gravity is dominant over the dark matter halo, making them unstable
against bar formation. Our bars developed in the last 3-4 Gyr until they
achieve their current length and strength; as bars grow, their lengths increase
while their rotation speeds decrease. Despite this slowdown, at redshift $z =
0$ their rotation speeds and size match well the observational data.

Abstract:  We present the CO isotopologue Line Atlas within the Whirpool galaxy Survey
(CLAWS) based on an IRAM 30-m large programme which provides a benchmark study
of numerous, faint CO isotopologues in the mm-wavelength regime across the full
disc of M51 (NGC 5194). The survey's core goal is to use the low-J CO
isotopologue lines to constrain CO excitation and chemistry, and therefrom the
local physical conditions of the gas. In this survey paper, we describe the
CLAWS observing and data reduction strategies. We map the J=1-0 and 2-1
transitions of the CO isotopologues $^{12}$CO,$^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O and
C$^{17}$O, as well as several supplementary lines within the 1 mm and 3 mm
window (CN(1-0), CS(2-1), CH$_3$OH(2-1), N$_2$H$^+$(1-0), HC$_3$N(10-9)) at ~1
kpc resolution. A total observation time of 149 h offers unprecedented
sensitivity. We use these data to explore several CO isotopologue line ratios
in detail, study their radial (and azimuthal) trends and investigate whether
changes in line ratios stem from changes in ISM properties such as gas
temperatures, densities or chemical abundances. For example, we find negative
radial trends for the $^{13}$CO}/$^{12}$CO, C$^{18}$O/$^{12}$CO and
C$^{18}$O/$^{13}$CO line ratios in their J=1-0 transitions. We also find
variations with local environment, such as higher $^{12}$CO(2-1)/(1-0) or
$^{13}$CO/$^{12}$CO(1-0) line ratios in interarm regions compared to spiral arm
regions. We propose that these aforementioned variations of CO line ratios are
most likely due to a variation of the optical depth, while abundance variations
due to selective nucleosynthesis on a galaxy-wide scale could also play a role.
We also study the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) using archival
JCMT $^{12}$CO(3-2) data and find a variation of the SLED shape with local
environmental parameters further underlying changes in optical depth, gas
temperatures or densities.

Title:The eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS): X-ray emission around star-forming and quiescent galaxies at $0.05<z<0.3$,"
Abstract:  We aim at characterizing the hot phase of the Circum-Galactic Medium in a
large sample of galaxies. We stack X-ray events from the SRG/eROSITA eFEDS
survey around central galaxies in the GAMA 9hr field to construct radially
projected soft X-ray luminosity profiles as a function of their stellar mass
and specific star formation rate. We consider samples of quiescent
(star-forming) galaxies in the stellar mass range $2\times 10^{10}$ --
$10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ ($3\times 10^9$ -- $6\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$). For
quiescent galaxies, the X-ray profiles are clearly extended throughout the
available mass range; however, the measured profile is likely biased high due
to projection effects, as these galaxies tend to live in dense and hot
environments. For the most massive star forming samples ($\geq10^{11}$
M$_\odot$), there is a hint of detection of extended emission. For star-forming
galaxies with $< 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ the X-ray stacked profiles are compatible
with unresolved sources and consistent with the expected emission from faint
Active Galactic Nuclei and X-ray binaries. We measure for the first time the
mean relation between average X-ray luminosity and stellar mass separately for
quiescent and star-forming galaxies. High-mass ($\geq 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$)
star-forming or quiescent galaxies follow the expected scaling of virialized
hot haloes, while lower mass star-forming galaxies show a less prominent
luminosity and a weaker dependence on stellar mass, consistent with empirical
models of the weak AGN population. When comparing our results with state-of-the
art numerical simulations, we find an overall consistency on large ($>80$ kpc)
scales at masses $\geq 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, but disagreement on the small
scales, where brighter than observed compact cores are predicted. Simulations
also do not predict the clear differentiation that we observe between quiescent
and star-forming galaxies.

Title:Gravitational Waves from an Inflation Triggered First-Order Phase Transition,"
Abstract:  Large excursion of the inflaton field can trigger interesting dynamics. One
important example is a first-order phase transition in a spectator sector which
couples to the inflaton. Gravitational waves (GWs) from such a first-order
phase transition during inflation, an example of an instantaneous source, have
an oscillatory feature. In this work, we show that this feature is generic for
a source in an era of accelerated expansion. We also demonstrate that the shape
of the GW signal contains information about the evolution of the early universe
following the phase transition. In particular, the slope of the infrared part
of the GW spectrum is sensitive to the evolution of the Hubble parameter when
the GW modes reenter the horizon after inflation. The slope of the profile of
the intermediate oscillatory part and the ultraviolet part of the GW spectrum
depend on the evolution of the Hubble parameter when the modes exit horizon
during the inflation and when they reenter the horizon during the reheating.
The ultraviolet spectrum also depends on the details of the dynamics of the
phase transition. We consider the GW signal in several models of evolution
during and after inflation, and compare them with the minimal scenario of
quasi-de Sitter inflation followed by radiation domination after a fast
reheating, and demonstrate that the shape of the GW can be used to distinguish
them. In this way, the GW signal considered in this paper offers a powerful
probe to the dynamics of the early universe which is otherwise difficult to

Title:A systematic search for galaxy protocluster cores at the transition epoch of their star formation activity,"
Abstract:  The redshift of $z\sim1.5$ is the transition epoch of protoclusters (PCs)
from the star-forming phase into the quenching phase, and hence an appropriate
era to investigate the build up of the quenched population. We define a `core'
as the most massive halo in a given PC, where environmental effects are likely
to work most effectively, and search for cores at $1<z<1.5$. We use a
photometric redshift catalogue of a wide (effective area of
$\sim22.2\,\mathrm{deg}^{2}$) and deep ($i\sim26.8\,\mathrm{mag}$) optical
survey with Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam. Regarding galaxies with
$\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})>11.3$ as the central galaxies of PC cores, we estimate
their average halo mass by clustering analysis and find it to be
$\log(M_\mathrm{h}/M_{\odot})\sim13.7$. An expected mass growth by the
IllustrisTNG simulation and the observed overdensities around them suggest that
the PC cores we find are progenitors of present-day clusters. Classifying our
galaxy sample into red and blue galaxies, we calculate the stellar mass
function (SMF) and the red galaxy fraction. The SMFs in the PC cores are
more-top heavy than field, implying early high-mass galaxy formation and
disruption of low-mass galaxies. We also find that the red fraction increases
with stellar mass, consistent with stellar-mass dependent environmental
quenching recently found at $z>1$. Interestingly, although the cores with red
and blue centrals have similar halo masses, only those with red centrals show a
significant red fraction excess compared to the field, suggesting a conformity
effect. Some observational features of PC cores may imply that the conformity
is caused by assembly bias.

Title:Multi Order Coverage data structure to plan multi-messenger observations,"
Abstract:  We describe the use of Multi Order Coverage (MOC) maps as a practical way to
manage complex regions of the sky for the planning of multi-messenger
observations. MOC maps are a data structure that provides a multi-resolution
representation of irregularly shaped and fragmentary regions over the sky based
on the HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization) tessellation.
We present a new application of MOC, in combination with the \texttt{astroplan}
observation planning package, to enable the efficient computation of sky
regions and the visibility of these regions from a specific location on the
Earth at a particular time.
Using the example of the low-latency gravitational-wave alerts, and a
simulated observational campaign with three observatories, we show that the use
of MOC maps allows a high level of interoperability to support observing
schedule plans. Gravitational-wave detections have an associated credible
region localization on the sky. We demonstrate that these localizations can be
encoded as MOC maps, and how they can be used in visualisation tools, and
processed (filtered, combined) and also their utility for access to Virtual
Observatory services which can be queried 'by MOC' for data within the region
of interest. The ease of generating the MOC maps and the fast access to data
means that the whole system can be very efficient, so that any updates on the
gravitational-wave sky localization can be quickly taken into account and the
corresponding adjustments to observing schedule plans can be rapidly
implemented. We provide example python code as a practical example of these
methods. In addition, a video demonstration of the entire workflow is
available.

Title:Structure Formation in Dark Matter Particle Production Cosmology,"
Abstract:  We investigate a cosmological scenario in which the dark matter particles can
be created during the evolution of the Universe. By regarding the Universe as
an open thermodynamic system and using non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we
examine the mechanism of gravitational particle production. In this setup, we
study the large-scale structure (LSS) formation of the Universe in the
Newtonian regime of perturbations and derive the equations governing the
evolution of the dark matter overdensities. Then, we implement the cosmological
data from Planck 2018 CMB measurements, SNe Ia and BAO observations, as well as
the Riess et al. (2019) local measurement for $H_0$ to provide some
cosmological constraints for the parameters of our model. We see that the best
case of our scenario ($\chi_{\rm tot}^{2}=3834.40$) fits the observational
data better than the baseline $\Lambda$CDM model ($\chi_{\rm tot}^{2} =
3838.00$) at the background level. We moreover estimate the growth factor of
linear perturbations and show that the best case of our model
($\chi_{f\sigma_{8}}^{2}=39.85$) fits the LSS data significantly better than
the $\Lambda$CDM model ($\chi_{f\sigma_{8}}^{2}=45.29$). Consequently, our
model also makes a better performance at the level of the linear perturbations
compared to the standard cosmological model.

Title:Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Three-Point Shear Correlations and Mass Aperture Moments,"
Abstract:  We present high signal-to-noise measurements of three-point shear
correlations and the third moment of the mass aperture statistic using the
first 3 years of data from the Dark Energy Survey. We additionally obtain the
first measurements of the configuration and scale dependence of the four
three-point shear correlations which carry cosmological information. With the
third-order mass aperture statistic, we present tomographic measurements over
angular scales of 4 to 60 arcminutes with a combined statistical significance
of 15.0$\sigma$. Using the tomographic information and measuring also the
second-order mass aperture, we additionally obtain a skewness parameter and its
redshift evolution. We find that the amplitudes and scale-dependence of these
shear 3pt functions are in qualitative agreement with measurements in a mock
galaxy catalog based on N-body simulations, indicating promise for including
them in future cosmological analyses. We validate our measurements by showing
that B-modes, parity-violating contributions and PSF modeling uncertainties are
negligible, and determine that the measured signals are likely to be of
astrophysical and gravitational origin.

Title:Stellar dating using chemical clocks and Bayesian inference,"
Abstract:  Dating stars is a major challenge with a deep impact on many astrophysical
fields. One of the most promising techniques for this is using chemical
abundances. Recent space- and ground-based facilities have improved the
quantity of stars with accurate observations. This has opened the door for
using Bayesian inference tools to maximise the information we can extract from
them. Our aim is to present accurate and reliable stellar age estimates of FGK
stars using chemical abundances and stellar parameters. We used one of the most
flexible Bayesian inference techniques (hierarchical Bayesian models) to exceed
current possibilities in the use of chemical abundances for stellar dating. Our
model is a data-driven model. We used a training set that has been presented in
the literature with ages estimated with isochrones and accurate stellar
abundances and general characteristics. The core of the model is a prescription
of certain abundance ratios as linear combinations of stellar properties
including age. We gathered four different testing sets to assess the accuracy,
precision, and limits of our model. We also trained a model using chemical
abundances alone. We found that our age estimates and those coming from
asteroseismology, other accurate sources, and also with ten Gaia benchmark
stars agree well. The mean absolute difference of our estimates compared with
those used as reference is 0.9 Ga, with a mean difference of 0.01 Ga. When
using open clusters, we reached a very good agreement for Hyades, NGC 2632,
Ruprecht 147, and IC4651. We also found outliers that are a reflection of
chemical peculiarities and/or stars at the limit of the validity ranges of the
training set. The model that only uses chemical abundances shows slightly worse
mean absolute difference (1.18 Ga) and mean difference (-0.12 Ga).

Title:Disentangling the neighbouring pulsars SXP 15.3 and SXP 305,"
Abstract:  SXP 15.3 and SXP 305 are two Be X-ray binaries in the Small Magellanic Cloud
that are spatially separated by ~7 arcsec. The small separation between these
sources has, in the past, resulted in confusion about the origin of the
emission from the combined region. We present long-term optical and X-ray
monitoring results of both sources, where we study the historic and recent
behaviour. In particular, from data collected as part of the S-CUBED project we
see repeating X-ray outbursts from the combined region of the two sources in
the recent lightcurve from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and we
investigate the origin of this emission. Using the H-alpha emission line from
the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and photometric flux from the
Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to study the changes in the
size and structure of the Be disc, we demonstrate that the X-ray emission
likely originates from SXP 15.3. Timing analysis reveals unusual behaviour,
where the optical outburst profile shows modulation at twice the frequency of
the X-ray outbursts. We consider either of these periodicities being the true
orbital period in SXP 15.3 and propose models based on the geometric
orientations of the Be disc and neutron star to explain the physical origin of
the outbursts.

"Title:Standardizing Platinum Dainotti-correlated gamma-ray bursts, and using them with standardized Amati-correlated gamma-ray bursts to constrain cosmological model parameters","
Abstract:  We show that the Platinum gamma-ray burst (GRB) data compilation, probing the

three-parameter fundamental plane (Dainotti) correlation and so is
standardizable. While they probe the largely unexplored $z \sim 2.3-5$ part of
cosmological redshift space, the GRB cosmological parameter constraints are
consistent with, but less precise than, those from a combination of baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) and Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] data. In order to
increase the precision of GRB-only cosmological constraints, we exclude common
GRBs from the larger Amati-correlated A118 data set composed of 118 GRBs and
jointly analyze the remaining 101 Amati-correlated GRBs with the 50 Platinum

restrictive, and consistent with, but less precise than, those from $H(z)$ +

Title:Galaxy Correlation Function and Local Density from Photometric Redshifts Using the Stochastic Order Redshift Technique (SORT),"
Abstract:  The stochastic order redshift technique (SORT) is a simple, efficient, and
robust method to improve cosmological redshift measurements. The method relies
upon having a small ($\sim$10 per cent) reference sample of high-quality
redshifts. Within pencil-beam-like sub-volumes surrounding each galaxy, we use
the precise dN/d$z$ distribution of the reference sample to recover new
redshifts and assign them one-to-one to galaxies such that the original rank
order of redshifts is preserved. Preserving the rank order is motivated by the
fact that random variables drawn from Gaussian probability density functions
with different means but equal standard deviations satisfy stochastic ordering.
The process is repeated for sub-volumes surrounding each galaxy in the survey.
This results in every galaxy with an uncertain redshift being assigned multiple
""recovered"" redshifts from which a new redshift estimate can be determined. An
earlier paper applied SORT to a mock Sloan Digital Sky Survey at $z \lesssim$
0.2 and accurately recovered the two-point correlation function on scales
$\gtrsim$4 $h^{-1}$Mpc. In this paper, we test the performance of SORT in
surveys spanning the redshift range 0.75$<z<$2.25. We used two mock surveys
extracted from the Small MultiDark-Planck and Bolshoi-Planck N-body simulations
with dark matter haloes that were populated by the Santa Cruz semi-analytic
model. We find that SORT is able to improve redshift estimates and recover
distinctive large-scale features of the cosmic web. Further, it provides
unbiased estimates of the redshift-space two-point correlation function
$\xi(s)$ on scales $\gtrsim$2.5 $h^{-1}$Mpc, as well as local densities in
regions of average or higher density. This may allow improved understanding of
how galaxy properties relate to their local environments.

Title:Systematics in the SED Fitting Parameter Estimation of Composite Galaxies,"
Abstract:  Derivation of physical properties of galaxies using spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting is a powerful method, but can suffer from various
systematics arising from model assumptions. Previously, such biases were mostly
studied in the context of individual galaxies. In this study, we investigate
potential biases arising from performing the SED fitting on the combined light
of two galaxies, as would be the case in post-merger systems. We use
GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog (GSWLC) of z<0.3 galaxies to identify 9,000
galaxy pairs that could eventually merge. For these we investigate if the
UV/optical SED fitting accurately determines the stellar mass and (specific)
star formation rate if the pair was unresolved (merged). The sum of the stellar
masses (and SFRs) of individual galaxies in the pair establishes the ground
truth for these quantities. For star forming galaxies no biases (<0.1 dex) are
found in the stellar mass, SFR, or sSFRs. Moderate systematics in SFR (~0.1
dex) are found for systems with an extreme contrast in dust content between the
two galaxies. We conclude that biases that would arise in the determination of
masses and SFRs of post-merger systems on account of the two original galaxies
having potentially very different star formation histories and different dust
properties are small and that the approach with simple two-component star
formation histories is adequate. The approach presented in this study, using
flux compositing with empirically determined ground truth, offers new
opportunities for testing the results of SED fitting in general.

Title:Production Efficiencies of Sound Waves in the Intracluster Medium Driven by AGN Jets,"
Abstract:  Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is believed to be the most
promising solution to the cooling flow problem in cool-core clusters, though
how exactly the jet energy is transformed into heat is a subject of debate.
Dissipation of sound waves is considered as one of the possible heating
mechanisms; however, its relative contribution to heating remains unclear. To
estimate the energy budget for heating, we perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations
of AGN jet injections in a Perseus-like cluster and quantify the amount of
energy stored in the forms of weak shocks and waves. We find that, for a single
jet injection with typical parameters in cool-core clusters, $\sim9\%$ of the
total jet energy is stored in compressional waves (including both shocks and
waves). However, due to the destructive effects among randomly phased waves as
well as the dissipation of shock energies, in our simulations including
self-regulated AGN feedback, no more than $3\%$ of the total injected energy
goes into compressional waves. We further separate the energy contribution from
shocks and waves and find that, for a single outburst, the shocks can only
contribute to $\sim20-30\%$ of the total compressional energy in the inner
radii, and they dissipate very quickly as they travel outward. However, because
of the repeated generation of shocks by multiple AGN outbursts, in the
self-regulated case shocks completely dominate over sound waves in the inner
region and can still provide $\sim40-50\%$ of the total compressional energy
even at outer radii. Our results suggest that the production of sound waves is
not as efficient as what was found in previous single-outburst simulations, and
thus sound wave dissipation may be a subdominant source of heating in cool-core
clusters.

Title:Cosmological 21cm line observations to test scenarios of super-Eddington accretion on to black holes being seeds of high-redshifted supermassive black holes,"
Abstract:  In this paper, we study scenarios of the super-Eddington accretion onto black
holes at high redshifts $z > 10$, which are expected to be seeds to evolve to
supermassive black holes until redshift $z \sim 7$. For an initial mass,
$M_{\rm BH, ini} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{3} M_{\odot}$ of a seed BH, we
definitely need the super-Eddington accretion, which can be applicable to both
astrophysical and primordial origins. Such an accretion disk inevitably emitted
high-energy photons which had heated the cosmological plasma of the
inter-galactic medium continuously from high redshifts. In this case, the
cosmic history of cosmological gas temperature is modified, by which the
absorption feature of the cosmological 21 cm lines is suppressed. By comparing
theoretical predictions of the 21cm line absorption with the observational data
at $z\sim17$, we obtain a cosmological upper bound on the mass-accretion rate
as a function of the seed BH masses. In order to realize $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^9
M_{\odot}$ at $z \sim 7$ by a continuous mass-accretion on to a seed BH, to be
consistent with the cosmological 21cm line absorption at $z \sim 17$, we
obtained an severe upper bound on the initial mass of the seed BH to be $M_{\rm
BH, ini} \lesssim 10^2 M_{\odot}$ ($M_{\rm BH, ini} \lesssim 10^6 M_{\odot}$)
when we assume a seed BH with its comoving number density $n_{\rm seed,0} \sim
10^{-3} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ ($n_{\rm seed,0} \sim 10^{-7} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$). We also
discuss some implications for application to primordial black holes as the seed
black holes.

forming main sequence (rSFMS: $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ vs. $\Sigma_{*}$), the
resolved Schmidt-Kennicutt relation (rSK: $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ vs. $\Sigma_{\rm
H_{2}}$), and the resolved molecular gas main sequence (rMGMS: $\Sigma_{\rm
H_{2}}$ vs. $\Sigma_{*}$), for 11478 star-forming and 1414 retired spaxels
(oversampled by a factor of $\sim20$) located in 22 green valley (GV) and 12
main sequence (MS) galaxies. For a given galaxy type (MS or GV), the retired
spaxels are found to be offset from the sequences formed by the star-forming
spaxels on the rSFMS, rSK, and rMGMS planes, toward lower absolute values of
sSFR, SFE, and $f_{\rm H_{2}}$ by $\sim$ 1.1, 0.6, and 0.5 dex. The scaling
relations for GV galaxies are found to be distinct from that of the MS
galaxies, even if the analyses are restricted to the star-forming spaxels only.
It is found that for star-forming spaxels, sSFR, SFE, and $f_{\rm H_{2}}$ in GV
galaxies are reduced by $\sim$0.36, 0.14, and 0.21 dex, respectively, compared
to those in MS galaxies. Therefore, the suppressed sSFR/SFE/$f_{\rm H_{2}}$ in
GV galaxies are associated with not only an increased proportion of retired
regions in GV galaxies but also a depletion of these quantities in star-forming
regions. Finally, the reduction of SFE and $f_{\rm H_{2}}$ in GV galaxies
relative to MS galaxies is seen in both bulge and disk regions (albeit with
larger uncertainties), suggesting that statistically, quenching in the GV
population may persist from the inner to the outer regions.

Title:Impact of the SpaceX Starlink Satellites on the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey Observations,"
Abstract:  There is a growing concern about an impact of low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite
constellations on ground-based astronomical observations, in particular, on
wide-field surveys in the optical and infrared. The Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF), thanks to the large field of view of its camera, provides an ideal setup
to study the effects of LEO megaconstellations - such as SpaceX's Starlink - on
astronomical surveys. Here, we analyze the archival ZTF observations collected
between 2019 November and 2021 September and find 5301 satellite streaks that
can be attributed to Starlink satellites. We find that the number of affected
images is increasing with time as SpaceX deploys more and more satellites.
Twilight observations are particularly affected - a fraction of streaked images
taken during twilight has increased from less than 0.5% in late 2019 to 18% in
2021 August. We estimate that once the size of the Starlink constellation
reaches 10,000, essentially all ZTF images taken during twilight may be
affected. However, despite the increase in satellite streaks observed during
the analyzed period, the current science operations of ZTF are not yet strongly
affected. We also find that redesigning Starlink satellites (by installing
visors intended to block sunlight from reaching the satellite antennas to
prevent reflection) reduces their brightness by a factor of 4.6 +/- 0.1 with
respect to the original design in g, r, and i bands.

Title:V456 Cyg: An eclipsing binary with tidally perturbed g-mode pulsations,"
Abstract:  Context. Many well-known bright stars have been observed by the ongoing
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) space mission. For several of
them, these new data reveal previously unobserved variability, such as tidally
perturbed pulsations in close binary stars. Aims. Using newly detected
gravity-mode (g-mode) pulsations in V456 Cyg, we aim to determine the global
stellar properties of this short-period eclipsing binary and evaluate the
interaction between these pulsations and the tides. Methods. We model the
binary orbit and determine the physical properties of the component stars using
the TESS photometry and published spectroscopy. We then measure the pulsation
frequencies from the residuals of the light curve fit using iterative
prewhitening, and analyse them to determine the global asteroseismic stellar
parameters. We evaluate the pulsation parameters as a function of the orbital
phase. Results. We find that the pulsations belong to the secondary component
of V456 Cyg and that this star likely has a uniform radial rotation profile,
synchronous ($\nu_{\rm rot} = 1.113(14) \rm d^{-1}$) with the binary orbit
($\nu_{\rm orb} = 1.122091(8) \rm d^{-1}$). The observed g modes are amplified
by almost a factor three in the stellar hemisphere facing the primary. We
present evidence that this is caused by tidal perturbation of the pulsations,
with the mode coupling being strongly affected. Conclusions. V456 Cyg is only
the second object for which tidally perturbed high-order g-mode pulsations are
identified, after $\pi^5$ Ori. This opens up new opportunities for tidal g-mode
asteroseismology, as it demonstrates another avenue in which g modes and tides
can interact with each other.

Abstract:  The recently discovered near-Earth asteroid 2021 PH27 has the shortest

also an active asteroid, as (3200) Phaethon. We intend to estimate the
consequences of this hypothesis, although testing is difficult with
ground-based observations during perihelion passages, due to low solar
elongation. Assuming a surface activity similar to that of Phaethon, an
increase in brightness of about 1.4 mag can be estimated. Since it is an
asteroid with a MOID of $0.014660 \pm 0.000034$ AU with Venus, 2021 PH27 could

Title:Predicting the redshift of gamma-ray loud AGNs using Supervised Machine Learning: Part 2,"
Abstract:  Measuring the redshift of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) requires the use of
time-consuming and expensive spectroscopic analysis. However, obtaining
redshift measurements of AGNs is crucial as it can enable AGN population
studies, provide insight into the star formation rate, the luminosity function,
and the density rate evolution. Hence, there is a requirement for alternative
redshift measurement techniques. In this project, we aim to use the Fermi
gamma-ray space telescope's 4LAC Data Release (DR2) catalog to train a machine
learning model capable of predicting the redshift reliably. In addition, this
project aims at improving and extending with the new 4LAC Catalog the
predictive capabilities of the machine learning (ML) methodology published in
Dainotti et al. (2021). Furthermore, we implement feature engineering to expand
the parameter space and a bias correction technique to our final results. This
study uses additional machine learning techniques inside the ensemble method,
the SuperLearner, previously used in Dainotti et al.(2021). Additionally, we
also test a novel ML model called Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE).
Using these methods we provide a catalog of estimated redshift values for those
AGNs that do not have a spectroscopic redshift measurement. These estimates can
serve as a redshift reference for the community to verify as updated Fermi
catalogs are released with more redshift measurements.

Abstract:  We report the discoveries of a nuclear ring of diameter 10$\arcsec$
($\sim$1.5 kpc) and a potential low luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN)
in the radio continuum emission map of the edge-on barred spiral galaxy
NGC~5792. These discoveries are based on the Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies
- an Expanded Very Large Array (VLA) Survey, as well as subsequent VLA
observations of sub-arcsecond resolution. Using a mixture of H$\alpha$ and 24
$\mu$m calibration, we disentangle the thermal and non-thermal radio emission
of the nuclear region, and derive a star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim
0.4~M_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$. We find that the nuclear ring is dominated by
non-thermal synchrotron emission. The synchrotron-based SFR is about three
times of the mixture-based SFR. This result indicates that the nuclear ring
underwent more intense star-forming activity in the past, and now its star
formation is in the low state. The sub-arcsecond VLA images resolve six
individual knots on the nuclear ring. The equipartition magnetic field strength
$B_{\rm eq}$ of the knots varies from 77 to 88 $\mu$G. The radio ring surrounds
a point-like faint radio core of $S_{\rm 6GHz}=(16\pm4)$ $\mu$Jy with polarized
lobes at the center of NGC~5792, which suggests an LLAGN with an Eddington
ratio $\sim10^{-5}$. This radio nuclear ring is reminiscent of the Central

whose kinematic features are consistent with those of the disk stellar
populations. We report the discovery of an RR~Lyrae variable (hereafter RRL)
that is located within the thick disk and has an orbit consistent with the
thick-disk kinematics. Our target RRL (HD 331986) is located at around 1 kpc
from the Sun and, with V=11.3, is among the 130 brightest RRLs known so far.
However, this object was scarcely studied because it is in the midplane of the
Galaxy, the Galactic latitude around -1 deg. Its near-infrared spectrum
(0.91-1.32 micron) shows no absorption line except hydrogen lines of the
Paschen series, suggesting [Fe/H] less than -2.5. It is the most
metal-deficient RRL, at least, among the RRLs whose orbits are consistent with
the disk kinematics, although we cannot determine to which of the disk and the
halo it belongs. This unique RRL would provide us with essential clues for
studying the early formation of stars in the inner Galaxy with further

"Title:Influence of the gravitational darkening effect on the spectrum of a hot, rapidly rotating neutron star","
Abstract:  In this paper, we discuss the influence of the gravitational darkening effect
on the emergent spectrum of a fast-rotating, flattened neutron star. Model
atmosphere codes always calculate spectra of emergent intensities and fluxes
emitted from the unit surface on the star in plane-parallel geometry. Here we
took a step beyond that and calculated a small sample grid of theoretical
spectra integrated over the distorted surface of a sample rotating neutron star
seen by a distant observer at various inclination angles. We assumed parameters
like two dimensionless angular velocities $\bar{\Omega}^2=0.30$ and 0.60, the
effective temperature of a nonrotating star $T_{\rm eff}=2.20\times 10^7\,$K,
the logarithm of the surface gravity of a spherical star $\log(g)=14.40$ (cgs),
and inclination angles from $i=0^\circ$ to $i=90^\circ$ with step $\Delta
i=10^\circ$. We assumed that the atmosphere consists of a mixture of hydrogen
and helium with $M_{\rm H}=0.70$ and $M_{\rm He}=0.30$. At each point on the
neutron star surface, we calculated true intensities for local values of
parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log(g)$), and these monochromatic intensities
are next integrated over the whole surface to obtain the emergent spectrum. In
this paper, we compute for the first time theoretical spectra of the
fast-rotating neutron star. Our work clearly shows that the gravitational
darkening effect strongly influences the spectrum and should be included in
realistic models of the atmospheres of rotating neutron stars.

Title:Systematic biases in determining dust attenuation curves through galaxy SED fitting,"
Abstract:  While the slope of the dust attenuation curve ($\delta$) is found to
correlate with effective dust attenuation ($A_V$) as obtained through spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting, it remains unknown how the fitting
degeneracies shape this relation. We examine the degeneracy effects by fitting
SEDs of a sample of local star-forming galaxies (SFGs) selected from the Galaxy
And Mass Assembly survey, in conjunction with mock galaxy SEDs of known
attenuation parameters. A well-designed declining starburst star formation
history is adopted to generate model SED templates with intrinsic UV slope
($\beta_0$) spanning over a reasonably wide range. The best-fitting $\beta_0$
for our sample SFGs shows a wide coverage, dramatically differing from the
limited range of $\beta_0<-2.2$ for a starburst of constant star formation. Our
results show that strong degeneracies between $\beta_0$, $\delta$, and $A_V$ in
the SED fitting induce systematic biases leading to a false $A_V$--$\delta$
correlation. Our simulation tests reveal that this relationship can be well
reproduced even when a flat $A_V$--$\delta$ relation is taken to build the
input model galaxy SEDs. The variations in best-fitting $\delta$ are dominated
by the fitting errors. We show that assuming a starburst with constant star
formation in SED fitting will result in a steeper attenuation curve, smaller
degeneracy errors, and a stronger $A_V$--$\delta$ relation. Our findings
confirm that the $A_V$--$\delta$ relation obtained through SED fitting is
likely driven by the systematic biases induced by the fitting degeneracies
between $\beta_0$, $\delta$, and $A_V$.

Title:Multi-scale decomposition of astronomical maps -- a constrained diffusion method,"
Abstract:  We propose a new, efficient multi-scale method to decompose a map (or signal
in general) into components maps that contain structures of different sizes. In
the widely-used wave transform, artifacts containing negative values arise
around regions with sharp transitions due to the application of band-limited
filters. In our approach, the decomposition is achieved by solving a modified,
non-linear version of the diffusion equation. This is inspired by the
anisotropic diffusion methods, which establish the link between image filtering
and partial differential equations. In our case, the artifact issue is
addressed where the positivity of the decomposed images is guaranteed. Our new
method is particularly suitable for signals which contain localized, non-linear
features, as typical of astronomical observations. It can be used to study the
multi-scale structures of astronomical maps quantitatively and should be useful
in observation-related tasks such as background removal. We thus propose a new
measure called the ""scale spectrum"", which describes how the image values
distribute among different components in the scale space, to describe maps. The
method allows for input arrays of an arbitrary number of dimensions, and a
python3 implementation of the algorithms is included in the Appendix and
available at this https URL.

Title:The role of plasma instabilities in relativistic radiation mediated shocks: stability analysis and particle-in-cell simulations,"
Abstract:  Relativistic radiation mediated shocks (RRMS) likely form in prodigious
cosmic explosions. The structure and emission of such shocks is regulated by
copious production of electron-positron pairs inside the shock transition
layer. It has been pointed out recently that substantial abundance of positrons
inside the shock leads to a velocity separation of the different plasma
constituents, which is expected to induce a rapid growth of plasma
instabilities. In this paper, we study the hierarchy of plasma
microinstabilities growing in an electron-ion plasma loaded with pairs and
subject to a radiation force. Linear stability analysis indicates that such a
system is unstable to the growth of various plasma modes which ultimately
become dominated by a current filamentation instability driven by the relative
drift between the ions and the pairs. These results are validated by
particle-in-cell simulations that further probe the nonlinear regime of the
instabilities, and the pair-ion coupling in the microturbulent electromagnetic
field. Based on this analysis, we derive a reduced transport equation for the
particles via pitch angle scattering in the microturbulence and demonstrate
that it can couple the different species and lead to nonadiabatic compression
via a Joule-like heating. The heating of the pairs and, conceivably, the
formation of nonthermal distributions, arising from the microturbulence, can
affect the observed shock breakout signal in ways unaccounted for by current
single-fluid models.

Title:X-ray burst and persistent emission properties of the magnetar SGR 1830-0645 in outburst,"
Abstract:  We report on NICER X-ray monitoring of the magnetar SGR 1830-0645 covering
223 days following its October 2020 outburst, as well as Chandra and radio
observations. We present the most accurate spin ephemerides of the source so
far: $\nu=0.096008680(2)$~Hz, $\dot{\nu}=-6.2(1)\times10^{-14}$~Hz~s$^{-1}$,
and a significant second and third frequency derivative terms indicative of
non-negligible timing noise. The phase-averaged 0.8--7~keV spectrum is well fit
with a double-blackbody (BB) model throughout the campaign. The BB temperatures
remain constant at 0.46 and 1.2 keV. The areas and flux of each component
decreased by a factor of 6, initially through a steep decay trend lasting about
46 days followed by a shallow long-term one. The pulse shape in the same energy
range is initially complex, exhibiting three distinct peaks, yet with clear
continuous evolution throughout the outburst towards a simpler, single-pulse
shape. The rms pulsed fraction is high and increases from about 40% to 50%. We
find no dependence of pulse shape or fraction on energy. These results suggest
that multiple hotspots, possibly possessing temperature gradients, emerged at
outburst-onset, and shrank as the outburst decayed. We detect 84 faint bursts
with \nicer, having a strong preference for occurring close to the surface
emission pulse maximum the first time this phenomenon is detected in such a
large burst sample. This likely implies a very low altitude for the burst
emission region, and a triggering mechanism connected to the surface active
zone. Finally, our radio observations at several epochs and multiple
frequencies reveal no evidence of pulsed or burst-like radio emission.

Title:Monte Carlo Simulation of Dust Particles in a Protoplanetary Disk: Crystalline to Amorphous Silicate Ratio in Comets,"
Abstract:  Observationally inferred crystalline abundance in silicates in comets, which
should have been formed in the outer region of a protoplanetary disk, is
relatively high (~ 10-60%), although crystalline silicates would be formed by
annealing of amorphous precursors in the disk inner region. In order to
quantitatively address this puzzle, we have performed Monte Carlo simulation of
advection/diffusion of silicate particles in a turbulent disk, in the setting
based on pebble accretion model: pebbles consisting of many small amorphous
silicates embedded in icy mantle are formed in the disk outer region, silicate
particles are released at the snow line, crystalline silicate particles are
produced at the annealing line, the silicate particles diffused beyond the snow
line, and they eventually stick to drifting pebbles to come back to the snow
line. In a simple case without the sticking and with a steady pebble flux, we
show through the simulations and analytical arguments that crystalline
components in silicate materials beyond the snow line is robustly and uniformly
~ 5%. On the other hand, in a more realistic case with the sticking and with a
decaying pebble flux, the crystalline abundance is raised up to ~ 20-25%,
depending on the ratio of decay and diffusion timescales. This abundance is
consistent with the observations. In this investigation, we assume a simple
steady accretion disk. The simulations coupled with the disk evolution is
needed for more detailed comparison with observed data.

Title:MOBSTER -- VI. The crucial influence of rotation on the radio magnetospheres of hot stars,"
Abstract:  Numerous magnetic hot stars exhibit gyrosynchrotron radio emission. The
source electrons were previously thought to be accelerated to relativistic
velocities in the current sheet formed in the middle magnetosphere by the wind
opening magnetic field lines. However, a lack of dependence of radio luminosity
on the wind power, and a strong dependence on rotation, has recently challenged
this paradigm. We have collected all radio measurements of magnetic early-type
stars available in the literature. When constraints on the magnetic field
and/or the rotational period are not available, we have determined these using
previously unpublished spectropolarimetric and photometric data. The result is
the largest sample of magnetic stars with radio observations that has yet been
analyzed: 131 stars with rotational and magnetic constraints, of which 50 are
radio-bright. We confirm an obvious dependence of gyrosynchrotron radiation on
rotation, and furthermore find that accounting for rotation neatly separates
stars with and without detected radio emission. There is a close correlation
between H$\alpha$ emission strength and radio luminosity. These factors suggest
that radio emission may be explained by the same mechanism responsible for
H$\alpha$ emission from centrifugal magnetospheres, i.e. centrifugal breakout
(CBO), however, whereas the H$\alpha$-emitting magnetosphere probes the cool
plasma before breakout, radio emission is a consequence of electrons
accelerated in centrifugally-driven magnetic reconnection.

Title:Pulse Peak Migration during the Outburst Decay of the Magnetar SGR 1830-0645: Crustal Motion and Magnetospheric Untwisting,"
Abstract:  Magnetars, isolated neutron stars with magnetic field strengths typically
$\gtrsim10^{14}$~G, exhibit distinctive months-long outburst epochs during
which strong evolution of soft X-ray pulse profiles, along with nonthermal
magnetospheric emission components, is often observed. Using near-daily NICER
observations of the magnetar SGR 1830-0645 during the first 37 days of a recent
outburst decay, a pulse peak migration in phase is clearly observed,
transforming the pulse shape from an initially triple-peaked to a single-peaked
profile. Such peak merging has not been seen before for a magnetar. Our
high-resolution phase-resolved spectroscopic analysis reveals no significant
evolution of temperature despite the complex initial pulse shape. Yet the
inferred surface hot spots shrink during the peak migration and outburst decay.
We suggest two possible origins for this evolution. For internal heating of the
surface, tectonic motion of the crust may be its underlying cause. The inferred
speed of this crustal motion is $\lesssim100$~m~day$^{-1}$, constraining the
density of the driving region to $\rho\sim10^{10}$~g~cm$^{-3}$, at a depth of
$\sim200$~m. Alternatively, the hot spots could be heated by particle
bombardment from a twisted magnetosphere possessing flux tubes or ropes,
somewhat resembling solar coronal loops, that untwist and dissipate on the
30-40~day timescale. The peak migration may then be due to a combination of
field-line footpoint motion (necessarily driven by crustal motion) and evolving
surface radiation beaming. These novel dataset paints a vivid picture of the
dynamics associated with magnetar outbursts, yet it also highlights the need
for a more generic theoretical picture where magnetosphere and crust are
considered in tandem.

Title:FEEDBACK from the NGC7538 HII region,"
Abstract:  Context: How do expanding HII regions interact with their environmental
cloud? This is one of the central questions driving the SOFIA legacy program
FEEDBACK. Here, we present a case study toward the prototypical H{\sc ii}
region NGC7538. Methods: With SOFIA we mapped an area of ~210'^2 around NGC7538
in the [CII] line at 1.9THz. Complementary observed atomic carbon [CI] and
high-J CO(8-7) data as well as archival NIR/FIR, cm continuum, CO(3-2) and HI
data are folded into the analysis. Results: While the overall [CII] morphology
follows the general ionized gas, the channel maps show multiple bubble-like
structures with sizes on the order of ~80-100"" (~1.0-1.28pc). While at least
one of them may be an individual feedback bubble driven by the main exciting
sources of the region, the other bubble-morphologies may also be due to the
intrinsically porous structure of the HII region. An analysis of the expansion
velocities around 10km s^{-1} indicates that thermal expansion is not
sufficient but that wind-driving from the central O-stars is required. The most
blue-shifted [CII] component has barely any molecular or atomic counterparts.
At the interface to the molecular cloud, we find a typical photon-dominated
region (PDR) with a bar-shape. Ionized, atomic and molecular carbon show a
layered structure in this PDR. The carbon in the PDR is dominated by its
ionized form with atomic and molecular masses of ~0.45+-0.1M_{\odot} and
~1.2+-0.1M_{\odot}, respectively, compared to the ionized carbon in the range
of 3.6-9.7M_{\odot}. Conclusions: The NGC7538 HII region exhibits a diverse set
of sub-structures that interact with each other as well as with the adjacent
cloud. Compared to other recent [CII] observations of HII regions (e.g., Orion
Veil, RCW120, RCW49), bubble-shape morphologies revealed in [CII] emission,
indicative of expanding shells, are recurring structures of PDRs.

Title:ACE SWICS observations of solar cycle variations of the solar wind,"
Abstract:  In the present work we utilize ACE/SWICS in-situ measurements of the
properties of the solar wind outside ICMEs in order to determine whether, and
to what extent are the solar wind properties affected by the solar cycle. We
focus on proton temperatures and densities, ion temperatures and differential
speeds, charge state distributions and both relative and absolute elemental
abundances. We carry out this work dividing the wind in velocity bins to
investigate how winds at different speeds react to the solar cycle. We also
repeat this study, when possible, to the subset of SWICS measurements less
affected by Coulomb collisions. We find that with the only exception of
differential speeds (for which we do not have enough measurements) all wind
properties change as a function of the solar cycle. Our results point towards a
scenario where both the slow and fast solar wind are accelerated by waves, but
originate from different sources (open/closed magnetic structures for the
fast/slow wind, respectively) whose relative contribution changes along the
solar cycle. We also find that the signatures of heating and acceleration on
one side, and of the FIP effect on the other, indicate that wave-based plasma
heating, acceleration and fractionation remain active throughout the solar
cycle, but decrease their effectiveness in all winds, although the slow wind is
much affected than the fast one.

Title:Probabilistic Mass Mapping with Neural Score Estimation,"
Abstract:  Weak lensing mass-mapping is a useful tool to access the full distribution of
dark matter on the sky, but because of intrinsic galaxy ellipticies and finite
fields/missing data, the recovery of dark matter maps constitutes a challenging
ill-posed inverse problem. We introduce a novel methodology allowing for
efficient sampling of the high-dimensional Bayesian posterior of the weak
lensing mass-mapping problem, and relying on simulations for defining a fully
non-Gaussian prior. We aim to demonstrate the accuracy of the method on
simulations, and then proceed to applying it to the mass reconstruction of the
HST/ACS COSMOS field. The proposed methodology combines elements of Bayesian
statistics, analytic theory, and a recent class of Deep Generative Models based
on Neural Score Matching. This approach allows us to do the following: 1) Make
full use of analytic cosmological theory to constrain the 2pt statistics of the
solution. 2) Learn from cosmological simulations any differences between this
analytic prior and full simulations. 3) Obtain samples from the full Bayesian
posterior of the problem for robust Uncertainty Quantification. We demonstrate
the method on the $\kappa$TNG simulations and find that the posterior mean
significantly outperfoms previous methods (Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter,
Sparsity priors) both on root-mean-square error and in terms of the Pearson
correlation. We further illustrate the interpretability of the recovered
posterior by establishing a close correlation between posterior convergence
values and SNR of clusters artificially introduced into a field. Finally, we
apply the method to the reconstruction of the HST/ACS COSMOS field and yield
the highest quality convergence map of this field to date.

Title:Spectral Power-law Formation by Sequential Particle Acceleration in Multiple Flare Magnetic Islands,"
Abstract:  We present a first-principles model of pitch-angle and energy distribution
function evolution as particles are sequentially accelerated by multiple flare
magnetic islands. Data from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of an
eruptive flare/coronal mass ejection provide ambient conditions for the
evolving particle distributions. Magnetic islands, which are created by
sporadic reconnection at the self-consistently formed flare current sheet,
contract and accelerate the particles. The particle distributions are evolved
using rules derived in our previous work. In this investigation, we assume that
a prescribed fraction of particles sequentially ""hops"" to another accelerator
and receives an additional boost in energy and anisotropy. This sequential
process generates particle number spectra that obey an approximate power law at
mid-range energies and presents low- and high-energy breaks. We analyze these
spectral regions as functions of the model parameters. We also present a fully
analytic method for forming and interpreting such spectra, independent of the
sequential acceleration model. The method requires only a few constrained
physical parameters, such as the percentage of particles transferred between
accelerators, the energy gain in each accelerator, and the number of
accelerators visited. Our investigation seeks to bridge the gap between MHD and
kinetic regimes by combining global simulations and analytic kinetic theory.
The model reproduces and explains key characteristics of observed flare hard
X-ray spectra as well as the underlying properties of the accelerated
particles. Our analytic model provides tools to interpret high-energy
observations for missions and telescopes, such as RHESSI, FOXSI, NuSTAR, Solar
Orbiter, EOVSA, and future high-energy missions.

Title:Characterization of the GeV emission from the Kepler supernova remnant,"
Abstract:  The Kepler supernova remnant (SNR) is the only historic supernova remnant
lacking a detection at GeV and TeV energies which probe particle acceleration.
A recent analysis of Fermi-LAT data reported a likely GeV gamma-ray candidate
in the direction of the SNR. Using approximately the same dataset but with an
optimized analysis configuration, we confirm the gamma-ray candidate to a solid
$>6\sigma$ detection and report a spectral index of $2.14 \pm 0.12_{\rm stat}
\pm 0.15_{\rm syst}$ for an energy flux above 100 MeV of $(3.1 \pm 0.6_{\rm
stat} \pm 0.3_{\rm syst}) \times 10^{-12}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The
gamma-ray excess is not significantly extended and is fully compatible with the
radio, infrared or X-ray spatial distribution of the SNR. We successfully
characterized this multi-wavelength emission with a model in which accelerated
particles interact with the dense circumstellar material in the North-West
portion of the SNR and radiate GeV gamma-rays through $\pi^{o}$ decay. The
X-ray synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) emission mostly stem from the fast
shocks in the southern regions with a magnetic field B$\sim$100 $\mu$G or
higher. Depending on the exact magnetic field amplitude, the TeV emission could
arise from either the South region (IC dominated) or the interaction region
($\pi^{o}$ decay dominated).

Title:Constraining the Milky Way halo kinematics via its Linear Response to the Large Magellanic Cloud,"
Abstract:  We model the response of spherical, non-rotating Milky Way (MW) dark matter
and stellar halos to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the matrix method
of linear response theory. Our computations reproduce the main features of the
dark halo response from simulations. We show that these features can be well
separated by a harmonic decomposition: the large scale over/underdensity in the
halo (associated with its reflex motion) corresponds to the $\ell=1$ terms, and
the local overdensity to the $\ell\geq2$ multipoles. Moreover, the dark halo
response is largely dominated by the first order 'forcing' term, with little
influence from self-gravity. This makes it difficult to constrain the
underlying velocity distribution of the dark halo using the observed response
of the stellar halo, but it allows us to investigate the response of stellar
halo models with various velocity anisotropies: a tangential (respectively
radial) halo produces a shallower (respectively stronger) response. We also
show that only the local wake is responsible for these variations, the reflex
motion being solely dependent on the MW potential. Therefore, we identify the
structure (orientation and winding) of the in-plane quadrupolar ($m=2$)
response as a potentially good probe of the stellar halo anisotropy. Finally,
our method allows us to tentatively relate the wake strength and shape to
resonant effects: the strong radial response could be associated with the inner
Lindblad resonance, and the weak tangential one with corotation.

both unobscured (Type 1) and obscured (Type 2) active galactic nuclei (AGN)
using the unprecedented spectroscopic completeness of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic
Survey (BASS) data release 2. In addition to a straightforward 1/Vmax approach,
we also compute the intrinsic distributions, accounting for sample truncation
by employing a forward modeling approach to recover the observed BHMF and ERDF.
As previous BHMFs and ERDFs have been robustly determined only for samples of
bright, broad-line (Type 1) AGNs and/or quasars, ours is the first directly
observationally constrained BHMF and ERDF of Type 2 AGN. We find that after
accounting for all observational biases, the intrinsic ERDF of Type 2 AGN is
significantly skewed towards lower Eddington ratios than the intrinsic ERDF of
Type 1 AGN. This result supports the radiation-regulated unification scenario,
in which radiation pressure dictates the geometry of the dusty obscuring
structure around an AGN. Calculating the ERDFs in two separate mass bins, we
verify that the derived shape is consistent, validating the assumption that the
ERDF (shape) is mass independent. We report the local AGN duty cycle as a
function of mass and Eddington ratio, by comparing the BASS active BHMF with
the local mass function for all SMBH. We also present the log N-log S of

Title:Response approach to the integrated shear 3-point correlation function: the impact of baryonic effects on small scales,"
Abstract:  The integrated shear 3-point correlation function $\zeta_{\pm}$ is a
higher-order statistic of the cosmic shear field that describes the modulation
of the 2-point correlation function $\xi_{\pm}$ by long-wavelength features in
the field. Here, we introduce a new theoretical model to calculate
$\zeta_{\pm}$ that is accurate on small angular scales, and that allows to take
baryonic feedback effects into account. Our model builds on the realization
that the small-scale $\zeta_{\pm}$ is dominated by the nonlinear matter
bispectrum in the squeezed limit, which can be evaluated accurately using the
nonlinear matter power spectrum and its first-order response functions to
density and tidal field perturbations. We demonstrate the accuracy of our model
by showing that it reproduces the small-scale $\zeta_{\pm}$ measured in
simulated cosmic shear maps. The impact of baryonic feedback enters effectively
only through the corresponding impact on the nonlinear matter power spectrum,
thereby permitting to account for these astrophysical effects on $\zeta_{\pm}$
similarly to how they are currently accounted for on $\xi_{\pm}$. Using a
simple idealized Fisher matrix forecast for a DES-like survey we find that,
compared to $\xi_{\pm}$, a combined $\xi_{\pm}\ \&\ \zeta_{\pm}$ analysis can
lead to improvements of order $20-40\%$ on the constraints of cosmological
parameters such as $\sigma_8$ or the dark energy equation of state parameter
$w_0$. We find similar levels of improvement on the constraints of the baryonic
feedback parameters, which strengthens the prospects for cosmic shear data to
obtain tight constraints not only on cosmology but also on astrophysical
feedback models. These are encouraging results that motivate future works on
the integrated shear 3-point correlation function towards applications to real
survey data.

Title:Hypercritical Accretion for Black Hole High Spin in Cygnus X-1,"
Abstract:  Recent observations of AdLIGO and Virgo have shown that the spin measurements
in binary black hole (BH) systems are typically small, which is consistent with
the predictions by the classical isolated binary evolution channel. In this
standard formation channel, the progenitor of the first-born BH is assumed to
have efficient angular momentum transport. The BH spins in high-mass X-ray
binaries (HMXBs), however, have been found consistently to be extremely high.
In order to explain the high BH spins, the inefficient angular momentum
transport inside the BH progenitor is required. This requirement, however, is
incompatible with the current understanding of conventional efficient angular
momentum transport mechanism. We find that this tension can be highly
alleviated as long as the hypercritical accretion is allowed. We show that, for
a case study of Cygnus X-1, the hypercritical accretion cannot only be a good
solution for the inconsistent assumption upon the angular momentum transport
within massive stars, but match its other properties reported recently.

Title:Birth of a Be star: an APOGEE search for Be stars forming through binary mass transfer,"
Abstract:  Motivated by recent suggestions that many Be stars form through binary mass
transfer, we searched the APOGEE survey for Be stars with bloated, stripped
companions. From a well-defined parent sample of 297 Be stars, we identified
one mass-transfer binary, HD 15124. The object consists of a main-sequence Be
star ($M_{\rm Be}=5.3\pm 0.6 \,M_{\odot}$) with a low-mass ($M_{\rm
donor}=0.92\pm 0.22\,M_{\odot}$), subgiant companion on a 5.47-day orbit. The
emission lines originate in an accretion disk caused by ongoing mass transfer,
not from a decretion disk as in classical Be stars. Both stars have surface
abundances bearing imprint of CNO processing in the donor's core: the surface
helium fraction is $Y_{\rm He}\approx 0.6$, and the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio is
1000 times the solar value. The system's properties are well-matched by binary
evolution models in which mass transfer begins while a $3-5\,M_{\odot}$ donor
leaves the main sequence, with the secondary becoming the Be star. These models
predict that the system will soon become a detached Be + stripped star binary
like HR 6819 and LB-1, with the stripped donor eventually contracting to become
a core helium-burning sdOB star. Discovery of one object in this short-lived
($\sim$1 Myr) evolutionary phase implies the existence of many more that have
already passed through it and are now Be + sdOB binaries. We infer that
$(28_{-16}^{+27})\,\%$ of Be stars have stripped companions, most of which are
faint. Together with the dearth of main-sequence companions to Be stars and
recent discovery of numerous Be + sdOB binaries in the UV, our results imply
that binarity plays an important role in the formation of Be stars.

Title:The high-velocity clouds above the disk of the outer Milky Way: misty precipitating gas in a region roiled by stellar streams,"
Abstract:  The high-velocity clouds (HVCs) in the outer Milky Way at $20^{\circ} < l <
190^{\circ}$ have similar spatial locations, metallicities, and kinematics.
Moreover, their locations and kinematics are coincident with several
extraplanar stellar streams. The HVC origins may be connected to the stellar
streams, either stripped directly from them or precipitated by the aggregate
dynamical roiling of the region by the stream progenitors. This paper suggests
that these HVCs are ""misty"" precipitation in the stream wakes based on the
following observations. New high-resolution (2.6 km/s) ultraviolet spectroscopy
of the QSO H1821+643 resolves what appears to be a single HVC absorption cloud
(at 7 km/s resolution) into five components with $T \lesssim 3\times 10^{4}$ K.
Photoionization models can explain the low-ionization components but require
some depletion of refractory elements by dust, and model degeneracies allow a
large range of metallicity. High-ionization absorption lines (SiIV, CIV, and
OVI) are kinematically aligned with the lower-ionization lines and cannot be
easily explained with photoionization or equilibrium collisional ionization;
these lines are best matched by non-equilibrium rapidly cooling models, i.e.,
condensing/precipitating gas, with high metallicity and a significant amount of
HI. Both the low- and high-ionization phases have low ratios of cooling time to
freefall time and cooling time to sound-crossing time, which enables
fragmentation and precipitation. The H1821+643 results are corroborated by
spectroscopy of six other nearby targets that likewise show kinematically
correlated low- and high-ionization absorption lines with evidence of dust
depletion and rapid cooling.

Title:A likely flyby of binary protostar Z CMa caught in action,"
Abstract:  Close encounters between young stellar objects in star forming clusters are
expected to dramatically perturb circumstellar disks. Such events are witnessed
in numerical simulations of star formation, but few direct observations of
ongoing encounters have been made. Here we report sub-0"".1 resolution Atacama
Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) observations
towards the million year old binary protostar Z CMa in dust continuum and
molecular line emission. A point source ~4700 au from the binary has been
discovered at both millimeter and centimeter wavelengths. It is located along
the extension of a ~2000 au streamer structure previously found in scattered
light imaging, whose counterpart in dust and gas emission is also newly
identified. Comparison with simulations shows signposts of a rare flyby event
in action. Z CMa is a ""double burster"", as both binary components undergo
accretion outbursts, which may be facilitated by perturbations to the host disk
by flybys.

Title:Resolving massive black hole binaries evolution via adaptive particle-splitting,"
Abstract:  The study of the interaction of a massive black hole binary with its gaseous
environment is crucial in order to be able to predict merger rates and possible
electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave signals. The evolution of
the binary semi-major axis resulting from this interaction has been recently
debated, and a clear consensus is still missing, also because of several
numerical limitations, i.e. fixed orbit binaries or lack of resolution inside
the cavity carved by the binary in its circumbinary disc. Using on-the-fly
particle-splitting in the 3D meshless code gizmo, we achieve hyper-Lagrangian
resolution, which allows us to properly resolve the dynamics inside the cavity,
and in particular for the first time the discs that form around the two
components of a live binary surrounded by a locally isothermal gaseous
circumbinary disc. We show that the binary orbit decays with time for very cold
and very warm discs and that the result of the interaction in the intermediate
regime is strongly in uenced by the disc viscosity as this essentially
regulates the fraction of mass contained in the discs around the binary
components as well as the fraction that is accreted by the binary. We find the
balance between these two quantities to determine whether the binary semi-major
axis decreases with time.

Title:High-Energy Neutrino Emission from Blazars,"
Abstract:  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) with relativistic jets are the most powerful
persistent astrophysical sources of electromagnetic radiation in the Universe.
Blazars are the most extreme subclass of AGN with jets directed along the line
of sight of the observer. Their high-energy photon emission dominates the
extragalactic gamma-ray sky and reaches multi-TeV energies. This demonstrates
that blazars accelerate particles to very high energies. It has long been
suspected that blazars may also accelerate protons to very high energies and
thus be cosmic neutrino sources. Being extremely rare objects in addition to
being bright, blazars are among the most readily testable neutrino candidate
source classes. Several multi-messenger monitoring campaigns have recently been
triggered in response to high-energy neutrinos observed with the IceCube
Neutrino Observatory from the direction of blazars. In this contribution, I
summarise the theoretical interpretation of these observations and give an
overview of the possible role of blazars as neutrino sources in light of the
experimental results.

Title:Exotic Compact Objects: The Dark White Dwarf,"
Abstract:  Several dark matter models allow for the intriguing possibility of exotic
compact object formation. These objects might have unique characteristics that
set them apart from their baryonic counterparts. Furthermore, gravitational
wave observations of their mergers may provide the only direct window on a
potentially entirely hidden sector. Here we discuss dark white dwarfs, starting
with an overview of the microphysical model and analytic scaling relations of
macroscopic properties derived from the non-relativistic limit. We use the full
relativistic formalism to confirm these scaling relations and demonstrate that
dark white dwarfs, if they exist, would have masses and tidal deformabilities
that are very different from those of baryonic compact objects. Further, and
most importantly, we demonstrate that dark white dwarf mergers would be
detectable by current or planned gravitational observatories across several
orders of magnitude in the particle-mass parameter space. Lastly, we find
universal relations analogous to the compactness-Love and binary Love relations
in neutron star literature. Using these results, we show that gravitational
wave observations would constrain the properties of the dark matter particles
constituting these objects.

Abstract:  A30 belongs to a class of planetary nebulae identified as ""born-again"",

factors (ADFs), likely associated with a central binary system. We present
intermediate-dispersion spectroscopy of one such feature-the J4 equatorial
knot. We confirm the apparent physical and chemical segregation of the polar
and equatorial knots observed in previous studies, and place an upper limit on
the ADF for O$^{2+}$ of 35, significantly lower than that of the polar knots.
These findings further reinforce the theory that the equatorial and polar knots

Title:Gravitational wave signal from primordial magnetic fields in the Pulsar Timing Array frequency band,"
Abstract:  The NANOGrav, Parkes, European, and International Pulsar Timing Array (PTA)
Collaborations have reported evidence for a common-spectrum process that can
potentially correspond to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in
the 1--100 nHz frequency range. We consider the scenario in which this signal
is produced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the early Universe,
induced by a nonhelical primordial magnetic field at the energy scale
corresponding to the quark confinement phase transition. We perform MHD
simulations to study the dynamical evolution of the magnetic field and compute
the resulting SGWB. We show that the SGWB output from the simulations can be
very well approximated by assuming that the magnetic anisotropic stress is
constant in time, over a time interval related to the eddy turnover time. The
analytical spectrum that we derive under this assumption features a change of
slope at a frequency corresponding to the GW source duration that we confirm
with the numerical simulations. We compare the SGWB signal with the PTA data to
constrain the temperature scale at which the SGWB is sourced, as well as the
amplitude and characteristic scale of the initial magnetic field. We find that
the generation temperature is constrained to be in the 1--200 MeV range, the
magnetic field amplitude must be $>1$\% of the radiation energy density at that
time, and the magnetic field characteristic scale is constrained to be $>10$\%
of the horizon scale. We show that the turbulent decay of this magnetic field
will lead to a field at recombination that can help to alleviate the Hubble
tension and can be tested by measurements in the voids of the Large Scale
Structure with gamma-ray telescopes like the Cherenkov Telescope Array.

Title:Assessing coincident neutrino detections using population models,"
Abstract:  Several tentative associations between high-energy neutrinos and
astrophysical sources have been recently reported, but a conclusive
identification of these potential neutrino emitters remains challenging. We
explore the use of Monte Carlo simulations of source populations to gain deeper
insight into the physical implications of proposed individual source--neutrino
associations. In particular, we focus on the IC170922A--TXS~0506+056
observation. Assuming a null model, we find a 7.6\% chance of mistakenly
identifying coincidences between $\gamma$-ray flares from blazars and neutrino
alerts in 10-year surveys. We confirm that a blazar--neutrino connection based
on the $\gamma$-ray flux is required to find a low chance coincidence
probability and, therefore, a significant IC170922A--TXS~0506+056 association.
We then assume this blazar--neutrino connection for the whole population and
find that the ratio of neutrino to $\gamma$-ray fluxes must be $\lesssim
10^{-2}$ in order not to overproduce the total number of neutrino alerts seen
by IceCube. For the IC170922A--TXS~0506+056 association to make sense, we must
either accept this low flux ratio or suppose that only some rare sub-population
of blazars is capable of high-energy neutrino production. For example, if we
consider neutrino production only in blazar flares, we expect the flux ratio of
between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-1}$ to be consistent with a single coincident
observation of a neutrino alert and flaring $\gamma$-ray blazar. These
constraints should be interpreted in the context of the likelihood models used
to find the IC170922A--TXS~0506+056 association, which assumes a fixed
power-law neutrino spectrum of $E^{-2.13}$ for all blazars.

"Title:Blue marble, stagnant lid: Could dynamic topography avert a waterworld?","
Abstract:  Topography on a wet rocky exoplanet could raise land above its sea level.
Although land elevation is the product of many complex processes, the
large-scale topographic features on any geodynamically-active planet are the
expression of the convecting mantle beneath the surface. This so-called
""dynamic topography"" exists regardless of a planet's tectonic regime or
volcanism; its amplitude, with a few assumptions, can be estimated via
numerical simulations of convection as a function of the mantle Rayleigh
number. We develop new scaling relationships for dynamic topography on stagnant
lid planets using 2D convection models with temperature-dependent viscosity.
These scalings are applied to 1D thermal history models to explore how dynamic
topography varies with exoplanetary observables over a wide parameter space.
Dynamic topography amplitudes are converted to an ocean basin capacity, the
minimum water volume required to flood the entire surface. Basin capacity
increases less steeply with planet mass than does the amount of water itself,
assuming a water inventory that is a constant planetary mass fraction. We find
that dynamically-supported topography alone could be sufficient to maintain
subaerial land on Earth-size stagnant lid planets with surface water
inventories of up to approximately $10^{-4}$ times their mass, in the most
favourable thermal states. By considering only dynamic topography, which has
~1-km amplitudes on Earth, these results represent a lower limit to the true
ocean basin capacity. Our work indicates that deterministic geophysical
modelling could inform the variability of land propensity on low-mass planets.

Title:Collisional fragmentation and bulk composition tracking in REBOUND,"
Abstract:  We present a fragmentation module and a composition tracking code for the
$n$-body code REBOUND. Our fragmentation code utilises previous semi-analytic
models and follows an implementation method similar to fragmentation for the
$n$-body code MERCURY. In our $n$-body simulations with fragmentation, we
decrease the collision and planet formation timescales by inflating the
particle radii by an expansion factor $f$ and experiment with various values of
$f$ to understand how expansion factors affect the collision history and final
planetary system. As the expansion factor increases, so do the rate of mergers
which produces planetary systems with more planets and planets at larger
orbits. Additionally, we present a composition tracking code which follows the
compositional change of homogeneous bodies as a function of mass exchange and
use it to study how fragmentation and the use of an expansion factor affects
volatile delivery to the inner terrestrial disc. We find that fragmentation
enhances radial mixing relative to perfect merging and that on average, as $f$
increases so does the average water mass fraction of the planets. Radial mixing
decreases with increasing $f$ as collisions happen early on, before the bodies
have time to grow to excited orbits and move away from their original location

Title:Fast and Flexible Analysis of Direct Dark Matter Search Data with Machine Learning,"
Abstract:  We present the results from combining machine learning with the profile
likelihood fit procedure, using data from the Large Underground Xenon (LUX)
dark matter experiment. This approach demonstrates reduction in computation
time by a factor of 30 when compared with the previous approach, without loss
of performance on real data. We establish its flexibility to capture non-linear
correlations between variables (such as smearing in light and charge signals
due to position variation) by achieving equal performance using pulse areas
with and without position-corrections applied. Its efficiency and scalability
furthermore enables searching for dark matter using additional variables
without significant computational burden. We demonstrate this by including a
light signal pulse shape variable alongside more traditional inputs such as
light and charge signal strengths. This technique can be exploited by future
dark matter experiments to make use of additional information, reduce
computational resources needed for signal searches and simulations, and make
inclusion of physical nuisance parameters in fits tractable.

laser guide star adaptive optics (AO) systems on three different telescopes.
These IR TTS benefit from the high-order loop PSF sharpening in the near

Nevertheless, these IR TTS are challenging and their use in AO is limited. In

Title:Physical Publicly Verifiable Randomness from Pulsars,"
Abstract:  We demonstrate how radio pulsars can be used as random number generators.
Specifically, we focus on publicly verifiable randomness (PVR), in which the
same sequence of trusted and verifiable random numbers is obtained by multiple
parties. PVR is a critical building block for many processes and algorithms
(including cryptography, scientific trials, electoral audits and international
treaties). However, current approaches (based on number theory) may soon become
vulnerable to quantum computers, motivating a growing demand for PVR based on
natural physical phenomena. In this context, we explore pulsars as a potential
physical PVR source. We first show that bit sequences extracted from the
measured flux densities of a bright millisecond pulsar can pass standardised
tests for randomness. We then quantify three illustrative methods of
bit-extraction from pulsar flux density sequences, using simultaneous
observations of a second pulsar carried out with the Parkes telescope in
Australia and the Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST)
in China, supported by numerical simulations. We demonstrate that the same bit
sequence can indeed be obtained at both observatories, but the ubiquitous
presence of radiometer noise needs to be accounted for when determining the
expected bit error rate between two independent sequences. We discuss our
results in the context of an imaginary use-case in which two mutually
distrusting parties wish to obtain the same random bit sequence, exploring
potential methods to mitigate against a malicious participant.

Title:Gravitational Lensing and Microlensing in Clusters: Clusters as Dark Matter Telescopes,"
Abstract:  Gravitational lensing is brightening of background objects due to deflection
of light by foreground sources. Rich clusters of galaxies are very effective
lenses because they are centrally concentrated. Such natural Gravitational
Telescopes provide us with strongly magnified galaxies at high redshifts
otherwise too faint to be detected or analyzed. With a lensing boost, we can
study galaxies shining at the end of the `Dark Ages'. We propose to exploit the
opportunity provided by the large field of view and depth, to search for
sources magnified by foreground clusters in the vicinity of the cluster
critical curves, where enhancements can be of several tens in brightness.
Another aspect is microlensing (ML), where we would like to continue our survey
of a number of Galactic globular clusters over time-scales of weeks to years to
search for ML events from planets to hypothesized central intermediate-mass
black holes (IMBH).

Title:$H$-band Temperature and Metallicity Indicators for Cool Giants: Empirical Relations in Bayesian Framework,"
Abstract:  We explored here the near-infrared $H$-band atmospheric window aiming to
provide quantitative diagnostic tools for deriving stellar parameters, for
instance, effective temperature ($T_{eff}$) and metallicity ([$Fe/H$]), of cool
giants ($T_{eff}$ $<$ 5000 K) using low-resolution spectra. We obtained 177
cool giants from the X-shooter spectral library covering a wider metallicity
range ($-$2.35 dex $<$ [$Fe/H$] $<$ 0.5 dex) than in earlier works. Degrading
the spectral resolution to R$\sim$ 1200, we estimated equivalent widths of
several important spectral features, and the behavior of spectral features with
stellar parameters are studied. Also, the empirical relations for deriving
$T_{eff}$ and [$Fe/H$] are established in the Bayesian framework. We found that
$^{12}$CO at 1.56 $\mu$m and 1.62 $\mu$m, and $^{12}$CO+MgI at 1.71 $\mu$m are
the best three $T_{eff}$ indicators with a typical accuracy of 153 K, 123 K and
107 K, respectively. The cubic Bayesian model provides the best metallicity
estimator with a typical accuracy of 0.22 dex, 0.28 dex, and 0.24 dex for FeH
at 1.62 $\mu$m, $^{12}$CO at 1.64 $\mu$m, and Fe I at 1.66 $\mu$m,
respectively. We also showed a detailed quantitative metallicity dependence of
$T_{eff}-$EWs correlations defining three metallicity groups, supersolar
([$Fe/H$] $>$ 0.0 dex), solar ($-$0.3 dex $<$ [$Fe/H$] $<$ 0.3 dex), and
subsolar ([$Fe/H$] $<$ $-$0.3 dex), from Hierarchical Bayesian modelling. The
difference between the solar and subsolar relationship is statistically
significant, but such difference is not evident between the solar and

Title:Evidence for gamma-ray emission from the remnant of Kepler's supernova based on deep H.E.S.S. observations,"
Abstract:  Observations with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have
enhanced our knowledge of nearby supernova (SN) remnants with ages younger than
500 years by establishing Cassiopeia A and the remnant of Tycho's SN as
very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources. The remnant of Kepler's SN, which is
the product of the most recent naked-eye supernova in our Galaxy, is comparable
in age to the other two, but is significantly more distant. If the gamma-ray
luminosities of the remnants of Tycho's and Kepler's SNe are similar, then the
latter is expected to be one of the faintest gamma-ray sources within reach of
the current generation IACT arrays.
Here we report evidence at a statistical level of 4.6 sigma for a VHE signal
from the remnant of Kepler's SN based on deep observations by the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) with an exposure of 152 hours. The measured
integral flux above an energy of 226 GeV is ~0.3% of the flux of the Crab
Nebula. The spectral energy distribution (SED) reveals a gamma-ray emitting
component connecting the VHE emission observed with H.E.S.S. to the emission
observed at GeV energies with Fermi-LAT. The overall SED is similar to that of
the remnant of Tycho's SN, possibly indicating the same non-thermal emission
processes acting in both these young remnants of thermonuclear SNe.

Title:Parametrization of sunspot groups based on machine learning approach,"
Abstract:  Sunspot groups observed in white-light appear as complex structures. Analysis
of these structures is usually based on simple morphological descriptors which
capture only generic properties and miss information about fine details. We
present a machine learning approach to introduce a complete yet compact
description of sunspot groups. The idea is to map sunspot group images into an
appropriate lower-dimensional (latent) space. We apply a combination of
Variational Autoencoder and Principal Component Analysis to obtain a set of 285
latent descriptors. We demonstrate that the standard descriptors are embedded
into the latent ones. Thus, latent features can be considered as an extended
description of sunspot groups and, in our opinion, can expand the possibilities
for the research on sunspot groups. In particular, we demonstrate an
application for estimation of the sunspot group complexity. The proposed
parametrization model is generic and can be applied to investigation of other
traces of solar activity observed in various spectrum lines. Key components of
this work, which are the parametrization model, dataset of sunspot groups and
latent vectors, are available in the public GitHub repository

Title:Constraining a late time transition of $G_{\rm eff}$ using low-z galaxy survey data,"
Abstract:  It has recently been pointed out that a gravitational transition taking place
at a recent redshift $z_t$, reducing the effective gravitational constant
$G_{\rm eff}$ by about $10\%$ for $z>z_t$, has the potential to lead to a
resolution of the Hubble tension if $z_t\lesssim 0.01$. Since $H(z)^2\sim
G_{\rm eff}$, such a transition would also lead to sharp change of the slope of
the Hubble diagram at $z=z_t$ and a sharp decrease in the number of galaxies
per redshift bin at $z_t$. Here we attempt to impose constraints on such a
transition by using two robust low-z redshift survey datasets ($z<0.01$), taken
from the Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) as well as the 2MASS Redshift
Survey (2MRS). In both surveys, we bin the data in redshift bins and focus on
the number of galaxies in each bin ($\Delta N(z_i)$). We observe a peak in the
distribution of galaxies near a distance of approximately 20 Mpc in both
datasets. This feature could be attributed to galactic density fluctuations, to
coherent peculiar velocities of galaxies or to an ultra late-time gravitational
transition in the same era. In the context of the later scenario we show that
this feature could have been induced by a sharp change of $G_{\rm eff}$ by
$\Delta G_{\rm eff}/G_{\rm eff} \simeq 0.6$ at $z_t\simeq 0.005$. Thus, in a
conservative approach, this method can be used to impose constraints on a
possible abrupt change of the gravitational constant taking place at very low
redshifts.

Altair (5.13 pc, type A7V, $\sim$100s Myr to $\approx$1.4 Gyr) in the Fizeau
mode with the LBT at Br-$\alpha$ (4.05 $\mu$m) and carried out angular
differential imaging to search for companions. This work presents the first
filled-aperture LBT Fizeau science dataset to benefit from a correcting mirror
which provides active phase control. In the analysis of the $\lambda/D$ angular
regime, the sensitivity of the dataset is down to $\approx$0.5 $M_{\odot}$ at
1"" for a 1.0 Gyr system. This sensitivity remains limited by the small amount
of integration time, which is in turn limited by the instability of the Fizeau
PSF. However, in the Fizeau fringe regime we attain sensitivities of $\Delta m
\approx 5$ at 0.2"" and put constraints to companions of 1.3 $M_{\odot}$ down to
an inner angle of $\approx$0.15"", closer than any previously published direct
imaging of Altair. This analysis is a pathfinder for future datasets of this
type, and represents some of the first steps to unlocking the potential of the
first ELT. Fizeau observations will be able to reach dimmer targets with

baryonic matter $\Omega_{\rm b,0}^{\rm obs}=0.0486\pm 0.0010$, we find that the

$\Omega_{\rm dm,0}^{\rm th}=\frac{1}{1+e}(1-\Omega_{\rm b,0})=0.2559$ and
$\Omega_{\rm de,0}^{\rm th}=\frac{e}{1+e}(1-\Omega_{\rm b,0})=0.6955$ in very
good agreement with the observational values $\Omega_{\rm dm,0}^{\rm

Title:Overcoming the effect of pupil distortion in multiconjugate adaptive optics,"
Abstract:  Multiconjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) systems have the potential to deliver
diffraction-limited images over much larger fields of view than traditional
single conjugate adaptive optics systems. In MCAO, the high altitude deformable
mirrors (DMs) cause a distortion of the pupil plane and lead to a dynamic
misregistration between the DM actuators and the wavefront sensors (WFSs). The
problem is much more acute for solar astronomy than for night-time observations
due to the higher spatial sampling of the WFSs and DMs, and the fact that the
science observations are often made through stronger turbulence and at lower
elevations. The dynamic misregistration limits the quality of the correction
provided by solar MCAO systems. In this paper, we present PropAO, the first AO
simulation tool (to our knowledge) to model the effect of pupil distortion. It
takes advantage of the Python implementation of the optical propagation library
PROPER. PropAO uses Fresnel propagation to propagate the amplitude and phase of
an incoming wave through the atmosphere and the MCAO system. The resulting
wavefront is analyzed by the WFSs and also used to evaluate the corrected image
quality. We are able to reproduce the problem of pupil distortion and test
novel non-linear reconstruction strategies that take the distortion into
account. PropAO is shown to be an essential tool to study the behavior of the
wavefront reconstruction and control for the European Solar Telescope.

Title:High Resolution Search for KBO Binaries from New Horizons,"
Abstract:  Using the New Horizons LORRI camera, we searched for satellites near five
Kuiper belt objects (KBOs): four cold classicals (CCs: 2011 JY31, 2014 OS393,
2014 PN70, 2011 HZ102) and one scattered disk object (SD: 2011 HK103). These
objects were observed at distances of 0.092-0.290 au from the New Horizons
spacecraft, achieving spatial resolutions of 136-430 km (resolution is ~2
camera pixels), much higher than possible from any other facilities. Here we
report that CC 2011 JY31 is a binary system with roughly equal brightness
components, CC 2014 OS393 is likely an equal brightness binary system, while
the three other KBOs did not show any evidence of binarity. The 2011 JY31
binary has a semi-major axis of 198.6 +/- 2.9 km, an orbital inclination of
61.34 +/- 1.34 deg, and an orbital period of 1.940 +/- 0.002 d. The 2014 OS393
binary objects have an apparent separation of ~150 km, making 2011 JY31 and
2014 OS393 the tightest KBO binary systems ever resolved. Both 2011 HK103 and
2011 HZ102 were detected with SNR~10, and our observations rule out equal
brightness binaries with separations larger than ~430 km and ~260 km,
respectively. The spatial resolution for 2014 PN70 was ~200 km, but this object
had SNR~2.5-3, which limited our ability to probe its binarity. The binary
frequency for the CC binaries probed in our small survey (67%, not including
2014 PN70) is consistent with the high binary frequency suggested by larger
surveys of CCs (Fraser et al. 2017, Noll et al. 2020) and recent planetesimal
formation models (Nesvorny et al. 2021), but we extend the results to smaller
orbit semi-major axes and smaller objects than previously possible.

Title:Element abundances in metal poor local star-forming galaxies constrained by the weak spectral lines,"
Abstract:  We have collected from different surveys some significant spectroscopic data
observed from star-forming galaxies in the local Universe. The objects showing
a relatively rich spectrum in number of lines from different elements were
selected in order to constrain the models. In particular, we looked at the
relatively weak lines such as [OIII]4363, HeII4686, HeI4471 and HeI5876. We
have modelled in detail the spectra by the coupled effect of photoionization
from the stars and shocks. We have found that the abundances relative to H of
most of the elements are lower than solar but not as low as those evaluated by
the direct strong line and the Te methods. Sulfur which appears through the
[SII]6717, 6731 and [SIII]6312 lines is not depleted, revealing a strong
contribution from the ISM. We have added to the sample the optical-UV spectra
of local low-metallicity dwarf galaxies containing the CIV/Hb and CIII]/Hb line
ratios in order to determine with relative precision the C/H relative
abundance. The results show He/H lower than solar in some objects and suggest
that the geometrical thickness of the clouds constrains the HeII/Hb line
ratios. We explain the low He/H by mixing of the wind from the star-forming
region with ISM clouds.

Title:Mimicking the halo-galaxy connection using machine learning,"
Abstract:  Elucidating the connection between the properties of galaxies and the
properties of their hosting haloes is a key element in galaxy formation. When
the spatial distribution of objects is also taken under consideration, it
becomes very relevant for cosmological measurements. In this paper, we use
machine learning techniques to analyse these intricate relations in the
IllustrisTNG300 magnetohydrodynamical simulation, predicting baryonic
properties from halo properties. We employ four different algorithms: extremely
randomized trees, K-nearest neighbours, light gradient boosting machine, and
neural networks, along with a unique and powerful combination of the results
from all four approaches. Overall, the different algorithms produce consistent
results in terms of predicting galaxy properties from a set of input halo
properties that include halo mass, concentration, spin, and halo overdensity.
For stellar mass, the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.98, dropping down to
0.7-0.8 for specific star formation rate (sSFR), colour, and size. In addition,
we apply, for the first time in this context, an existing data augmentation
method, synthetic minority over-sampling technique for regression with Gaussian
noise (SMOGN), designed to alleviate the problem of imbalanced data sets,
showing that it improves the overall shape of the predicted distributions and
the scatter in the halo-galaxy relations. We also demonstrate that our
predictions are good enough to reproduce the power spectra of multiple galaxy
populations, defined in terms of stellar mass, sSFR, colour, and size with high
accuracy. Our results align with previous reports suggesting that certain
galaxy properties cannot be reproduced using halo features alone.

Title:SN 2012ij: A low-luminosity type Ia supernova and evidence for continuous distribution from 91bg-like explosion to normal ones,"
Abstract:  In this paper, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of a
subluminous type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2012ij, which has an absolute $B$-band
peak magnitude $M_{B,\rm{max}}$ = $-$17.95 $\pm$ 0.15 mag. The $B$-band light
curve exhibits a fast post-peak decline with $\Delta m_{15}(B)$ = 1.86 $\pm$
0.05 mag. All the $R$ and $I$/$i$-band light curves show a weak secondary
peak/shoulder feature at about 3 weeks after the peak, like some transitional
subclass of SNe Ia, which could result from an incomplete merger of
near-infrared (NIR) double peaks. The spectra are characterized by Ti~{\sc ii}
and strong Si~{\sc ii} $\lambda$5972 absorption features that are usually seen
in low-luminosity objects like SN 1999by. The NIR spectrum before maximum light
reveals weak carbon absorption features, implying the existence of unburned
materials. We compare the observed properties of SN 2012ij with those predicted
by the sub-Chandrasekhar-mass and the Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation
models, and find that both optical and NIR spectral properties can be explained
to some extent by these two models. By comparing the secondary maximum features
in $I$ and $i$ bands, we suggest that SN 2012ij is a transitional object
linking normal SNe Ia to typical 91bg-like ones. From the published sample of
SNe Ia from the $Carnegie~Supernova~Project~II$ (CSP-II), we estimate that the
fraction of SN 2012ij-like SNe Ia is not lower than $\sim$ 2%.

Title:The Simons Observatory: Design and Measured Performance of a Carbon Fiber Strut for a Cryogenic Truss,"
Abstract:  We present the design and measured performance of a new carbon fiber strut
design that is used in a cryogenically cooled truss for the Simons Observatory
Small Aperture Telescope (SAT). The truss consists of two aluminum 6061 rings
separated by 24 struts. Each strut consists of a central carbon fiber tube
fitted with two aluminum end caps. We tested the performance of the strut and
truss by (i) cryogenically cycling and destructively pull-testing strut
samples, (ii) non-destructively pull-testing the final truss, and (iii)
measuring the thermal conductivity of the carbon fiber tubes. We found that the
strut strength is limited by the mounting fasteners and the strut end caps, not
the epoxy adhesive or the carbon fiber tube. This result is consistent with our
numerical predictions. Our thermal measurements suggest that the conductive
heat load through the struts (from 4 K to 1 K) will be less than 1 mW. This
strut design may be a promising candidate for use in other cryogenic support
structures.

Title:Organic Molecules in Insterstellar Space: Latest advances,"
Abstract:  Although first considered as too diluted for the formation of molecules
in-situ and too harsh an environment for their survival, the interstellar
medium has turned out to host a rich palette of molecular species: to date, 256
species have been identified. The last decade has seen an explosion of new
detections, including those of a number of complex organic species, which may
be dubbed as prebiotic. Organic molecules have been discovered not just in
interstellar clouds from the Solar neighbourhood, but also throughout the
Milky-Way, as well as in nearby galaxies, or some of the most distant quasars.
These discoveries were made possible by the completion of large sub-millimetre
and radio facilities. Equipped with new generation receivers, those instruments
have provided the orders of magnitude leap in sensitivity required to detect
the weak rotational lines that allowed the molecule identifications. Last two
years, 30 prebiotic molecules have been detected in TMC-1, a dust-enshrouded
gaseous cloud located at 400 light-years from the Sun in the Taurus
constellation. Ten new molecular species, have been identified in the arm of a
spiral galaxy 6 billion light-yr distant, and 12 molecular species observed in
a quasar at 11 billion light-yr. We present the latest spectral observations of
this outlying quasar and discuss the implications of those detections in these
3 archetypal sources. The basic ingredients involved in the Miller-Urey
experiment and related experiments appeared early after the formation of the
first galaxies and are widespread throughout the Universe. The chemical
composition of the gas in distant galaxies seems not much different from that
in the nearby interstellar clouds. It presumably comprises, like for TMC-1,
aromatic rings and complex organic molecules putative precursors of the RNA
nucleobases, except the lines of such species are too weak to be detected that
far.

Title:Uncertainties in Atomic Data for Modeling Astrophysical Charge Exchange Plasmas,"
Abstract:  Relevant uncertainties on theoretical atomic data are vital to determine the
accuracy of plasma diagnostics in a number of areas including in particular the
astrophysical study. We present a new calculation of the uncertainties on the
present theoretical ion-impact charge exchange atomic data and X-ray spectra
based on a set of comparisons with the existing laboratory data obtained in
historical merged-beam, cold-target recoil-ion momentum spectroscopy, and
electron beam ion traps experiments. The average systematic uncertainties are
found to be 35-88% on the total cross sections, and 57-75% on the
characteristic line ratios. The model deviation increases as the collision
energy decreases. The errors on total cross sections further induce a
significant uncertainty to the calculation of ionization balance for low
temperature collisional plasmas. Substantial improvements of the atomic
database and dedicated laboratory measurements are needed to get the current
models ready for the X-ray spectra from the next X-ray spectroscopic mission.

Title:The GW-Universe Toolbox II: constraining the binary black hole population with second and third generation detectors,"
Abstract:  We employ the method used by the GW-Universe Toolbox to generate a synthetic
catalogue of detection of stellar mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers. We
study advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Einstein Telescope (ET) as two representatives
for the 2nd and 3rd generation GW observatories, and study how GW observations
of BBHs can be used to constrain the merger rate as function of redshift and
masses. We also simulate the observations from a detector that is half as
sensitive as the ET at design which represents an early phase of ET. Two
methods are used to obtain the constraints on the source population properties
from the catalogues: 1. parametric differential merger rate model and applies a
Bayesian inference on the parameters; and 2. non-parametric and uses weighted
Kernel density estimators. The results show the overwhelming advantages of the
3rd generation detector over the 2nd generation for the study of BBH population
properties, especially at a redshifts higher than ~2, where the merger rate is
believed to peak. With the simulated aLIGO catalogue, the parametric Bayesian
method can still give some constraints on the merger rate density and mass
function beyond its detecting horizon, while the non-parametric method lose the
constraining ability completely there. We also find that, despite the numbers
of detection of the half-ET can be easily compatible with full ET after a
longer observation duration, the catalogue from the full ET can still give much
better constraints on the population properties, due to its smaller
uncertainties on the physical parameters of the GW events.

advection dominated accretion flow connected to an outer thin disk. This

physics that determines the configuration of hot and cold accreting gas, and
how the configuration varies with the accretion rate and thereby produces

Title:Understanding the phase reversals of Galactic cosmic ray anisotropies,"
Abstract:  The energy spectra and anisotropies are very important probes of the origin
of cosmic rays. Recent measurements show that complicated but very interesting
structures exist, at similar energies, in both the spectra and energy-dependent
anisotropies, indicating a common origin of these structures. Particularly
interesting phenomenon is that there is a reversal of the phase of the dipole
anisotropies, which challenges a theoretical modeling. In this work, for the
first time, we identify that there might be an additional phase reversal at
$\sim 100$ GeV energies of the dipole anisotropies as indicated by a few
underground muon detectors and the first direct measurement by the Fermi
satellite, coincident with the hundreds of GV hardenings of the spectra. We
propose that these two phase reversals, together with the energy-evolution of
the amplitudes and spectra, can be naturally explained with a nearby source
overlapping onto the diffuse background. As a consequence, the spectra and
anisotropies can be understood as the scalar and vector components of this
model, and the two reversals of the phases characterize just the competition of
the cosmic ray streamings between the nearby source and the background. The
alignment of the cosmic ray streamings along the local large-scale magnetic
field may play an important but sub-dominant role in regulating the cosmic ray
propagation. More precise measurements of the anisotropy evolution at both low
energies by space detectors and high energies by air shower experiments for
individual species will be essential to further test this scenario.

Title:A spectral survey of CH3CCH in the Hot Molecular Core G331.512-0.103,"
Abstract:  A spectral survey of methyl acetylene (CH3CCH) was conducted toward the hot
molecular core/outflow G331.512-0.103. Our APEX observations allowed the
detection of 41 uncontaminated rotational lines of CH3CCH in the frequency
range between 172-356 GHz. Through an analysis under the local thermodynamic
equilibrium assumption, by means of rotational diagrams, we determined Texc =
50 \pm 1 K, N(CH3CCH) = (7.5 \pm 0.4) x 10^{15} cm^{-2}, X[CH3CCH/H2] ~
(0.8-2.8) x 10^{-8} and X[CH3CCH/CH3OH] ~ 0.42 \pm 0.05 for an extended
emitting region (~10 arcsec). The relative intensities of the K=2 and K=3 lines
within a given K-ladder are strongly negatively correlated to the transitions'
upper J quantum-number (r=-0.84). Pure rotational spectra of CH3CCH were
simulated at different temperatures, in order to interpret this observation.
The results indicate that the emission is characterized by a non-negligible
temperature gradient with upper and lower limits of ~45 and ~60 K,
respectively. Moreover, the line widths and peak velocities show an overall
strong correlation with their rest frequencies, suggesting that the warmer gas
is also associated with stronger turbulence effects. The K=0 transitions
present a slightly different kinematic signature than the remaining lines,
indicating that they might be tracing a different gas component. We speculate
that this component is characterized by lower temperatures, and therefore
larger sizes. Moreover, we predict and discuss the temporal evolution of the
CH3CCH abundance using a two-stage zero-dimensional model of the source
constructed with the three-phase Nautilus gas-grain code.

Title:Observations of the Initial Formation and Evolution of Spiral galaxies at $1 < z < 3$ in the CANDELS fields,"
Abstract:  Many aspects concerning the formation of spiral and disc galaxies remain
unresolved, despite their discovery and detailed study over the past $150$
years. As such, we present the results of an observational search for
proto-spiral galaxies and their earliest formation, including the discovery of
a significant population of spiral-like and clumpy galaxies at $z>1$ in deep
\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} CANDELS imaging. We carry out a detailed
analysis of this population, characterising their number density evolution,
masses, star formation rates and sizes. Overall, we find a surprisingly high
overall number density of massive $M_{*} >10^{10}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$
spiral-like galaxies (including clumpy spirals) at $z > 1$ of $0.18\,{\rm
per}\, \mathrm{arcmin}^{-2}$. We measure and characterise the decline in the
number of these systems at higher redshift using simulations to correct for
redshift effects in identifications, finding that the true fraction of
spiral-like galaxies grows at lower redshifts as $\sim$ $(1+z)^{-1.1}$. This is
such that the absolute numbers of spirals increases by a factor of $\sim 10$
between $z = 2.5$ and $z = 0.5$. We also demonstrate that these spiral-like
systems have large sizes at $z>2$, and high star formation rates, above the
main-sequence, These galaxies represent a major mode of galaxy formation in the
early universe, perhaps driven by the spiral structure itself. We finally
discuss the origin of these systems, including their likely formation through
gas accretion and minor mergers, but conclude that major mergers are an
unlikely cause.

Title:GRB 211227A as a peculiar long gamma-ray burst from compact star merger,"
Abstract:  Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated with supernovae (SNe) are
believed to originate from massive star core-collapse events, whereas
short-duration GRBs that are related to compact star mergers are expected to be
accompanied by kilonovae. GRB 211227A, which lasted about 84 s, had an initial
short/hard spike followed by a series of soft gamma-ray extended emission at
redshift $z=$0.228. We performed follow-up observations of the optical emission
using BOOTES, LCOGT, and the Lijiang 2.4m telescope, but we detected no
associated supernova signature, even down to very stringent limits at such a
low redshift. We observed the host galaxy within a large error-circle and
roughly estimate the physical offset of GRB 211227A as $20.47\pm14.47$ kpc from
the galaxy center. These properties are similar to those of GRB 060614, and
suggest that the progenitor of GRB 211227A is not favored to be associated with
the death of massive stars. Hence, we propose that GRB 211227A originates from
a compact star merger. Calculating pseudo-kilonova emission for this case by
adopting the typical parameters, we find that any associated pseudo-kilonova is
too faint to be detected. If this is the case, it explains naturally the
characteristics of the prompt emission, the lack of SN and kilonova emission,
and the large physical offset from the galaxy center.

Abstract:  We present 0"".035 resolution (~200 pc) imaging of the 158 um [CII] line and
the underlying dust continuum of the z=6.9 quasar J234833.34-305410.0. The 18 h
ALMA observations reveal extremely compact emission (diameter ~1 kpc) that is
consistent with a simple, almost face-on, rotation-supported disk with a
significant velocity dispersion of ~160 km/s. The gas mass in just the central
200 pc is ~4x10^9 M_sun, about a factor two higher than that of the central
supermassive black hole. Consequently we do not resolve the black hole's sphere
of influence, and find no kinematic signature of the central supermassive black
hole. Kinematic modeling of the [CII] line shows that the dynamical mass at
large radii is consistent with the gas mass, leaving little room for a
significant mass contribution by stars and/or dark matter. The Toomre-Q
parameter is less than unity throughout the disk, and thus is conducive to star
formation, consistent with the high infrared luminosity of the system. The dust
in the central region is optically thick, at a temperature >132 K. Using
standard scaling relations of dust heating by star formation, this implies an
unprecedented high star formation rate density of >10^4 M_sun / yr / kpc^2.
Such a high number can still be explained with the Eddington limit for star
formation under certain assumptions, but could also imply that the central
supermassive black hole contributes to the heating of the dust in the central
110 pc.

Title:Maximum Temperatures in Evolving Protoplanetary Discs and Composition of Planetary Building Blocks,"
Abstract:  The maximum temperature and radial temperature profile in a protoplanetary
disc are important for the condensation of different elements in the disc. We
simulate the evolution of a set of protoplanetary discs from the collapse of
their progenitor molecular cloud cores as well as the dust decoupling within
the discs as they evolve. We show how the initial properties of the cloud cores
affect the thermal history of the protoplanetary discs using a simple viscous
disc model. Our results show that the maximum midplane temperature in the disc
occurs within 0.5 AU. It increases with the initial cloud temperature and
decreases with its angular velocity and the viscosity of the disc. From the
observed properties of the molecular cloud cores we find the median value of
the maximum temperature is around 1250 K, with roughly 90% of them being less
than 1500 K - a value that is lower than the 50% condensation temperatures of
most refractory elements. Therefore, only cloud cores with high initial
temperatures or low angular velocities and/or low viscosities within the
planet-forming discs will result in refractory-rich planetesimals. To reproduce
the volatile depletion pattern of CM, CO, and CV chondrites and the terrestrial
planets in Solar system, one must either have rare properties of the initial
molecular cloud cores like high core temperature, or other sources of energy to
heat the disc to sufficiently high temperatures. Alternatively, the volatile
depletion observed in these chondrites may be inherited from the progenitor
molecular cloud.

Title:Initial Energy of a Spatially Flat Universe -- a Hint of its Possible Origin,"
Abstract:  The evidence for a Big Bang origin of the Universe is truly compelling,
though its cause remains a complete mystery. As the cosmic spacetime is
revealed to us with ever improving detail, however, we are beginning to refine
the range of its possible initial conditions -- at least within the framework
of current physical theories. The Universe, it seems, is spatially flat, and
here we discuss in clear, straightforward terms why this trait implies a cosmos
with zero kinetic plus gravitational energy, though apparently not zero total
energy. Such an outcome has far reaching consequences because of the
possibility that the Universe may have begun its existence as a quantum
fluctuation. Was this from `nothing,' or perhaps a pre-existing vacuum? A
non-zero total energy would seemingly preclude the former scenario, but not
necessarily the latter, though this would then raise the question of how a
fluctuation with non-zero energy could have lived long enough, or
classicalized, for us to see it 13.5 billion years later. The high-precision
measurement of the Universe's spatial curvature may thus constitute the first
tangible piece of evidence impacting a possible quantum beginning.

Title:Multi-phase gas properties of extremely strong intervening DLAs towards quasars,"
Abstract:  We present the results of a spectroscopic analysis of extremely strong damped
Lyman-{\alpha} absorbers (ESDLAs, log N(Hi)>=21.7) observed with VLT-XShooter.
ESDLAs probe gas from within the star-forming disk of the associated galaxies
and thus ESDLAs provide a unique opportunity to study the interstellar medium
of galaxies at high-redshift. We report column densities (N), equivalent widths
(w), and the kinematic spread ({\Delta} v90) of species from neutral, singly
ionised, and higher ionisation species. We find that, using the dust correction
prescription, the measured metallicities are consistent for singly ionised gas
species such as Pii, S ii, Si ii, Mnii and Crii, and Znii in all ESDLAs within
3-sigma uncertainty. We find that the distributions of N(Ari)/N(Hi) ratio in
DLAs and ESDLAs are similar. We further report that ESDLAs do not show a strong
deficiency of Ari relative to other {\alpha}-capture elements as is seen in
DLAs. This supports the idea that the mentioned under-abundance of Ari in DLAs
is possibly caused by the presence of background UV photons that penetrate the
low N(Hi) clouds to ionise Ari, but they cannot penetrate deep enough in the
high N(Hi) ESDLA environment. The w(Mgii lambda2796) distribution in ESDLAs is
found to be similar to that of metal-rich Ci-selected absorbers, but the
velocity spread of their Mgii profile is different. For higher ionisation
species (such as C iv and Si iv), {\Delta} v90 is similar in the two
populations, while the {\Delta} v90 of singly ionised species is smaller for
ESDLAs. This suggests that the ESDLAs sample a different Hi region of their
associated galaxy compared to the general DLA population. We further study the
N(Cl i) distribution in high-redshift DLA and ESDLA sightlines, as Cl i is a
good tracer of H2 gas. The N(Cl i)-N(H2) correlation is followed by all the
clouds (ESDLAs and otherwise) having log N(H2)<22.

"Title:Comment on ""Locating the source field lines of Jovian decametric radio emissions"" by YuMing Wang et al","
Abstract:  In this comment of the article [arXiv:2002.01150] ""Locating the source field
lines of Jovian decametric radio emissions"" by YuMing Wang et al., 2020, we
discuss the assumptions used by the authors to compute the beaming angle of
Jupiter s decametric emissions induced by the moon Io. Their method, relying on
multi-point radio observations, was applied to a single event observed on 14th
March 2014 by Wind and both STEREO A/B spacecraft from 5 to 16 MHz, and
erroneously identified as a northern emission (Io-B type) instead of a southern
one (Io-D type). We encourage the authors to update their results with the
right hemisphere of origin and to test their method on a larger sample of
Jupiter-Io emissions.

Title:Determination of HII region metallicity in the context of estimating the primordial helium abundance,"
Abstract:  The primordial $^4$He abundance (Y$_p$) is one of the key characteristics of
Primordial Nucleosynthesis processes that occurred in the first minutes after
the Big Bang. Its value depends on the baryon/photon ratio $\eta\equiv
n_b/n_{\gamma}$, and is also sensitive to the relativistic degrees of freedom
which affect the expansion rate of the Universe at the radiation-dominated era.
The most used method of the determination of Y$_p$ is the study of the metal
deficient HII regions located in blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs). In this
paper, we discuss in detail various methods of the determination of HII region
metallicity in the context of Y$_p$ analyses. We show that some procedures used
in the methods lead to biases in the metallicity estimates and underestimation
of their uncertainties. We propose a modified method for the metallicity
determination, as well as an additional criterion for selecting objects. We
have selected 69 objects (26 objects with high quality spectra from the
HeBCD+NIR database and 43 objects from the SDSS catalog), for which we estimate
Y and O/H using the proposed method. We have estimated Y$_p=0.2470\pm0.0020$
which is one of the most accurate estimates obtained up to date. Its comparison
with the value Y$_p=0.2470\pm0.0002$ obtained as a result of numerical
modelling of Primordial Nucleosynthesis with the value of $\Omega_b$ taken from
the analysis of the CMB anisotropy (Planck mission), is an important tool for
studying the self-consistency of the Standard cosmological model (a possible
discrepancy between these estimates could be an indicator of a new physics).
The application of the proposed method allows one to more correctly estimate
Y$_p$ and the slope $d$Y/$d$(O/H). Further analysis of the data from the SDSS
catalog can significantly increase the statistics of objects for the regression
analysis, which in turn can refine the Y$_p$ estimate.

Title:Study of Goldstone Inflation in the domain of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity,"
Abstract:  Realizing the inflationary epoch driven by a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson
(pNGB) could ensure the coveted flatness, and the sub-Planckian scales related
to the dynamics of the paradigm. In this work, we have taken the most general
form of such a scenario: Goldstone inflation proposed in \cite{croon}, and
studied the model in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Natural inflation is a
limiting case of this model, is also studied here. The specific form of the EGB
coupling gives ample opportunity to study the rich phenomenology associated
with inflation as well as the reheating epoch. Predicted values of the
inflationary observables, tensor to scalar ratio ($r$), and spectral index
($n_s$) are in good agreement with the recent observations from $Planck'18$
\cite{Planck2018}. Thus, in the framework of EGB one can resurrect the model,
which otherwise needs quite a bit of fine tuning or diversion from the
canonical domain as studied in \cite{Bhattacharya:2018xlw}, to survive in the
standard cold inflationary scenario. Finally, the era of reheating is studied
for different choice of model parameters.

Title:The far-infrared/radio correlation for a sample of strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxies detected by Herschel,"
Abstract:  We investigate the radio-far infrared (FIR) correlation for a sample of $28$
bright high-redshift ($1 \lesssim z \lesssim 4$) star-forming galaxies selected
in the FIR from the Herschel-ATLAS fields as candidates to be strongly
gravitationally lensed. The radio information comes either from high
sensitivity dedicated ATCA observations at $2.1$ GHz or from cross-matches with
the FIRST survey at $1.4$ GHz. By taking advantage of source brightness
possibly enhanced by lensing magnification, we identify a weak evolution with
redshift out to $z\lesssim 4$ of the FIR-to-radio luminosity ratio $q_{\rm
FIR}$. We also find that the $q_{\rm FIR}$ parameter as a function of the radio
power $L_{1.4\,\rm GHz}$ displays a clear decreasing trend, similarly to what
is observed for optically/radio selected lensed quasars found in literature,
yet covering a complementary region in the $q_{\rm FIR}-L_{1.4\,\rm GHz}$
diagram. We interpret such a behavior in the framework of an in-situ galaxy
formation scenario, as a result of the transition from an early dust-obscured
star-forming phase (mainly pinpointed by our FIR selection) to a late
radio-loud quasar phase (preferentially sampled by the optical/radio
selection).

Title:Investigation of the Prompt SNe Ia progenitor nature through the analysis of the chemical composition of globular clusters and circumgalactic clouds,"
Abstract:  A method is proposed for determining the properties of type Ia supernovae
from short-lived precursors -- Prompt SNIa. This method is based on the
assumption that this subtype of type Ia supernovae exploded into
low-metallicity globular clusters (GCs), and is responsible for the enrichment
of the high-metallicity subgroup of GCs and circumgalactic clouds (CGCs) with
the iron peak elements. We justify that CGCs are the formation places of GCs of
both subgroups. The accuracy of the method depends, first, on the number of
GCs, the spectra of which have been studied in detail; second, on the number of
chemical elements, the abundances of which have been worked out. Only those
elements are of interest for this method that are produced in supernova
explosions and are not produced at the previous stage of the stellar evolution.
Our estimates of nucleosynthesis in low-metallicity supernova GCs are in the
best agreement with the following Prompt SNIa model: Single Degenerate Pure
Deflagration Models of white dwarfs (WDs) burning with masses in the range from
1.30 Msun to 1.31 Msun if carbon explodes in the centre of a WD with a low
central density from 0.5*10^9 g/cm^3 to 10^9 g/cm^3.

Abstract:  The Hubble UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES)
Director's Discretionary Program of low-mass pre-main-sequence stars, coupled
with forthcoming data from ALMA and JWST, will provide the foundation to
revolutionize our understanding of the relationship between young stars and
their protoplanetary disks. A comprehensive evaluation of the physics of disk
evolution and planet formation requires understanding the intricate
relationships between mass accretion, mass outflow, and disk structure. Here we
describe the Outflows and Disks around Young Stars: Synergies for the
Exploration of ULLYSES Spectra (ODYSSEUS) Survey and present initial results of
the classical T Tauri Star CVSO 109 in Orion OB1b as a demonstration of the
science that will result from the survey. ODYSSEUS will analyze the ULLYSES
spectral database, ensuring a uniform and systematic approach in order to (1)
measure how the accretion flow depends on the accretion rate and magnetic
structures, (2) determine where winds and jets are launched and how mass-loss
rates compare with accretion, and (3) establish the influence of FUV radiation
on the chemistry of the warm inner regions of planet-forming disks. ODYSSEUS
will also acquire and provide contemporaneous observations at X-ray, optical,
NIR, and millimeter wavelengths to enhance the impact of the ULLYSES data. Our
goal is to provide a consistent framework to accurately measure the level and
evolution of mass accretion in protoplanetary disks, the properties and
magnitudes of inner-disk mass loss, and the influence of UV radiation fields
that determine ionization levels and drive disk chemistry.

Title:CaRM: Exploring the chromatic Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. The cases of HD 189733b and WASP-127b,"
Abstract:  In this paper we introduce CaRM, a semi-automatic code for the retrieval of
broadband transmission spectra of transiting planets through the chromatic
Rossiter-McLaughlin method. We applied it to HARPS and ESPRESSO observations of
two exoplanets to retrieve the transmission spectrum and we analyze its fitting
transmission models. We used the strong radius dependence of the
Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect amplitude, caused by planetary companions, to
measure the apparent radius change caused by the exoplanet atmosphere. In order
to retrieve the transmission spectrum, the radial velocities, which were
computed over wavelength bins that encompass several spectral orders, were used
to simultaneously fit the Keplerian motion and the RM effect. From this, the
radius ratio was computed as a function of the wavelength, which allows one to
retrieve the low-resolution broadband transmission spectrum of a given
exoplanet. CaRM offers the possibility to use two Rossiter-McLaughlin models
taken from ARoME and PyAstronomy, associated with a Keplerian function to fit
radial velocities during transit observations automatically. Furthermore it
offers the possibility to use some methods that could, in theory, mitigate the
effect of perturbation in the radial velocities during transits. The CaRM code
allows one to retrieve the transmission spectrum of a given exoplanet using
minimal user interaction. We demonstrate that it allows one to compute the
low-resolution broadband transmission spectra of exoplanets observed using
high-resolution spectrographs such as HARPS and ESPRESSO.

Title:Intensity and Polarization Characteristics of Extended Neutron Star Surface Regions,"
Abstract:  The surfaces of neutron stars are sources of strongly polarized soft X rays
due to the presence of strong magnetic fields. Radiative transfer mediated by
electron scattering and free-free absorption is central to defining local
surface anisotropy and polarization signatures. Scattering transport is
strongly influenced by the complicated interplay between linear and circular
polarizations. This complexity has been captured in a sophisticated magnetic
Thomson scattering simulation we recently developed to model the outer layers
of fully-ionized atmospheres in such compact objects, heretofore focusing on
case studies of localized surface regions. Yet, the interpretation of observed
intensity pulse profiles and their efficacy in constraining key neutron star
geometry parameters is critically dependent upon adding up emission from
extended surface regions. In this paper, intensity, anisotropy and polarization
characteristics from such extended atmospheres, spanning considerable ranges of
magnetic colatitudes, are determined using our transport simulation. These
constitute a convolution of varied properties of Stokes parameter information
at disparate surface locales with different magnetic field strengths and
directions relative to the local zenith. Our analysis includes full general
relativistic propagation of light from the surface to an observer at infinity.
The array of pulse profiles for intensity and polarization presented highlights
how powerful probes of stellar geometry are possible. Significant
phase-resolved polarization degrees in the range of 10-60% are realized when
summing over a variety of surface field directions. These results provide an
important background for observations to be acquired by NASA's new IXPE X-ray
polarimetry mission.

Title:Magnetic imprints of eruptive and non-eruptive Solar flares as observed by Solar Dynamics Observatory,"
Abstract:  The abrupt and permanent changes of photospheric magnetic field in the
localized regions of active regions during solar flares called magnetic
imprints (MIs), have been observed for the past nearly three decades. The well
known ""coronal implosion"" model is assumed to explain such flare associated
changes but the complete physical understanding is still missing and debatable.
In this study, we made a systematic analysis of flare-related changes of
photospheric magnetic field during 21 flares (14 eruptive and 7 non-eruptive)
using the high-cadence (\texttt{135s}) vector-magnetogram data obtained from
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. The MI regions for eruptive flares are found
to be strongly localised, whereas the majority of non-eruptive events
($>70~\%$) have scattered imprint regions. To quantify the strength of the MIs,
we derived the integrated change of horizontal field and total change of
Lorentz force over an area. These quantities correlate well with the flare
strength, irrespective of whether flares being eruptive or not, short or long
duration. Further, the free-energy (FE), determined from virial-theorem
estimates, exhibits statistically significant downward trend which starts
around the flare time is observed in majority of flares. The change of FE
during flares do not depend on eruptivity but have a strong positive
correlation ($\approx 0.8$) with the Lorentz force change, indicating that the
part of FE released would penetrate into the photosphere. While these results
strongly favor the idea of significant feedback from corona on the photospheric
magnetic field, the characteristics of MIs are quite indistinguishable for
flares being eruptive or not.

Title:Spatially resolved star-formation relations of dense molecular gas in NGC 1068,"
Abstract:  We analyse the influence of the dynamical environment on the star formation
(SF) relations of the dense molecular gas in the starburst (SB) ring of the
Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. We used ALMA to image the emission of the 1-0
transitions of HCN and HCO+ with a resolution of 56 pc. We also used ancillary
data of CO(1-0) at a resolution of ~100 pc, and CO(3-2) and its underlying
continuum emission at ~40 pc. These observations allow us to probe a range of
molecular gas densities (n(H2)~10$^{3-5}cm^{-3}$). The SF rate (SFR) is derived
from Pa$\alpha$ line emission imaged by HST/NICMOS. We analysed how SF
relations change depending on the choice of aperture sizes and molecular gas
tracer. The scatter in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation is about a factor of two
to three lower for the HCN and HCO+ lines compared to CO(1-0) for a common
aperture. Correlations lose statistical significance below a critical spatial
scale $\approx$300-400 pc. The SF efficiency of the dense molecular gas
(SFEdense) shows a scattered distribution as a function of the HCN luminosity
(L'(HCN)) around a mean value of $\simeq0.01$Myr$^{-1}$. An alternative
prescription for SF relations, linking the SFEdense and the boundedness of the
gas measured by the parameter b$\equiv\Sigma$dense/$\sigma^2$, where
$\Sigma$dense is the dense molecular gas surface density and $\sigma$ the
velocity dispersion, resolves the degeneracy associated with the
SFEdense-L'(HCN) plot. We identify two branches in the SFEdense-b plot that
correspond to two dynamical environments in the SB ring, which are defined by
their proximity to the bar-ring interface region. This region corresponds to
the crossing of two density wave resonances, where an increased rate of
cloud-cloud collisions would favour an enhanced compression of molecular gas.
Our results suggest that galactic dynamics plays a major role in the efficiency
of the gas conversion into stars.

Abstract:  TIC137608661/TYC4544-2658-1/FBS0938+788 is a new sdBV+dM reflection-effect
binary discovered by the TESS space mission with an orbital period of 7.21
hours. In addition to the orbital frequency and its harmonics, the Fourier
transform of TIC137608661 shows many g-mode pulsation frequencies from the sdB
star. The amplitude spectrum is particularly simple to interpret as we
immediately see several rotational triplets of equally spaced frequencies. The
central frequencies of these triplets are equally spaced in period with a mean
period spacing of 270.12 s, corresponding to consecutive l=1 modes. From the
mean frequency spacing of 1.25 {\mu}Hz we derive a rotation period of 4.6 days
in the deep layers of the sdB star, significantly longer than the orbital
period. Among the handful of sdB+dM binaries for which the sdB rotation was
measured through asteroseismology, TIC137608661 is the non-synchronized system
with both the shortest orbital period and the shortest core rotation period.
Only NY Vir has a shorter orbital period but it is synchronized. From a
spectroscopic follow-up of TIC137608661 we measure the radial velocities of the
sdB star, determine its atmospheric parameters, and estimate the rotation rate
at the surface of the star. This measurement allows us to exclude synchronized
rotation also in the outer layers and suggests a differential rotation, with
the surface rotating faster than the core, as found in few other similar
systems. Furthermore, an analysis of the spectral energy distribution of
TIC137608661, together with a comparison between sdB pulsation properties and
asteroseismic models, gives us further elements to constrain the system.

Sun and is described in two different analytical models yielding consistent

sufficiently far from the Sun. The difficulty of detecting this force is

spacecraft missions. Its effect on the Pioneer and New Horizons spacecrafts is
discussed. A future mission is discussed that may be able to detect this force.
Implications of this force are discussed with its impact for problems in

Title:Galaxy Zoo: Clump Scout: Surveying the Local Universe for Giant Star-forming Clumps,"
Abstract:  Massive, star-forming clumps are a common feature of high-redshift
star-forming galaxies. How they formed, and why they are so rare at low
redshift, remains unclear. In this paper we identify the largest yet sample of
clumpy galaxies (7,052) at low redshift using data from the citizen science
project \textit{Galaxy Zoo: Clump Scout}, in which volunteers classified over
58,000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies spanning redshift $0.02 < z <
0.15$. We apply a robust completeness correction by comparing with simulated
clumps identified by the same method. Requiring that the ratio of
clump-to-galaxy flux in the SDSS $u$ band be greater than 8\% (similar to clump
definitions used by other works), we estimate the fraction of local galaxies
hosting at least one clump ($f_{clumpy}$) to be $2.68_{-0.30}^{+0.33}\%$. We
also compute the same fraction with a less stringent cut of 3\%
($11.33_{-1.16}^{+0.89}\%$), as the higher number count and lower statistical
noise of this fraction permits sharper comparison with future low-redshift
clumpy galaxy studies. Our results reveal a sharp decline in $f_{clumpy}$ over
$0 < z < 0.5$. The minor merger rate remains roughly constant over the same
span, so we suggest that minor mergers are unlikely to be the primary driver of
clump formation. Instead, the rate of galaxy turbulence is a better tracer for
$f_{clumpy}$ over $0 < z < 1.5$ for galaxies of all masses, which supports the
idea that clump formation is primarily driven by violent disk instability for
all galaxy populations during this period.

Title:Do the majority of stars form as gravitationally unbound?,"
Abstract:  Some of the youngest stars (age $\lesssim 10$ Myr) are clustered, while many
others are observed scattered throughout star forming regions or in complete
isolation. It has been intensively debated whether the scattered or isolated
stars originate in star clusters, or if they form truly isolated, which could
help constrain the possibilities how massive stars are formed. We adopt the
assumption that all stars form in gravitationally bound star clusters embedded
in molecular cloud cores ($\Gamma$-$1\;$ model), which expel their natal gas,
and compare the fraction of stars found in clusters with observational data.
The star clusters are modelled by the code nbody6, which includes stellar and
circumbinary evolution, gas expulsion, and the external gravitational field of
their host galaxy. We find that small changes in the assumptions in the current
theoretical model estimating the fraction, $\Gamma$, of stars forming in
embedded clusters have a large influence on the results, and we present a
counterexample as an illustration. This calls into question theoretical
arguments about $\Gamma$ in embedded clusters, and it suggests that there is no
firm theoretical ground for low $\Gamma$ in galaxies with lower star formation
rates (SFRs). Instead, the assumption that all stars form in embedded clusters
is in agreement with observational data for the youngest stars (age $\lesssim
10$ Myr). In the $\Gamma$-$1\;$ scenario, the observed fraction of the youngest
stars in clusters increases with the SFR only weakly; the increase is caused by
the presence of more massive clusters in galaxies with higher SFRs, which
release fewer stars to the field in proportion to their mass. The
$\Gamma$-$1\;$ model yields a higher fraction of stars in clusters for older
stars (age between $10$ and $300$ Myr) than what is observed. This discrepancy
can be caused by interactions with molecular clouds.

Title:Accelerated growth of seed black holes by dust in the early universe,"
Abstract:  We explore the effect of dust on the growth of seed black holes (BHs) in the
early universe. Previous 1D radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations show that
increased radiation pressure on dust further suppresses the accretion rate than
the case for the chemically pristine gas. Using the Enzo+Moray code, we perform
a suite of 3D RHD simulations of accreting BHs in a dusty interstellar medium
(ISM). We use the modified Grackle cooling library to consider dust physics in
its non-equilibrium chemistry. The BH goes through an early evolutionary phase,
where ionizing BH radiation creates an oscillating HII region as it cycles
between accretion and feedback. As the simulations proceed, dense cold gas
accumulates outside the ionized region where inflow from the neutral medium
meets the outflow driven by radiation pressure. In the late phase, high-density
gas streams develop and break the quasi-spherical symmetry of the ionized
region, rapidly boosting the accretion rate. The late phase is characterized by
the coexistence of strong ionized outflows and fueling high-density gas
inflows. The mean accretion rate increases with metallicity reaching a peak at
Z$\sim$0.01-0.1$\,Z_\odot$, one order of magnitude higher than the one for
pristine gas. However, as the metallicity approaches the solar abundance, the
mean accretion rate drops as the radiation pressure becomes strong enough to
drive out the high-density gas. Our results indicate that a dusty metal-poor
ISM can accelerate the growth rate of BHs in the early universe, however, can
stun its growth as the ISM is further enriched toward the solar abundance.

Title:EMPRESS. VII. Ionizing Spectrum Shapes of Extremely Metal-Poor Galaxies: Uncovering the Origins of Strong HeII and the Impact on Cosmic Reionization,"
Abstract:  Strong high-ionization lines such as HeII of young galaxies are puzzling at
high and low redshift. Although recent studies suggest the existence of
non-thermal sources, whether their ionizing spectra can consistently explain
multiple major emission lines remains a question. Here we derive the general
shapes of the ionizing spectra for three local extremely metal-poor galaxies
(EMPGs) that show strong HeII$\lambda$4686. We parameterize the ionizing
spectra composed of a blackbody and power-law radiation mimicking various
stellar and non-thermal sources. We use photoionization models for nebulae, and
determine seven parameters of the ionizing spectra and nebulae by Markov Chain
Monte Carlo methods, carefully avoiding systematics of abundance ratios. We
obtain the general shapes of ionizing spectra explaining $\sim 10$ major
emission lines within observational errors with smooth connections from
observed X-ray and optical continua. We find that an ionizing spectrum of one
EMPG has a blackbody-dominated shape, while the others have convex downward
shapes at $>13.6$ eV, which indicate a diversity of the ionizing spectrum
shapes. We confirm that the convex downward shapes are fundamentally different
from ordinary stellar spectrum shapes, and that the spectrum shapes of these
galaxies are generally explained by the combination of the stellar and
ultra-luminous X-ray sources. Comparisons with stellar synthesis models suggest
that the diversity of the spectrum shapes arises from differences in the
stellar age. If galaxies at $z\gtrsim 6$ are similar to the EMPGs, high energy
($>54.4$ eV) photons of the non-stellar sources negligibly contribute to cosmic
reionization due to relatively weak radiation.

Abstract:  Dwarf galaxies are the least massive, most abundant, and most widely

stellar components studied in detail are of particular interest, because their
properties and their evolution can be inferred with accuracy. This Review
summarizes what is known of the stellar and chemical properties of star-forming

content and ongoing star formation, these objects are supposed to resemble the
first galaxies that formed at the earliest epochs, and may thus represent a
window on the distant, early Universe. We describe the major results obtained

formation and evolution of star-forming dwarfs, and the uncertainties still

assign a morphological class for each source. Our results indicate that the

strong correlation between optical and radio properties of these sources. Also,
we found that young AGNs can be hosted by elliptical, spiral and interacting

Abstract:  We present a search for associated HI 21 cm absorption in a sample of 29
radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at $0.7 < z < 1$, carried out with the
upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. We detect HI 21 cm absorption against
none of our target AGNs, obtaining $3\sigma$ upper limits to the optical depth
of $\lesssim$ 1% per 50 km s$^{-1}$ channel. The radio luminosity of our
sources is lower than that of most AGNs searched for HI 21 cm absorption at
similar redshifts in the literature, and, for all targets except two, the UV
luminosity is below the threshold $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, above which the HI in
the AGN environment has been suggested to be completely ionised. We stacked the
HI spectra to obtain a more stringent limit of $\approx 0.17$% per 50 km
s$^{-1}$ channel on the average HI 21 cm optical depth of the sample. The
sample is dominated by extended radio sources, 24 of which are extended on
scales of tens of kiloparsecs. Including similar extended sources at $0.7 < z <
1.0$ from the literature, and comparing with a low-$z$ sample of extended radio
sources, we find statistically significant ($\approx 3\sigma$) evidence that
the strength of HI 21 cm absorption towards extended radio sources is weaker at
$0.7<z<1.0$ than at $z < 0.25$, with a lower detection rate of HI 21 cm
absorption at $0.7 < z < 1.0$. Redshift evolution in the physical conditions of
HI is the likely cause of the weaker associated HI 21 cm absorption at high
redshifts, due to either a low HI column density or a high spin temperature in
high-$z$ AGN environments.

Title:Time-domain deep learning filtering of structured atmospheric noise for ground-based millimeter astronomy,"
Abstract:  The complex physics involved in atmospheric turbulence makes it very
difficult for ground-based astronomy to build accurate scintillation models and
develop efficient methodologies to remove this highly structured noise from
valuable astronomical observations. We argue that a Deep Learning approach can
bring a significant advance to treat this problem because of deep neural
networks' inherent ability to abstract non-linear patterns over a broad scale
range. We propose an architecture composed of long-short term memory cells and
an incremental training strategy inspired by transfer and curriculum learning.
We develop a scintillation model and employ an empirical method to generate a
vast catalog of atmospheric noise realizations and train the network with
representative data. We face two complexity axes: the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and the degree of structure in the noise. Hence, we train our recurrent
network to recognize simulated astrophysical point-like sources embedded in
three structured noise levels, with a raw-data SNR ranging from 3 to 0.1. We
find that a slow and repetitive increase in complexity is crucial during
training to obtain a robust and stable learning rate that can transfer
information through different data contexts. We probe our recurrent model with
synthetic observational data, designing alongside a calibration methodology for
flux measurements. Furthermore, we implement a traditional matched filtering
(MF) to compare its performance with our neural network, finding that our final
trained network can successfully clean structured noise and significantly
enhance the SNR compared to raw data and in a more robust way than traditional
MF.

Title:Building Terrestrial Planets: Why results of perfect-merging simulations are not quantitatively reliable approximations to accurate modeling of terrestrial planet formation,"
Abstract:  Although it is accepted that perfect-merging is not a realistic outcome of
collisions, some researchers state that perfect-merging simulations can still
be considered as quantitatively reliable representations of the final stage of
terrestrial planet formation. Citing the work of Kokubo & Genda [ApJL, 714L,
21], they argue that the differences between the final planets in simulations
with perfect-merging and those where collisions are resolved accurately are
small, and it is, therefore, justified to use perfect-merging results as an
acceptable approximation to realistic simulations. In this paper, we show that
this argument does not stand. We demonstrate that when the mass lost during
collisions is taken into account, the final masses of the planets will be so
different from those obtained from perfect-merging that the latter cannot be
used as a valid approximation. We carried out a large number of SPH simulations
of embryo-embryo collisions and determined the amount of the mass and water
lost in each impact. We applied the results to collisions in a typical
perfect-merging simulation and showed that even when the mass-loss in each
collision is as small as 10%, perfect-merging can, on average, overestimate the
masses of the final planets by $\sim 35\%$ and their water-contents by more
than 18%. Our analysis demonstrates that, while perfect-merging simulations are
still a powerful tool in proving concepts, they cannot be used to make
predictions, draw quantitative conclusions (especially about the past history
of a planetary system) and serve as a valid approximation to, or in lieu of the
simulations in which collisions are resolved accurately.

Title:Spatial Structures in the Globular Cluster Distribution of Fornax Cluster Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We report the discovery of statistically significant spatial structures in
the projected two-dimensional distributions of the Globular Cluster (GC)
systems of 10 among the brightest galaxies in the Fornax Cluster. We use a
catalog of GCs extracted from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera
for Surveys (ACS) Fornax Cluster Survey (ACSFCS) imaging data. We characterize
the size, shape and location relative to the host galaxies of the GC structures
and suggest a classification based on their morphology and location that is
suggestive of different formation mechanisms. We also investigate the GC
structures in the context of the positions of their host galaxies relative to
the general spatial distributions of galaxies and intra-cluster globular
clusters in the Fornax Cluster. We finally estimate the dynamical masses of the
progenitors of some GC structures, under the assumption that they are the
relics of past accretion events of satellite galaxies by their hosts.

Title:Double-power-law feature of energetic particles accelerated at coronal shocks,"
Abstract:  Recent observations have shown that in many large solar energetic particle
(SEP) events the event-integrated differential spectra resemble double power
laws. We perform numerical modeling of particle acceleration at coronal shocks
propagating through a streamer-like magnetic field by solving the Parker
transport equation, including protons and heavier ions. We find that for all
ion species the energy spectra integrated over the simulation domain can be
described by a double power law, and the break energy depends on the ion
charge-to-mass ratio as $E_B \sim (Q/A)^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ varying from
0.16 to 1.2 by considering different turbulence spectral indices. We suggest
that the double power law distribution may emerge as a result of the
superposition of energetic particles from different source regions where the
acceleration rates differ significantly due to particle diffusion. The
diffusion and mixing of energetic particles could also provide an explanation
for the increase of Fe/O at high energies as observed in some SEP events.
Although further mixing processes may occur, our simulations indicate that
either power-law break or rollover can occur near the Sun and predict that the
spectral forms vary significantly along the shock front, which may be examined
by upcoming near-Sun SEP measurements from Parker Solar Probe and Solar
Orbiter.

Title:Constraints on Population I/II neutron star-black hole binary formation by gravitational wave and radio observations,"
Abstract:  Two neutron star (NS)-black hole (BH) binaries, GW200105 and GW200115 found
in the LIGO/Virgo O3b run have smaller BH mass of 6--9\,$M_{\odot}$ which is
consistent with Population I and II origin. Our population synthesis
simulations using $10^6$ Population I and II binaries with appropriate initial
parameters show consistent binary mass, event rate, and no detection of radio
pulsar (PSR) and BH binaries in our galaxy so far. Especially, we found
possible progenitors of GW200105 and GW200115 which were formed at redshift
$z=0.15$ and $z=1.6$ with binary mass of $(34M_{\odot},\, 9.2M_{\odot})$ and
$(23.7M_{\odot},\, 10.6M_{\odot})$, respectively. The final masses of these
binaries are $(6.85M_{\odot},\,2.14M_{\odot})$ and
$(6.04M_{\odot},\,1.31M_{\odot})$ which look like
$(9.0_{-1.7}^{+1.7}M_{\odot},\, 1.91_{-0.24}^{+0.33}M_{\odot})$ of GW200105 and
$(5.9_{-2.5}^{+2.0}M_{\odot},\,1.44_{-0.29}^{+0.85}M_{\odot})$ of GW200115,
respectively. We also estimate that 2.68-19.7 PSR-BH binaries in our galaxy
will be observed by SKA. The existence of NS-BHs in our galaxy can be confirmed
in future SKA era. Using the GW observation of NS-BH mergers and the radio
observation of PSR-BHs in future, we can get more severe constraints on the
NS-BH formation process.

Title:A Material-based Panspermia Hypothesis: The Potential of Polymer Gels and Membraneless Droplets,"
Abstract:  The Panspermia hypothesis posits that either life's building blocks
(molecular Panspermia) or life itself (organism-based Panspermia) may have been
interplanetary transferred to facilitate the Origins of Life (OoL) on a given
planet, complementing several current OoL frameworks. Although many spaceflight
experiments were performed in the past to test for potential terrestrial
organisms as Panspermia seeds, it is uncertain whether such organisms will
likely ""seed"" a new planet even if they are able to survive spaceflight.
Therefore, rather than using organisms, using abiotic chemicals as seeds has
been proposed as part of the molecular Panspermia hypothesis. Here, as an
extension of this hypothesis, we introduce and review the plausibility of a
polymeric material-based Panspermia seed (M-BPS) theoretical concept, where the
type of polymeric material that can function as a M-BPS must be able to: 1)
survive spaceflight, and 2) ""function"", i.e., contingently drive chemical
evolution towards some form of abiogenesis once arriving on a foreign planet.
We use polymeric gels as a model example of a potential M-BPS. Polymeric gels
that can be prebiotically synthesized on one planet (such as polyester gels)
could be transferred to another planet via meteoritic transfer, where upon
landing on a liquid bearing planet, can assemble into structures containing
cellular-like characteristics and functionalities. Such features presupposed
that these gels can assemble into compartments through phase separation to
accomplish relevant functions such as encapsulation of primitive metabolic,
genetic and catalytic materials, exchange of these materials, motion,
coalescence, and evolution. All of these functions can result in the gels'
capability to alter local geochemical niches on other planets, thereby allowing
chemical evolution to lead to OoL events.

Title:Machine learning prediction for mean motion resonance behaviour -- The planar case,"
Abstract:  Most recently, machine learning has been used to study the dynamics of
integrable Hamiltonian systems and the chaotic 3-body problem. In this work, we
consider an intermediate case of regular motion in a non-integrable system: the
behaviour of objects in the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Neptune. We show
that, given initial data from a short 6250 yr numerical integration, the
best-trained artificial neural network (ANN) can predict the trajectories of
the 2:3 resonators over the subsequent 18750 yr evolution, covering a full
libration cycle over the combined time period. By comparing our ANN's
prediction of the resonant angle to the outcome of numerical integrations, the
former can predict the resonant angle with an accuracy as small as of a few
degrees only, while it has the advantage of considerably saving computational
time. More specifically, the trained ANN can effectively measure the resonant
amplitudes of the 2:3 resonators, and thus provides a fast approach that can
identify the resonant candidates. This may be helpful in classifying a huge
population of KBOs to be discovered in future surveys.

"Title:On the Evolution of Seyfert galaxies, BL Lacertae objects and Flat-spectrum radio quasars","
Abstract:  The concept of the evolutionary sequence of jetted active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) has been challenged in the last few decades since AGN subclasses are
considered to be different due to their viewing angle. In this paper, we
collected a sample of 1108 blazars (472 flat-spectrum radio quasars, FSRQs and
636 BL Lacertae objects, BL Lacs) and 120 Seyfert galaxies (SGs) with available
redshifts and spectral properties in radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands
in order to compare the properties of SGs and the blazar subclasses and also
explore their possible unification through evolution. It is found that the
ratio of the relative difference of SGs and the blazar subclasses are
approximately the same implying that they have an evolutionary relationship. We
discovered from the results of a two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K.S.)
test, that the probabilities (p) for the composite spectral indices:
optical-X-ray radio-X-ray radio-optical and X-ray-gamma-ray to come from the
same parent population is p, less than 0.05, implying that the null hypothesis
cannot be rejected, thus, supports SGs-BL Lacs-FSRQs evolutionary
sequence................. These results agree with the prediction that SGs have
an evolutionary relationship with the blazar subclasses.

Title:The sunspot number record supports the existence of Planet 9 and the effect of planetary motion on solar activity,"
Abstract:  This paper assesses if the Planet 9 hypothesis, the existence of a ninth
planet, is consistent with the planetary hypothesis, the synchronization of
sunspot emergence to solar inertial motion (SIM) induced by the planets. We
show that SIM would be profoundly affected if Planet 9 exists and that the
hypothesized effect of SIM on sunspot emergence would be radically different
from the effect of SIM due to the existing eight planets. We compare the
spectral and time variation of Sun to barycentre distance, RB, calculated for
both the eight and nine planet systems, with variation of sunspot number (SSN).
Including Planet 9 improves spectral correlation and time coherence between RB
and SSN in the decadal, centennial and millennial time range. Additionally, as
the variation of RB is sensitive to Planet 9 parameters, longitude and period,
it is possible to tune both parameters to SSN variation and obtain new
estimates of the Planet 9 parameters independent of astronomical observations.
We develop a mechanism for the influence of SIM on SSN that provides an
explanation of the consistency between SIM, calculated with Planet nine, and
records of reconstructed SSN.

Title:Discovery of Three Candidate Magnetar-powered Fast X-ray Transients from Chandra Archival Data,"
Abstract:  It was proposed that a remnant stable magnetar could be formed in a binary
neutron-star merger, leading to a fast X-ray transient (FXT) that can last for
thousands of seconds. Recently, Xue et al. suggested that CDF-S XT2 was exactly
such a kind of source. If confirmed, such emission can be used to search for
electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events from binary
neutron-star mergers that have short gamma-ray bursts and the corresponding
afterglows seen off-axis and thus too weak to be detected. Here we report the
discovery of three new FXTs, XRT 170901, XRT 030511, and XRT 110919, from
preliminary search over Chandra archival data. Similar to CDF-S XT2, these new
FXTs had a very fast rise (less than a few ten seconds) and a plateau of X-ray
flux $\sim$$1.0\times10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ lasting for 1-2 ks,
followed by a steep decay. Their optical/IR counterparts, if present, are very
weak, arguing against a stellar flare origin for these FXTs. For XRT 170901, we
identified a faint host galaxy with the source at the outskirts, very similar
to CDF-S XT2. Therefore, our newly discovered FXTs are also strong candidates
for magnetar-powered X-ray transients resulting from binary neutron star
mergers.

Abstract:  We present a mock catalog of gravitationally lensed quasars at
$z_\text{qso}<7.5$ with simulated images for the Rubin Observatory Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We adopt recent measurements of quasar
luminosity functions to model the quasar population, and use the CosmoDC2 mock
galaxy catalog to model the deflector galaxies, which successfully reproduces
the observed galaxy velocity dispersion functions up to $z_d\sim1.5$. The mock
catalog is highly complete for lensed quasars with Einstein radius
$\theta_E>0\farcs07$ and quasar absolute magnitude $M_{i}<-20$. We estimate
that there are $\sim10^3$ lensed quasars discoverable in current imaging
surveys, and LSST will increase this number to $\sim2.4\times10^3$. Most of the
lensed quasars have image separation $\Delta \theta>0\farcs5$, which will at
least be marginally resolved in LSST images with seeing of $\sim0\farcs7$.
There will be $\sim200$ quadruply-lensed quasars discoverable in the LSST. The
fraction of quad lenses among all discoverable lensed quasars is about
$\sim10\%-15\%$, and this fraction decreases with survey depth. This mock
catalog shows a large diversity in the observational features of lensed
quasars, in terms of lensing separation and quasar-to-deflector flux ratio. We
discuss possible strategies for a complete search of lensed quasars in the LSST
era.

Title:Galactic and Extragalactic Sources of Very High Energy Gamma-rays,"
Abstract:  Very high energy {\gamma}-rays are one of the most important messengers of
the non-thermal Universe. The major motivation of very high energy {\gamma}-ray
astronomy is to find sources of high energy cosmic rays. Several astrophysical
sources are known to accelerate cosmic rays to very high energies under extreme
conditions. Very high energy {\gamma}-rays are produced at these astrophysical
sites or near through interactions of cosmic rays in the surrounding medium
close to the sources. Gamma-rays, being neutral, travel in a straight line and
thus give us valuable information about the cosmic ray sources and their
surroundings. Additionally, very high energy {\gamma}-ray astronomy can probe
many fundamental physics questions. Ground-based {\gamma}-ray astronomy began
its journey in 1989 when Whipple telescope detected TeV {\gamma}-rays from the
Crab, a pulsar wind nebula in the Milky Way. In the last two decades,
technological improvements have facilitated the development of the latest
generation of very high energy detectors and telescopes which have delivered
exciting new results. Until now over two hundred very high energy {\gamma}-ray
sources, both galactic and extra-galactic has been detected. These observations
have provided a deeper insight into a large number of important questions in
high energy astrophysics and astroparticle physics. This review article is an
attempt to enumerate the most important results in the exciting and rapidly
developing field of very high energy {\gamma}-ray astronomy.

Title:Implicit correlations within phenomenological parametric models of the neutron star equation of state,"
Abstract:  The rapid increase in the number and precision of astrophysical probes of
neutron stars in recent years allows for the inference of their equation of
state. Observations target different macroscopic properties of neutron stars
which vary from star to star, such as mass and radius, but the equation of
state allows for a common description of all neutron stars. To connect these
observations and infer the properties of dense matter and neutron stars
simultaneously, models for the equation of state are introduced. Parametric
models rely on carefully engineered functional forms that reproduce a large
array of realistic equations of state. Such models benefit from their
simplicity but are limited because any finite-parameter model cannot accurately
approximate all possible equations of state. Nonparametric models overcome this
by increasing model freedom at the cost of increased complexity. In this study,
we compare common parametric and nonparametric models, quantify the limitations
of the former, and study the impact of modeling on our current understanding of
high-density physics. We show that parametric models impose strongly
model-dependent, and sometimes opaque, correlations between density scales.
Such interdensity correlations result in tighter constraints that are
unsupported by data and can lead to biased inference of the equation of state
and of individual neutron star properties.

Title:The extent of ionization in simulations of radio-loud AGNs impacting kpc gas discs,"
Abstract:  We use the results of relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of jet-ISM
interactions in a galaxy with a radio-loud AGN to quantify the extent of
ionization in the central few kpcs of the gaseous galactic disc. We perform
post-process radiative transfer of AGN radiation through the simulated gaseous
jet-perturbed disc to estimate the extent of photo-ionization by the AGN with
an incident luminosity of $10^{45}~\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. We also map the gas
that is collisionally ionized due to shocks driven by the jet. The analysis was
carried out for simulations with similar jet power
($10^{45}~\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) but different jet orientations with respect to
the gas disc. We find that the shocks from the jets can ionize a significant
fraction (up to 33$\%$) of dense gas ($n>100\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) in the disc,
and that the jets clear out the central regions of gas for AGN radiation to
penetrate to larger distances in the disc. Jets inclined towards the disc plane
couple more strongly with the ISM and ionize a larger fraction of gas in the
disc as compared to the vertical jet. However, similar to previous studies, we
find that the AGN radiation is quickly absorbed by the outer layers of dense
clouds in the disc, and is not able to substantially ionize the disc on a
global scale. Thus, compared to jet-ISM interactions, we expect that
photo-ionization by the AGN radiation only weakly affects the star-formation
activity in the central regions of the galactic disc ($\lesssim 1$ kpc),
although the jet-induced shocks can spread farther out.

Title:Buildup of the Magnetic Flux Ropes in Homologous Solar Eruptions,"
Abstract:  Homologous coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are an interesting phenomenon, and
it is possible to investigate the formation of CMEs by comparing multi-CMEs
under a homologous physical condition. AR 11283 had been present on the solar
surface for several days when a bipole emerged on 2011 September 4. Its
positive polarity collided with the pre-existing negative polarity belonging to
a different bipole, producing recurrent solar activities along the polarity
inversion line (PIL) between the colliding polarities, namely the so-called
collisional PIL (cPIL). Our results show that a large amount of energy and
helicity were built up in the form of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs), with
recurrent release and accumulation processes. These MFRs were built up along
the cPIL. A flux deficit method is adopted and shows that magnetic cancellation
happens along the cPIL due to the collisional shearing scenario proposed by
Chintzoglou et al. The total amount of canceled flux was
$\sim$0.7$\times$10$^{21}$ Mx with an uncertainty of $\sim$13.2$\%$ within the
confidence region of the 30$^\circ$ sun-center distance. The canceled flux
amounts to 24$\%$ of the total unsigned flux of the bipolar magnetic region.
The results show that the magnetic fields beside the cPIL are very sheared, and
the average shear angle is above 70$^\circ$ after the collision. The fast
expansion of the twist kernels of the MFRs and the continuous eruptive
activities are both driven by the collisional shearing process. These results
are important for better understanding the buildup process of the MFRs
associated with homologous solar eruptions.

model slightly favors the phantom regime. We show that the big tension between
the low- and high-redshift observations appearing in CDM universe to predict
the Hubble constant H 0 can be alleviated in NGCG model. However, from the
statistical point of view, our results show that the standard CDM model fits

integrated (backwards and forward) the orbits of 119 objects with reliable
positions and proper motions. In calculations, we adopted a realistic
axisymmetric Galactic potential (bulge + disk + halo). Using different impact
conditions, we found five pairs of the GCs that likely experienced collisions:
Terzan 3 - NGC 6553, Terzan 3 - NGC 6218, Liller 1 - NGC 6522, Djorg 2 - NGC
6552 and NGC 6355 - NGC 6637. We analyzed the GCs interaction rates with the
central supermassive black hole. Assuming the maximum 100 pc distance criteria
for separation between them we estimated 11 close encounter events. From our
numerical simulations, we estimate the close interaction rate as at least one
event per Gyr with the impact parameter less than 30 pc; and one event per Myr
with the impact parameter less than 60 pc. Our calculations show one very close
encounter of NGC 6121 with the central SMBH near 5.5 pc (practically direct

Abstract:  Using the observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory, we study an eruption

pre-eruptive structure is visible mainly in EUV 131 $\mathring{\mathrm{A}}$
images with two highly-sheared loop structures. They undergo slow rise motion
and then reconnect to form an eruptive hot-channel as in the tether-cutting
reconnection model. The J-shaped flare-ribbons trace the footpoint of the FR
which is identified as the hot-channel. Initially, the hot channel is observed
to rise slowly at 40 km s$^{-1}$, followed by an exponential rise from 22:55 UT
at a coronal height of 87$\pm$2 Mm. Following the onset of the eruption at
23:00 UT, the flare-reconnection adds to the acceleration process of the CME
within 3 R$_\odot$. Later on, the CME continues to accelerate at 8 m s$^{-2}$
during its propagation period. Further, the eruption launched type-II followed
by III, IVm radio bursts. The start and end times of type-IVm correspond to the
CME core height of 1.5 and 6.1 R$_\odot$, respectively. Also the spectral index
is negative suggesting the non-thermal electrons trapped in the closed loop
structure. Accompanied with type-IVm, this event is unique in the sense that
the flare ribbons are very clearly observed along with the erupting hot
channel, which strongly supports that the hooked-part of J-shaped flare ribbons
outlines the boundary of the erupting FR.

Title:A Novel Approach to Topological Graph Theory with R-K Diagrams and Gravitational Wave Analysis,"
Abstract:  Graph Theory and Topological Data Analytics, while powerful, have many
drawbacks related to their sensitivity and consistency with TDA & Graph Network

vectorized associations between data points for the purpose of enabling smooth
transitions between Graph and Topological Data Analytics. We conclusively
reveal effective ways of converting such vectorized associations to simplicial

specific, homotopic self-expressive, event-driven unique topological signatures
which we have referred as Roy-Kesselman Diagrams or R-K Diagrams with
persistent homology, which emerge from filter-based encodings of R-K Models.
The validity and impact of this approach were tested specifically on
high-dimensional raw and derived measures of Gravitational Wave Data from the
latest LIGO datasets published by the LIGO Open Science Centre along with
testing a generalized approach for a non-scientific use-case, which has been
demonstrated using the Tableau Superstore Sales dataset. We believe the
findings of our work will lay the foundation for many future scientific and

Title:Integrated trispectrum detection from BOSS DR12 NGC CMASS,"
Abstract:  We present the first detection of the integrated trispectrum
($\mathit{i}$-trispectrum) monopole and quadrupoles signal from BOSS CMASS NGC
DR12. Extending the FKP estimators formalism to the Fourier transform of the
four-point correlation function, we test shot-noise subtraction, Gaussianity of
the i-trispectrum data-vector, significance of the detection and similarity
between the signal from the data and from the galaxy mock catalogues used to
numerically estimate the covariance matrix. Using scales corresponding to modes
from minimum $k_\mathrm{min}=0.03\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$ to maximum
$k_\mathrm{min}=0.15\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$, we find a detection in terms of distance
from the null hypothesis of $(10.4,5.2,8.3,1.1,3.1)$ $\sigma$-intervals for the
i-trispectrum monopole and quadrupoles respectively. This quantifies the
presence of the physical signal of the four-points statistics on BOSS data. For
completeness the same analysis is also performed for power spectrum and
bispectrum, both monopoles and quadrupoles.

Title:AMICal Sat: A sparse RGB imager on board a 2U cubesat to study the aurora,"
Abstract:  AMICal sat, a dedicated 2U cubesat, has been developed, in order to monitor
the auroral emissions, with a dedicated imager. It aims to help to reconstruct
the low energy electrons fluxes up to 30 keV in Earth auroral regions. It
includes an imager entirely designed in Grenoble University Space Center. The
imager uses a 1.3 Mpixels sparse RGB CMOS detector and a wide field objective
(f=22.5 mm). The satellite platform has been built by the polish company
Satrevolution. Launched September, 3rd, 2020 from Kuru (French Guyana) on board
the Vega flight 16, it produces its first images in October 2020. The aim of
this paper is to describe the design of the payload especially the optics and
the proximity electronics, to describe the use of the payload for space weather
purpose. A preliminary analysis of a first image showing the relevance of such
an instrument for auroral monitoring is performed. This analysis allowed to
reconstruct from one of the first images the local electron input flux at the
top of the atmosphere during the exposure time.

Title:Why hot Jupiters can be large but not too large,"
Abstract:  Tidal heating is often used to interpret ""radius anomaly"" of hot Jupiters
(i.e. radii of a large fraction of hot Jupiters are in excess of 1.2 Jupiter
radius which cannot be interpreted by the standard theory of planetary
evolution). In this paper we find that tidal heating induces another phenomenon
""runaway inflation"" (i.e. planet inflation becomes unstable and out of control
when tidal heating rate is above its critical value). With sufficiently strong
tidal heating, luminosity initially increases with inflation, but across its
peak it decreases with inflation such that heating is stronger than cooling and
runaway inflation occurs. In this mechanism, the opacity near
radiative-convective boundary (RCB) scales approximately as temperature to the
fourth power and heat cannot efficiently radiate away from planet interior,
which induces runaway inflation (similar to a tight lid on a boiling pot).
Based on this mechanism, we find that radii of hot Jupiters cannot exceed
$2.2R_J$, which is in good agreement with the observations. We also give an
upper limit for orbital eccentricity of hot Jupiters. Moreover, by comparison
to the observations we infer that tidal heating locates near RCB.

Title:Investigating the dynamical models of cosmology with recent observations and upcoming gravitational-wave data,"
Abstract:  We explore and compare the capabilities of the recent observations of
standard cosmological probes and the future observations of gravitational-wave
(GW) standard sirens on constraining cosmological parameters. It is carried out
in the frameworks of two typical dynamical models of cosmology, i.e., the
$\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model with $\omega(z) = \omega_0 +\omega_a*z/(1+z)$, and
the $\xi$-index model with $\rho_X\propto\rho_ma^{\xi}$, where $\omega(z)$ is
the dark energy equation of state, and $\rho_X$ and $\rho_m$ are the energy
densities of dark energy and matter, respectively. In the cosmological
analysis, the employed data sets include the recent observations of the
standard cosmological probes, i.e., Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB), and also the
mock GW standard siren sample with 1000 merging neutron star events anticipated
from the third-generation detectors. In the scenarios of both
$\omega_0\omega_a$CDM and $\xi$-index models, it turns out that the mock GW
sample can reduce the uncertainty of the Hubble constant $H_0$ by about 50\%
relative to that from the joint SNe+BAO+CMB sample; nevertheless, the
SNe+BAO+CMB sample demonstrates better performance on limiting other
parameters. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence is applied to compare the
dynamical models with the $\Lambda$CDM model. The Bayesian evidences computed
from the SNe+BAO+CMB sample reveal that the $\Lambda$CDM model is the most
supported one; moreover, the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model is more competitive
than the $\xi$-index model.

Title:Seismic modeling of a very young SPB star -- KIC8264293,"
Abstract:  KIC8264293 is a fast rotating B-type pulsator observed by Kepler satellite.
Its photometric variability is mainly due to pulsations in high-order g modes.
Besides, we detected a weak H$\alpha$ emission. Thus, the second source of
variability is the fluctuation in a disk around the star. The pulsational
spectrum of KIC8264293 reveals a frequency grouping and period spacing pattern.
Here, we present the thorough seismic analysis of the star based on these
features. Taking into account the position of the star in the HR diagram and
fitting the 14 frequencies that form the period spacing we constrain the
internal structure of the star. We conclude that the star barely left the ZAMS
and the best seismic model has $M = 3.54\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$,
$V_\mathrm{rot}=248\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $Z = 0.0112$. We found the upper
limit on the mixing at the edge of the convective core, with the overshooting
parameter up to $f_\mathrm{ov} = 0.03$. On the other hand, we were not able to
constrain the envelope mixing for the star. To excite the modes in the observed
frequency range, we had to modify the opacity data. Our best seismic model with
an opacity increase by 100% at the ""nickel"" bump $\log T=5.46$ explains the
whole instability. KIC8264293 is the unique, very young star pulsating in
high-order g modes with the Be feature. However, it is not obvious whether the
source of this circumstellar matter is the ejection of mass from the underlying
star or whether the star has retained its protostellar disk.

"Title:Using Computational Models to Uncover the Parameters of Three Kepler Binaries: KIC 5957123, KIC 8314879, and KIC 10727668","
Abstract:  Theories of stellar convective core overshoot can be examined through
analysis of pulsating stars. Better accuracy can be achieved by obtaining
external constraints such as those provided by observing pulsating stars in
eclipsing binary systems, but this requires that the binary parameters be
identified so photometric variations of the pulsating component may be isolated
from the binary periodicity. This study aims to uncover the physical parameters
of three binaries observed by the Kepler spacecraft. We also seek to evaluate
the feasibility of accurately constraining binaries using only readily
available time-series photometry and distance estimates. Binary models were
constructed using the Physics of Eclipsing Binaries (PHOEBE) software package.
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were used to sample the parameter space of
these models and provide estimates of the posterior distributions for these
systems. An initial run using binned light curve data was performed to identify
general parameter trends and provide initializing distributions for a
subsequent analysis incorporating the full data set. We present theoretical
models for all three binaries, along with posterior distributions from our MCMC
analyses. Models for KIC 8314879 and KIC 10727668 produced a good match to the
observed data, while the model of KIC 5957123 failed to generate an appropriate
synthetic light curve. For the two successful models, we interpret the
posterior distributions and discuss confidence in our parameter estimates and
uncertainties. We also evaluate the feasibility of this procedure in various
contexts, and propose several modifications to improve the success of future
studies.

Abstract:  We report the first detection in the ${\it J}_{\it K}$ = 1$_{0}$ - 0$_{0}$
rotational transition line of CH$_{3}$D towards three Class 0/I proto-brown
dwarfs (proto-BDs) from IRAM 30 m observations. Assuming a rotational
temperature of 25 K, the CH$_{3}$D abundances (relative to H$_{2}$) are in the
range of (2.3--14.5) $\times$ 10$^{-7}$. The CH$_{4}$ abundances derived from
the CH$_{3}$D abundances and assuming the DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$ ratios are in the
range of (0.05--4.8) $\times $10$^{-5}$. The gas-phase formation of CH$_{3}$D
via CH$_2$D$^+$ is enhanced at high densities of 10$^{8}$--10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$
and our observations are likely probing the innermost dense and warm regions in
proto-BDs. Thermal and/or non-thermal desorption can return the CH$_{3}$D and
CH$_{4}$ molecules formed at an early stage on grain surfaces to the gas-phase.
The gas phase abundances are indicative of warm carbon-chain chemistry in
proto-BDs where carbon-chain molecules are synthesized in a lukewarm
($\sim$20-30 K) region close to the central source.

Title:Testing dark energy after pre-recombination early dark energy,"
Abstract:  In the studies on pre-recombination early dark energy (EDE), the evolution of
Universe after recombination is usually regarded as ${\Lambda}CDM$-like, which
corresponds that the equation of state of dark energy responsible for current
accelerated expansion is $w=-1$. However, in realistic models, $w$ might be
evolving. We consider the parametrizations of $w$ with respect to the redshift
$z$ in Axion-like EDE and AdS-EDE models, respectively. We performed the Monte
Carlo Markov chain analysis with recent cosmological data, and found that the
bestfit $w(z)$ is compatible with $w_0=-1,w_a=0$ (the cosmological constant)
and the evolution of $w$ is only marginally favored, which so has little effect
on lifting the bestfit value of ${H_0}$.

Title:A Principal Component Analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission in NGC 7023,"
Abstract:  We carried out a principal component analysis (PCA) of the fluxes of five
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.0, and 11.2
$\mu$m in the reflection nebula NGC 7023 comprising of the photodissociation
region (PDR) and a cavity. We find that only two principal components (PCs) are
required to explain the majority of the observed variance in PAH fluxes (98 %).
The first PC ($PC_{1}$), which is the primary driver of the variance,
represents the total PAH emission. The second PC ($PC_{2}$) is related to the
ionization state of PAHs across the nebula. This is consistent with the results
of a similar analysis of the PAH emission in NGC 2023. The biplots and the
correlations of PCs with the various PAH ratios show that there are two subsets
of ionic bands with the 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m bands forming one subset and the 8.6
and 11.0 $\mu$m bands the other. However, the distinction between these subsets
is only present in the PDR. We have also carried out a separate PCA analysis of
the PAH fluxes, this time only considering variations in the cavity. This shows
that in the cavity, $PC_{2}$ is not related to the charge state of PAHs, but
possibly to structural molecular changes.

Title:Dynamics of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes Wandering in the Milky Way Galaxy Using the Illustris TNG50 Simulation,"
Abstract:  The detection of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies is
crucial to closing the gap in the wide mass distribution of black holes ($\sim
3 \, \rm M_{\odot}$ to $\sim 5 \times 10^{10} \, \rm M_{\odot}$). IMBHs
originally located at the center of dwarfs that later collide with the Milky
Way (MW) could be wandering, undetected, in our Galaxy. We used TNG50, the
highest-resolution run of the IllustrisTNG project, to study the kinematics and
dynamics of star clusters, in the appropriate mass range, acting as IMBH
proxies in a MW analog galaxy. We showed that $\sim 87\%$ of our studied IMBHs
drift inward. The radial velocity of these sinking IMBHs has a median magnitude
of $\sim 0.44 \, \rm ckpc \, h^{-1} \, Gyr^{-1}$ and no dependence on the black
hole mass. The central $1 \, \rm ckpc \, h^{-1}$ has the highest number density
of IMBHs in the galaxy. A physical toy model with linear drag forces was
developed to explain the orbital circularization with time. These findings
constrain the spatial distribution of IMBHs, suggesting that future searches
should focus on the central regions of the Galaxy. Additionally, we found that
the 3D velocity distribution of IMBHs with respect to the galactic center has a
mean of $\sim 180 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$ and larger variance with decreasing
radius. Remarkably, the velocity distribution relative to the local gas shows
significantly lower values, with a mean of $\sim 88 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$. These
results are instrumental for predicting the accretion and radiation properties
of IMBHs, facilitating their detection with future surveys.

Title:Hot-mode accretion and the physics of thin-disk galaxy formation,"
Abstract:  We use FIRE simulations to study disk formation in z~0, Milky Way-mass
galaxies, and conclude that a key ingredient for the formation of thin stellar
disks is the ability for accreting gas to develop an aligned angular momentum
distribution via internal cancellation *prior* to joining the galaxy. Among
galaxies with a high fraction (>70%) of their young stars in a thin disk
(h/R~0.1) we find that: (i) hot, virial-temperature gas dominates the inflowing
gas mass on halo scales (>~20 kpc), with radiative losses offset by compression
heating; (ii) this hot accretion proceeds until angular momentum support slows
inward motion, at which point the gas cools to T~10^4 K or less; (iii) prior to
cooling, the accreting gas develops an angular momentum distribution that is
aligned with the galaxy disk, and while cooling transitions from a
quasi-spherical spatial configuration to a more flattened, disk-like
configuration. We show that the existence of this ""rotating cooling flow""
accretion mode is strongly correlated with the fraction of stars forming in a
thin disk among a sample of 17 z~0 galaxies spanning a halo mass range of
10^10.5 solar masses to 10^12 solar masses, or a stellar mass range 10^8 solar
masses to 10^11 solar masses. Notably, galaxies with a thick disk or irregular
morphology do not undergo significant angular momentum alignment of gas prior
to accretion and show no correspondence between halo gas cooling and
flattening. Our results suggest that rotating cooling flows (or, more
generally, rotating subsonic flows) that become coherent and angular
momentum-supported prior to accretion onto the galaxy are likely a necessary
condition for the formation of thin, star-forming disk galaxies in a LambdaCDM
universe.

Title:Constraints on Single-Field Inflation from the BOSS Galaxy Survey,"
Abstract:  Non-local primordial non-Gaussianity (NLPNG) is a smoking gun of interactions
in single-field inflationary models, and can be written as a combination of the
equilateral and orthogonal templates. We present the first constraints on these
from the redshift-space galaxy power spectra and bispectra of the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data. These are the first such
measurements independent of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. We
perform a consistent analysis that includes all necessary nonlinear corrections
generated by NLPNG, and vary all relevant cosmological and nuisance parameters
in a global fit to the data. Our conservative analysis yields joint limits on
the amplitudes of the equilateral and orthogonal shapes, $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm
equil}=940\pm 600$, $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm ortho}= -170\pm 170$ (both at 68\% CL).
These can be used to derive constraints on coefficients of the effective
single-field inflationary Lagrangian; in particular, we find that the sound
speed of inflaton fluctuations has the bound $c_s\geq 0.013$ at 95\% CL. Fixing
the quadratic galaxy bias and cosmological parameters, the constraints can be
tightened to $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}=260\pm 300$, $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm ortho}=
-23\pm 120$ (68\% CL).

the major breakthroughs in modern cosmology. Several cosmological probes (CMB,
SNe Ia, BAO) have been studied in depth to better understand the nature of the
mechanism driving this acceleration, and they are being currently pushed to
their limits, obtaining remarkable constraints that allowed us to shape the
standard cosmological model. In parallel to that, however, the percent
precision achieved has recently revealed apparent tensions between measurements
obtained from different methods. These are either indicating some unaccounted
systematic effects, or are pointing toward new physics. Following the
development of CMB, SNe, and BAO cosmology, it is critical to extend our
selection of cosmological probes. Novel probes can be exploited to validate
results, control or mitigate systematic effects, and, most importantly, to
increase the accuracy and robustness of our results. This review is meant to
provide a state-of-art benchmark of the latest advances in emerging
beyond-standard cosmological probes. We present how several different methods

cosmic chronometers, quasars, gamma-ray bursts, standard sirens, lensing
time-delay with galaxies and clusters, cosmic voids, neutral hydrogen intensity
mapping, surface brightness fluctuations, secular redshift drift, and
clustering of standard candles. The review describes the method, systematics,
and results of each probe in a homogeneous way, giving the reader a clear

75 Virgo cluster late-type galaxies, including all those with a star formation
rate >~ 1 M_{sun}/yr and a representative sample of the less star-forming ones.
This study is based on 110 observations obtained over 20 years with the Chandra
X-ray Observatory Advanced Camera for Imaging Spectroscopy. As part of a Large
Chandra Program, new observations were obtained for 52 of these 75 galaxies.
The data are complete to a sensitivity of about 10^{39} erg/s, with a typical
detection limit of about 3 x 10^{38} erg/s for the majority of the sources. The
catalogue contains about 80 ULXs (0.3-10 keV luminosity >10^{39} erg/s), and
provides their location, observed flux, de-absorbed luminosity, and (for the 25
most luminous ones) simple X-ray spectral properties. We discuss the ULX
luminosity function in relation to the mass and star formation rate of the
sample galaxies. We show that recent models of low-mass plus high-mass X-ray
binary populations (scaling with stellar mass and star formation rate,
respectively) are mostly consistent with our observational results. We
tentatively identify the most luminous X-ray source in the sample (a source in
IC 3322A with L_{X} ~ 6 x 10^{40} erg/s) as a recent supernova or its young
remnant. The properties of the sample galaxies (morphologies, stellar masses,
star formation rates, total X-ray luminosities from their point-source
population) are also summarised.

Title:Mechanical feedback from stellar winds with an application to galaxy formation at high redshift,"
Abstract:  We compute different sets of stellar evolutionary tracks in order to quantify
the energy, mass, and metals yielded by massive main-sequence and
post-main-sequence winds. Our aim is to investigate the impact of binary
systems and of a metallicity-dependent distribution of initial rotational
velocities on the feedback by stellar winds. We find significant changes
compared to the commonly used non-rotating, single-star scenario. The largest
differences are noticeable at low metallicity, where the mechanical-energy
budget is substantially increased. So as to establish the maximal (i.e.
obtained by neglecting dissipation in the near circumstellar environment)
influence of winds on the early stages of galaxy formation, we use our new
feedback estimates to simulate the formation and evolution of a sub-$L_*$
galaxy at redshift 3 (hosted by a dark-matter halo with a mass of $1.8\times
10^{11}$ M$_\odot$) and compare the outcome with simulations in which only
supernova (SN) feedback is considered. Accounting for the continuous energy
injection by winds reduces the total stellar mass, the metal content, and the
burstiness of the star-formation rate as well as of the outflowing gas mass.
However, our numerical experiment suggests that the enhanced mechanical
feedback from the winds of rotating and binary stars has a limited impact on
the most relevant galactic properties compared to the non-rotating single-star
scenario. Eventually, we look at the relative abundance between the metals
entrained in winds and those ejected by SNe and find that it stays nearly
constant within the simulated galaxy and its surrounding halo.

Title:Photometry on Structured Backgrounds: Local Pixelwise Infilling by Regression,"
Abstract:  Photometric pipelines struggle to estimate both the flux and flux uncertainty
for stars in the presence of structured backgrounds such as filaments or
clouds. However, it is exactly stars in these complex regions that are critical
to understanding star formation and the structure of the interstellar medium.
We develop a method, similar to Gaussian process regression, which we term
local pixelwise infilling (LPI). Using a local covariance estimate, we predict
the background behind each star and the uncertainty on that prediction in order
to improve estimates of flux and flux uncertainty. We show the validity of our
model on synthetic data and real dust fields. We further demonstrate that the
method is stable even in the crowded field limit. While we focus on optical-IR
photometry, this method is not restricted to those wavelengths. We apply this
technique to the 34 billion detections in the second data release of the Dark
Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS2). In addition to removing many $>3\sigma$
outliers and improving uncertainty estimates by a factor of $\sim 2-3$ on
nebulous fields, we also show that our method is well-behaved on uncrowded
fields. The entirely post-processing nature of our implementation of LPI
photometry allows it to easily improve the flux and flux uncertainty estimates
of past as well as future surveys.

Title:A galaxy-free phenomenological model for the 21-cm power spectrum during reionization,"
Abstract:  Upper limits from the current generation of interferometers targeting the
21-cm signal from high redshifts have recently begun to rule out physically
realistic, though still extreme, models of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR).
While inferring the detailed properties of the first galaxies is one of the
most important motivations for measuring the high-$z$ 21-cm signal, they can
also provide useful constraints on the properties of the intergalactic medium
(IGM). Motivated by this, we build a simple, phenomenological model for the
21-cm power spectrum that works directly in terms of IGM properties, which
bypasses the computationally expensive 3-D semi-numerical modeling generally
employed in inference pipelines and avoids explicit assumptions about galaxy
properties. The key simplifying assumptions are that (i) the ionization field
is binary, and composed of spherical bubbles with an abundance described well
by a parametric bubble size distribution, and (ii) that the spin temperature of
the ``bulk'' IGM outside bubbles is uniform. Despite the simplicity of the
model, the mean ionized fraction and spin temperature of the IGM recovered from
mock 21-cm power spectra generated with \textsc{21cmfast} are generally in good
agreement with the true input values. This suggests that it is possible to
obtain comparable constraints on the IGM using models with very different
assumptions, parameters, and priors. Our approach will thus be complementary to
semi-numerical models as upper limits continue to improve in the coming years.

"Title:Towards a More Complete Optical Census of Active Galactic Nuclei, Via Spatially-Resolved Spectroscopy","
Abstract:  While emission-line flux ratio diagnostics are the most common technique for
identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in optical spectra, applying this
approach to single fiber spectra of galaxies can omit entire subpopulations of
AGNs. Here, we use spatially resolved spectroscopy from the Mapping Nearby
Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey to construct a sample of 10
galaxies where Baldwin-Philips-Terlevich line flux ratio diagnostics classify
each galaxy's central $3^{\prime\prime}$ spectrum as LINER or star forming,
while $>10\%$ of the spaxels in the galaxy's MaNGA footprint are classified as
Seyfert. We obtain Chandra observations of these 10 galaxies with off-nuclear
Seyfert regions to determine whether AGNs are actually present in them. Our
main result is that 7-10 (depending on strictness of criteria) of the galaxies
host one or more X-ray AGNs, even though none of them were classified as AGNs
based on their single-fiber optical spectra. We find that these AGNs were not
identified in the single-fiber spectra because they are AGNs in the nuclei of
companion galaxies, low luminosity AGNs, dust obscured AGNs, and/or flickering
AGNs. In summary, we find that off-nuclear AGN signatures may increase the
number of known AGNs by a factor of two over what conventional single nuclear
fiber spectra identify. Our results show that spatially resolved spectroscopy
can be leveraged to reveal a more complete census of AGNs that are
traditionally missed by single fiber spectra.

in M 101, 4XMM J140314.2$+$541806 (henceforth, J1403), using Chandra and
XMM-Newton data. Over the last two decades, J1403 has shown short-duration
outbursts with an X-ray luminosity $\sim1-3 \times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and
longer intervals at luminosities $\sim0.5-1 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The
bimodal behaviour and fast outburst evolution (sometimes only a few days) are
more consistent with an accretor/propeller scenario for a neutron star than
with the canonical outburst cycles of stellar-mass black holes. If this
scenario is correct, the luminosities in the accretor and propeller states
suggest a fast spin ($P \approx$ 5 ms) and a low surface magnetic field ($B
\sim 10^{10}$ G), despite our identification of J1403 as a high-mass X-ray
binary. The most striking property of J1403 is the presence of strong
$\sim$600-s quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs), mostly around frequencies of
$\approx 1.3-1.8$ mHz, found at several epochs during the ultraluminous regime.
We illustrate the properties of such QPOs, in particular their frequency and
amplitude changes between and within observations, with a variety of techniques
(Fast Fourier Transforms, Lomb-Scargle periodograms, weighted wavelet
Z-transform analysis). The QPO frequency range $<$10 mHz is an almost
unexplored regime in X-ray binaries and ultraluminous X-ray sources. We compare
our findings with the (few) examples of very low frequency variability found in
other accreting sources, and discuss possible explanations (Lense-Thirring
precession of the inner flow or outflow; radiation pressure limit-cycle
instability; marginally stable He burning on the neutron star surface).

Title:On the origin of magnetic fields in stars II: The effect of numerical resolution,"
Abstract:  Are the kG-strength magnetic fields observed in young stars a fossil field
left over from their formation or are they generated by a dynamo? Our previous
numerical study concluded that magnetic fields must originate by a dynamo
process. Here, we continue that investigation by performing even higher
numerical resolution calculations of the gravitational collapse of a
1~M$_\odot$ rotating, magnetised molecular cloud core through the first and
second collapse phases until stellar densities are reached. Each model includes
Ohmic resistivity, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect. We test six
numerical resolutions, using between $10^5$ and $3\times10^7$ particles to
model the cloud. At all but the lowest resolutions, magnetic walls form in the
outer parts of the first hydrostatic core, with the maximum magnetic field
strength located within the wall rather than at the centre of the core. At high
resolution, this magnetic wall is disrupted by the Hall effect, producing a
magnetic field with a spiral-shaped distribution of intensity. As the second
collapse occurs, this field is dragged inward and grows in strength, with the
maximum field strength increasing with resolution. As the second core forms,
the maximum field strength exceeds 1~kG in our highest resolution simulations,
and the stellar core field strength exceeds this threshold at the highest
resolution. Our resolution study suggests that kG-strength magnetic fields may
be implanted in low-mass stars during their formation, and may persist over
long timescales given that the diffusion timescale for the magnetic field
exceeds the age of the Universe.

"Title:How the spectral energy distribution and galaxy morphology constrain each other, with application to morphological selection using galaxy colours","
Abstract:  We introduce an empirical methodology to study how the spectral energy
distribution (SED) and galaxy morphology constrain each other and implement
this on 8000 galaxies from the HST CANDELS survey in the GOODS-South field. We
show that the SED does constrain morphology and present a method that
quantifies the strength of the link between these two quantities. Two galaxies
with very similar SEDs are around three times more likely to also be
morphologically similar, with SED constraining morphology most strongly for
relatively massive red ellipticals. We apply our methodology to explore likely
upper bounds on the efficacy of morphological selection using colour. We show
that, under reasonable assumptions, colour selection is relatively ineffective
at separating homogeneous morphologies. Even with the use of up to six colours
for morphological selection, the average purity in the resultant morphological
classes is only around 60 per cent. While the results can be improved by using
the whole SED, the gains are not significant, with purity values remaining
around 70 per cent or below.

Title:Multiple Field Ultra Slow Roll Inflation: Primordial Black Holes From Straight Bulk And Distorted Boundary,"
Abstract:  We study a model of two-field ultra-slow-roll (USR) inflation bounded by a
curve in the field space. Curvature perturbations and non-Gaussianities can be
enhanced both during the USR phase and from the inhomogeneities at the
boundary. We employ the full non-linear $\delta N$ formalism to calculate the
probability distribution function (PDF) for curvature perturbation
non-perturbatively and show that the non-linear effects can significantly
enhance the abundance of the primordial black holes (PBHs). For large curvature
perturbations, the PDF has a universal exponential tail, but for the
intermediate values, the PDF -- and, therefore, the abundance of the PBHs --
depend sensitively on the geometry of the boundary.

Title:CHORUS IV: Mapping the Spatially Inhomogeneous Cosmic Reionization with Subaru HSC,"
Abstract:  The spatial inhomogeneity is one of the important features for understanding
the reionization process; however, it has not yet been fully quantified. To map
this inhomogeneous distribution, we simultaneously detect Ly$\alpha$ emitters
(LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at $z \sim 6.6$ from the Subaru/Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC) large-area ($\sim1.5\,\mathrm{ deg}^2 =
34000\,\mathrm{cMpc}^2$) deep survey. We estimate the neutral fraction,
$x_\mathrm{HI}$, from the observed number density ratio of LAEs to LBGs,
$n(\mathrm{LAE})/n(\mathrm{LBG})$ based on numerical radiative transfer
simulation, in which model galaxies are selected to satisfy the observed
selection function. While the average $x_\mathrm{HI}$ within the field of view
is found to be $x_\mathrm{HI} < 0.4$, which is consistent with previous
studies, the variation of $n(\mathrm{LAE})/n(\mathrm{LBG})$ within the field of
view for each $140\,\mathrm{pMpc}^2$ is found to be as large as a factor of
three. This may suggest a spatially inhomogeneous topology of reionization, but
it also leaves open the possibility that the variation is based on the inherent
large-scale structure of the galaxy distribution. Based on the simulations, it
may be difficult to distinguish between the two from the current survey. We
also find that LAEs in the high LAE density region are more populate high
$\mathrm{EW}_0$, supporting that the observed $n(\mathrm{LAE})/n(\mathrm{LBG})$
is more or less driven by the neutral fraction, though the statistical
significance is not high.

Title:Successive deuteration in low-mass star-forming regions: the case of D$_{2}$-methanol (CHD$_{2}$OH) in IRAS 16293-2422,"
Abstract:  Accurate quantification of the column density of di-deuterated methanol is a
key missing puzzle piece in the otherwise thoroughly constrained family of
D-bearing methanol in the deeply embedded low-mass protostellar system and
astrochemical template source IRAS16293-2422. A spectroscopic dataset for
astrophysical purposes is built for CHD$_{2}$OH and made publicly available to
facilitate accurate characterization of this species in astrochemical surveys.
The newly computed line list and partition function are used to search for
CHD$_{2}$OH towards IRAS16293-2422 A and B in data from ALMA-PILS. Only
non-blended, optically thin lines of CHD$_{2}$OH are used for the synthetic
spectral fitting. The constructed spectroscopic database contains line
frequencies and strengths for 7417 transitions in the 0 to 500 GHz frequency
range. ALMA-PILS observations in the 329-363 GHz range are used to identify 105
unique, non-blended, optically thin line frequencies of CHD$_{2}$OH for
synthetic spectral fitting. The derived excitation temperatures and column
densities yield high D/H ratios of CHD$_{2}$OH in IRAS 16293-2422 A and B of
7.5$\pm$1.1% and 7.7$\pm$1.2%, respectively. Deuteration in IRAS 16293-2422 is
not higher than in other low-mass star-forming regions. Di-deuterated molecules
consistently have higher D/H ratios than their monodeuterated counterparts in
all low-mass protostars, which may be a natural consequence of H-D substitution
reactions as seen in laboratory experiments. The Solar System's natal cloud, as
traced by comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, may have had a lower initial
abundance of D, been warmer than the cloud of IRAS16293-2422, or been partially
reprocessed. In combination with accurate spectroscopy, a careful spectral
analysis, and a consideration of the underlying assumptions, successive
deuteration is a robust window on the physicochemical provenance of
star-forming systems.

Title:A fast radio burst progenitor born in a galaxy merger,"
Abstract:  We report a Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope HI 21cm mapping study of the
neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in the host galaxy of the fast radio burst (FRB)
FRB20180916B at $z \approx 0.03399$. We find that the FRB host has an HI mass
of $\rm M_{HI} = (2.74 \pm 0.33) \times 10^9 \ M_\odot$ and a high
HI-to-stellar mass ratio, $\approx 1.3$. The FRB host is thus a gas-rich but
near-quiescent galaxy, that is likely to have acquired a significant mass of HI
in the recent past. The HI distribution is disturbed, with extended HI 21cm
emission detected in a north-eastern tail, a counter-tail towards the south, an
HI hole between the galaxy centre and the FRB location, and a high HI column
density measured close to the FRB position. The FRB host is part of a group
with four companions detected in their HI 21cm emission, the nearest of which
is only 22~kpc from the FRB location. The gas-richness and disturbed HI
distribution indicate that the FRB host has recently undergone a minor merger,
which increased its HI mass, disturbed the HI in the galaxy disk, and
compressed the HI near the FRB location to increase its surface density. We
propose that this merger caused the burst of star-formation in the outskirts of
the galaxy that gave rise to the FRB progenitor. The evidence for a minor
merger is consistent with scenarios in which the FRB progenitor is a massive
star, formed due to the merger event.

Title:Galactic Mass-to-Light Ratios With Superfluid Dark Matter,"
Abstract:  We make rotation curve fits to test the superfluid dark matter model. In
addition to verifying that the resulting fits match the rotation curve data
reasonably well, we aim to evaluate how satisfactory they are with respect to
two criteria, namely, how reasonable the resulting stellar mass-to-light ratios
are and whether the fits end up in the regime of superfluid dark matter where
the model resembles modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). We fitted the
superfluid dark matter model to the rotation curves of 169 galaxies in the
SPARC sample. We found that the mass-to-light ratios obtained with superfluid
dark matter are generally acceptable in terms of stellar populations. However,
the best-fit mass-to-light ratios have an unnatural dependence on the size of
the galaxy in that giant galaxies have systematically lower mass-to-light
ratios than dwarf galaxies. A second finding is that the superfluid often fits
the rotation curves best in the regime where the superfluid's force cannot
resemble that of MOND without adjusting a boundary condition separately for
each galaxy. In that case, we can no longer expect superfluid dark matter to
reproduce the phenomenologically observed scaling relations that make MOND
appealing. If, on the other hand, we consider only solutions whose force
approximates MOND well, then the total mass of the superfluid is in tension
with gravitational lensing data. We conclude that even the best fits with
superfluid dark matter are still unsatisfactory for two reasons. First, the
resulting stellar mass-to-light ratios show an unnatural trend with galaxy
size. Second, the fits do not end up in the regime that automatically resembles
MOND, and if we force the fits to do so, the total dark matter mass is in
tension with strong lensing data.

Title:Detection of Chemo-Kinematical Structures in Leo I,"
Abstract:  A variety of formation models for dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies have been
proposed in the literature, but these generally have not been quantitatively
compared with observations. We make use of a new spectroscopic data-set for the
Milky Way dSph Leo I, combining 288 stars observed with Magellan/IMACS and
existing Keck/DEIMOS data to provide velocity and metallicity measurements for
953 Leo I member stars. We search for chemo-dynamical patterns in this
data-set, mock galaxies consisting of pure random motions, and simulated dwarfs
formed via the dissolving star cluster and tidal stirring models. In the Leo I
data, we report the detection of 14 candidate streams of stars that may have
originated in disrupted star clusters. The angular momentum vectors of these
streams are randomly oriented, consistent with the lack of rotation in Leo I.
These results are consistent with the predictions of the dissolving cluster
model. In contrast, we find fewer candidate stream signals in mock data-sets
that lack coherent motions ~99% of the time. The chemo-dynamical analysis of
the tidal stirring simulation produces streams that share a common orientation,
which is inconsistent with the Leo~I data.

Title:Search for Spatial Correlations of Neutrinos with Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays,"
Abstract:  For several decades, the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) has
been an unsolved question of high-energy astrophysics. One approach for solving
this puzzle is to correlate UHECRs with high-energy neutrinos, since neutrinos
are a direct probe of hadronic interactions of cosmic rays and are not
deflected by magnetic fields. In this paper, we present three different
approaches for correlating the arrival directions of neutrinos with the arrival
directions of UHECRs. The neutrino data is provided by the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory and ANTARES, while the UHECR data with energies above $\sim$50 EeV
is provided by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array. All
experiments provide increased statistics and improved reconstructions with
respect to our previous results reported in 2015. The first analysis uses a
high-statistics neutrino sample optimized for point-source searches to search
for excesses of neutrinos clustering in the vicinity of UHECR directions. The
second analysis searches for an excess of UHECRs in the direction of the
highest-energy neutrinos. The third analysis searches for an excess of pairs of
UHECRs and highest-energy neutrinos on different angular scales. None of the
analyses has found a significant excess, and previously reported
over-fluctuations are reduced in significance. Based on these results, we
further constrain the neutrino flux spatially correlated with UHECRs.

Title:Deuterium chemistry and D/H ratios in Class 0/I proto-brown dwarfs,"
Abstract:  We have conducted the first extensive observational survey of several
deuterated species in 16 Class 0/I proto-brown dwarfs (proto-BDs) and 4 Class
Flat/Class II brown dwarfs. Observations were obtained with the IRAM 30m
telescope in the DCO$^{+}$ (3-2), DCN (3-2), DNC (3-2), and N$_{2}$D$^{+}$
(3-2) lines. The DCO$^{+}$/H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, DCN/H$^{13}$CN, and DNC/HN$^{13}$C
ratios are comparatively higher and show a narrower range than the
DCO$^{+}$/HCO$^{+}$, DCN/HCN, and DNC/HNC ratios, respectively. The mean D/H
ratios for the proto-BDs derived from these molecules are in the range of
$\sim$0.02-3. Both low-temperature gas-phase ion-molecule deuteron transfer and
grain surface reactions are required to explain the enhanced deuterium
fractionation. The very dense and cold ($n_{H_{2}}$ $\geq$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$, T
$\leq$10 K) interior of the proto-BDs provide the suitable conditions for
efficient deuterium fractionation in these cores. There is no correlation
between the D/H ratios and the CO depletion factor, with the exception of the
DCN/HCN ratios that show a strong anti-correlation possibly due to the
difference in the peak emitting regions of the DCN and HCN molecules. Over a
wide range in the bolometric luminosities spanning $\sim$0.002--40 L$_{\odot}$,
we find a trend of higher DCO$^{+}$/HCO$^{+}$ (r = -0.7) and DCN/HCN (r = -0.6)
ratios, nearly constant DNC/HNC (r = -0.4) and DNC/HN$^{13}$C (r = -0.1)
ratios, lower N$_{2}$D$^{+}$/N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ ratios (r = 0.6) in the proto-BDs
compared to protostars. Only one Class II brown dwarf shows emission in the
DCO$^{+}$ (3-2) line. No correlation is seen between the D/H ratios and the
evolutionary stage.

Abstract:  We report a study of the low-mass Class-0 multiple system VLA 1623AB in the
Ophiuchus star-forming region, using H$^{13}$CO$^+$ ($J=3-2$), CS ($J=5-4$),
and CCH ($N=3-2$) lines as part of the ALMA Large Program FAUST. The analysis
of the velocity fields revealed the rotation motion in the envelope and the
velocity gradients in the outflows (about 2000 au down to 50 au). We further
investigated the rotation of the circum-binary VLA 1623A disk as well as the
VLA 1623B disk. We found that the minor axis of the circum-binary disk of VLA
1623A is misaligned by about 12 degrees with respect to the large-scale outflow
and the rotation axis of the envelope. In contrast, the minor axis of the
circum-binary disk is parallel to the large-scale magnetic field according to
previous dust polarization observations, suggesting that the misalignment may
be caused by the different directions of the envelope rotation and the magnetic
field. If the velocity gradient of the outflow is caused by rotation, the
outflow has a constant angular momentum and the launching radius is estimated
to be $5-16$ au, although it cannot be ruled out that the velocity gradient is
driven by entrainments of the two high-velocity outflows. Furthermore, we
detected for the first time a velocity gradient associated with rotation toward
the VLA 16293B disk. The velocity gradient is opposite to the one from the
large-scale envelope, outflow, and circum-binary disk. The origin of its
opposite gradient is also discussed.

Title:Effects of Charge Exchange on the Evaporative Wind of HD 209458b,"
Abstract:  The role of charge exchange in shaping exoplanet photoevaporation remains a
topic of contention. Exchange of electrons between stellar wind protons from
the exoplanet's host star and neutral hydrogen from the planet's wind has been
proposed as a mechanism to create ""energetic neutral atoms"" (ENAs), which could
explain the high absorption line velocities observed in systems where mass loss
is occurring. In this paper we present results from 3D hydrodynamic simulations
of the mass loss of a planet similar to HD 209458b. We self-consistently launch
a planetary wind by calculating the ionization and heating resulting from
incident high-energy radiation, inject a stellar wind into the simulation, and
allow electron exchange between the stellar and planetary winds. We predict the
potential production of ENAs by the wind-wind interaction analytically, then
present the results of our simulations, which confirm the analytic limits.
Within the limits of our hydrodynamic simulation, we find that charge exchange
with the stellar wind properties examined here is unable to explain the
absorption observed at high Doppler velocities.

Title:Determining the Timescale over Which Stellar Feedback Drives Turbulence in the ISM: A Study of four Nearby Dwarf Irregular Galaxies,"
Abstract:  Stellar feedback is fundamental to the modeling of galaxy evolution as it
drives turbulence and outflows in galaxies. Understanding the timescales
involved are critical for constraining the impact of stellar feedback on the
interstellar medium (ISM). We analyzed the resolved star formation histories
along with the spatial distribution and kinematics of the atomic and ionized
gas of four nearby star-forming dwarf galaxies (NGC 4068, NGC 4163, NGC 6789,
UGC 9128) to determine the timescales over which stellar feedback drives
turbulence. The four galaxies are within 5 Mpc and have a range of properties
including current star formation rates of 0.0005 to 0.01 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,
log(M$_*$/M$_{\odot}$) between 7.2 and 8.2, and log(M$_{HI}$/M$_\odot$) between
7.2 and 8.3. Their Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) derived star formation
histories over the past 500 Myrs were compared to their atomic and ionized gas
velocity dispersion and HI energy surface densities as indicators of
turbulence. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to identify
any correlations between their current turbulence and their past star formation
activity on local scales ($\sim$400 pc). The strongest correlation found was
between the HI turbulence measures and the star formation rate 100-200 Myrs
ago. This suggests a coupling between the star formation activity and atomic
gas on this timescale. No strong correlation between the ionized gas velocity
dispersion and the star formation activity between 5-500 Myrs ago was found.
The sample and analysis are the foundation of a larger program aimed at
understanding the timescales over which stellar feedback drives turbulence.

"Title:Radio Spectra of Luminous, Heavily Obscured WISE-NVSS Selected Quasars","
Abstract:  We present radio spectra spanning $0.1 - 10$ GHz for the sample of heavily
obscured luminous quasars with extremely red mid-infrared-optical colors and
compact radio emission. The spectra are constructed from targeted 10 GHz
observations and archival radio survey data, which together yield $6-11$ flux
density measurements for each object. Our suite of Python tools for modeling
the radio spectra is publicly available on Github. Our primary result is that
most (61%) of the sample have peaked or curved radio spectra and many (36%)
could be classified as Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) sources. This indicates
compact emission regions likely arising from recently triggered radio jets.
Assuming synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) generates the peaks, we infer
compact source sizes ($3 - 100$ pc) with strong magnetic fields ($6 - 100$ mG)
and young ages ($30 - 10^4$ years). Conversely, free-free absorption (FFA)
could also create peaks due to the high column densities associated with the
deeply embedded nature of the sample. However, we find no correlations between
the existence or frequency of the peaks and any parameters of the MIR emission.
The high-frequency spectral indices are steep ($\alpha \approx -1$) and
correlate, weakly, with the ratio of MIR photon energy density to magnetic
energy density, suggesting that the spectral steepening could arise from
inverse Compton scattering off the intense MIR photon field. This study
provides a foundation for combining multi-frequency and mixed-resolution radio
survey data for understanding the impact of young radio jets on the ISM and
star formation rates of their host galaxies.

Title:High spatial resolution spectral imaging method for space interferometers and its application to formation-flying small satellites,"
Abstract:  Infrared space interferometers can surpass the spatial resolution limitations
of single-dish space telescopes. However, stellar interferometers from space
have not been realized because of technical difficulties. Two beams coming from
individual satellites separated by more than a few tens of meters should
precisely interfere such that the optical-path and angular differences between
the two beams are reduced at the wavelength level. Herein, we propose a novel
beam combiner for space interferometers that records the spectrally-resolved
interferometric fringes using the densified pupil spectroscopic technique. As
the detector plane is optically conjugated to a plane, on which the two beams
interfere, we can directly measure the relative phase difference between the
two beams. Additionally, when an object within the field of view is obtained
with a modest signal-to-noise ratio, we can extract the true complex amplitude
from a continuous broadband fringe (i.e., one exposure measurement), without
scanning a delay line and chopping interferometry. We discovered that this
spectral imaging method is validated for observing the solar system objects by
simulating the reflected light from Europa with a small stellar interferometer.
However, because the structure of the object spectrum may cause a systematic
error in the measurement, this method may be limited in extracting the true
complex amplitude for other astronomical objects. Applying this spectral
imaging method to general astrophysics will facilitate further research. The
beam combiner and spectral imaging method are applied to a formation-flying
stellar interferometer with multiple small satellites in a Sun-synchronous
orbit for observation of the solar system objects in visible and near-infrared.
We present an overview of SEIRIOS and the optimized optical design for a
limited-volume spacecraft.

Title:New Constraints on the Spin of the Black Hole Cygnus X-1 and the Physical Properties of its Accretion Disk Corona,"
Abstract:  We present a new analysis of NuSTAR and Suzaku observations of the black hole
Cygnus X-1 in the intermediate state. The analysis uses kerrC, a new model for
analyzing spectral and spectropolarimetric X-ray observations of black holes.
kerrC builds on a large library of simulated black holes in X-ray binaries. The
model accounts for the X-ray emission from a geometrically thin, optically
thick accretion disk, the propagation of the X-rays through the curved black
hole spacetime, the reflection off the accretion disk, and the Comptonization
of photons in coronae of different 3-D shapes and physical properties before
and after the reflection. We present the results from using kerrC for the
analysis of archival NuSTAR and Suzaku observations taken on May 27-28, 2015.
The best wedge-shaped corona gives a better fit than the cone-shaped corona.
Although we included cone-shaped coronae in the funnel regions above and below
the black hole to resemble to some degree the common assumption of a compact
lamppost corona hovering above and/or below the black hole, the fit chooses a
very large version of this corona that makes it possible to Comptonize a
sufficiently large fraction of the accretion disk photons to explain the
observed power law emission. The analysis indicates a dimensionless black hole
spin parameter a between 0.86 and 0.92. The kerrC model provides new insights
about the radial distribution of the energy flux of returning and coronal
emission irradiating the accretion disk. kerrC furthermore predicts small
polarization fractions around 1% in the 2-8 keV energy range of the recently
launched Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer.

Abstract:  Boasting supreme magnetic strengths, magnetars are among the prime candidates
to generate fast radio bursts. Several theories have been proposed for the
formation mechanism of magnetars, but have not yet been fully tested. As
different magnetar formation theories expect distinct magnetar space velocity
distributions, high-precision astrometry of Galactic magnetars can serve as a

the understanding of the distribution of Galactic magnetars. This distribution
can be compared against fast radio bursts (FRBs) localized in spiral galaxies,
in order to test the link between FRBs and magnetars. Swift J1818.0-1607 is the
hitherto fastest-spinning magnetar and the fifth discovered radio magnetar. In

overall distribution of the [CI] (1-0) emission is consistent with the CO
(1-0). While the [CI] (1-0) and CO (1-0) luminosities of the system follow the
empirical linear relation for the unresolved ULIRG sample, we find a sublinear
relation between [CI] (1-0) and CO (1-0) using the spatially-resolved data. We
measure the [CI] (1-0)/CO (1-0) luminosity ratio per pixel in star-forming
environments of Arp 220 and investigate its dependence on the CO (3-2)/CO (1-0)
ratio ($R_{\rm CO}$). On average, the [CI] (1-0)/CO (1-0) luminosity ratio is
almost constant up to $R_{\rm CO} \simeq 1$ and then increases with $R_{\rm
CO}$. According to the radiative transfer analysis, a high CI/CO abundance
ratio is required in regions with high [CI] (1-0)/CO (1-0) luminosity ratios
and $R_{\rm CO} > 1$, suggesting that the CI/CO abundance ratio varies at
$\sim$100 pc scale in Arp 220. The [CI] (1-0)/CO (1-0) luminosity ratio depends
on multiple factors and may not be straightforward to interpret. We also find
the high-velocity components traced by [CI] (1-0) in the western nucleus,
likely associated with the molecular outflow. The [CI] (1-0)/CO (1-0)
luminosity ratio in the putative outflow is 0.87 $\pm$ 0.28, which is four
times higher than the average ratio of Arp 220. While there is a possibility
that the [CI] (1-0) and CO (1-0) emission traces different components, we
suggest that the high line ratios are likely because of elevated CI/CO
abundance ratios based on our radiative transfer analysis. A CI-rich and
CO-poor gas phase in outflows could be caused by the irradiation of the cosmic
rays, the shock heating, and the intense radiation field.

Title:Small Satellite Mission Concepts for Space Weather Research and as Pathfinders for Operations,"
Abstract:  Recent advances in miniaturization and commercial availability of critical
satellite subsystems and detector technology have made small satellites
(SmallSats, including CubeSats) an attractive, low-cost potential solution for
space weather research and operational needs. Motivated by the 1st
International Workshop on SmallSats for Space Weather Research and Forecasting,
held in Washington, DC on 1-4 August 2017, we discuss the need for advanced
space weather measurement capabilities, driven by analyses from the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO), and how SmallSats can efficiently fill these
measurement gaps. We present some current, recent missions and
proposed/upcoming mission concepts using SmallSats that enhance space weather
research and provide prototyping pathways for future operational applications;
how they relate to the WMO requirements; and what challenges remain to be
overcome to meet the WMO goals and operational needs in the future. With
additional investment from cognizant funding agencies worldwide, SmallSats --
including standalone missions and constellations -- could significantly enhance
space weather research and, eventually, operations, by reducing costs and
enabling new measurements not feasible from traditional, large, monolithic
missions.

Title:Planetary Accretion Shocks with a Realistic Equation of State,"
Abstract:  The final stage of gas giant formation involves accreting gas from the parent
protoplanetary disk. In general, the infalling gas likely approaches a
free-fall velocity, creating an accretion shock, leading to strong shock
heating and radiation. We investigate the kinematics and energetics of such
accretion shocks using 1D radiation hydrodynamic simulations. Our simulations
feature the first self-consistent treatment of hydrogen dissociation and
ionization, radiation transport, and realistic grey opacity. By exploring a
broad range of giant planet masses (0.1-3 M$_{J}$) and accretion rates
($10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$M$_{\oplus}\cdot\rm{yr}^{-1}$), we focus on global shock
efficiency and the final entropy of the accreted gas. We find that radiation
from the accretion shock can fully disassociate the molecular hydrogen of the
incoming gas when the shock luminosity is above a critical luminosity.
Meanwhile, the post-shock entropy generally fall into ""cold""
($<12k_{\rm{B}}/m_{\rm H}$) and ""hot"" ($>16k_{\rm{B}}/m_{\rm H}$) groups which
depends on the extent of the endothermic process of $\rm{H}_2$ dissociation.
While 2D or 3D simulations are needed for more realistic understandings of the
accretion process, this distinction likely carries over and sheds light on the
interpretation of young direct imaging planets.

Title:Chemical Properties of the Local Disk and Halo. II. Abundances of 3745 M dwarfs and Subdwarfs from Improved Model Fitting of Low-Resolution Spectra,"
Abstract:  We present a model-fit pipeline to determine the stellar parameters of M-type
dwarfs, which is an improvement upon our previous work described in Hejazi et
al. 2020. We apply this pipeline to analyze the low-resolution (R~2000) spectra
of 3745 M dwarfs/subdwarfs, collected at the MDM Observatory, Lick Observatory,
Kitt Peak National Observatory, and Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory. We
examine the variation of the inferred parameter values in the HR diagram
constructed from their Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) parallaxes and optical
magnitudes. We also study the distribution of our stars in the abundance
diagram of [alpha/Fe] versus [M/H] and inspect the variation of their
metallicity class, effective temperature, and surface gravity as well as their
Galactic velocity components U, V, and W in this diagram. In addition, the
analyses of the stars' projected motions in the two-dimensional UV, VW, and UW
planes and the variation of their chemical parameters in these planes, and also
their distribution in the abundance-velocity diagrams are important parts of
this study. The precision of our model-fit pipeline is confirmed by the clear
stratification of effective temperature and chemical parameters in the HR
diagram, the similarity of the stars' distribution in the [alpha/Fe] versus
[M/H] diagram and in the metallicity-velocity planes with those from other
studies, revealing substructure in the abundance-velocity diagrams, and
chemical homogeneity between the components of a set of binary systems.

Title:Gas Phase Metallicities of Local Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies Follow Normal Star-Forming Galaxies,"
Abstract:  Despite advances in observational data, theoretical models, and computational
techniques to simulate key physical processes in the formation and evolution of
galaxies, the stellar mass assembly of galaxies still remains an unsolved
problem today. Optical spectroscopic measurements appear to show that the
gas-phase metallicities of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) are
significantly lower than those of normal star-forming galaxies. This difference
has resulted in the claim that ULIRGs are fueled by metal-poor gas accretion
from the outskirts\cite{Mannucci10}. Here we report on a new set of gas-phase
metallicity measurements making use of the far-infrared spectral lines of
[O{\sc iii}]52 $\mu$m, [O{\sc iii}]88 $\mu$m, and [N{\sc iii}]57 $\mu$m instead
of the usual optical lines. Photoionization models have resulted in a
metallicity diagnostic based on these three lines that break the electron
density degeneracy and reduce the scatter of the correlation significantly.
Using new data from SOFIA and archival data from Herschel Space Observatory, we
find that local ULIRGs lie on the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming
galaxies and have metallicities comparable to other galaxies with similar
stellar masses and star formation rates. The lack of a departure suggests that
ULIRGs follow the same mass assembly mechanism as luminous star-forming
galaxies and $\sim 0.3$ dex under-abundance in metallicities derived from
optical lines is a result of heavily obscured metal-rich gas which has a
negligible effect when using the FIR line diagnostics.

Title:A model for spin-orbit commensurability and synchronous starspot activity in stars with close-by planets,"
Abstract:  The rotation period of some planet-hosting stars appears to be in close
commensurability with the orbital period of their close-by planets. A model is
proposed to interpret such a phenomenon based on the excitation of resonant
oscillations in the interior magnetic field of the star by a component of the
tidal potential with a very low frequency in the reference frame rotating with
the star. A magnetic flux tube located in the overshoot layer of the star is
assumed to study the excitation of the resonant oscillations in the
magnetostrophic regime. The model considers a planet on a circular oblique
orbit and the growth timescale of the oscillations is estimated. To keep the
system in resonance with the exciting potential, in spite of the variations in
the magnetic field or tidal frequency, a self-regulating mechanism is proposed.
The model is applied to ten systems and proves capable of accounting for the
observed close commensurability in eight of them by assuming a magnetic field
between $10^{2}$ and $10^{4}$ G. Systems with low-mass distant planets, such as
AU Mic and HAT-P-11, cannot be interpreted by the proposed model. Consequences
for the spin-orbit evolution of the systems, including dynamical tides and
gyrochronology of planet-hosting stars, are discussed together with the effects
on the chromospheric features produced by star-planet magnetic interactions.

Title:Internal dark matter structure of the most massive galaxy clusters since redshift 1,"
Abstract:  We investigate the evolution of the dark matter density profiles of the most
massive galaxy clusters in the Universe. Using a `zoom-in' procedure on a large
suite of cosmological simulations of total comoving volume of $3\,(h^{-1}\,\rm
Gpc)^3$, we study the 25 most massive clusters in four redshift slices from
$z\sim 1$ to the present. The minimum mass is $M_{500} > 5.5 \times 10^{14}$
M$_{\odot}$ at $z=1$. Each system has more than two million particles within
$r_{500}$. Once scaled to the critical density at each redshift, the dark
matter profiles within $r_{500}$ are strikingly similar from $z\sim1$ to the
present day, exhibiting a low dispersion of 0.15 dex, and showing little
evolution with redshift in the radial logarithmic slope and scatter. They have
the running power law shape typical of the NFW-type profiles, and their inner
structure, resolved to $3.8\,h^{-1}$ comoving kpc at $z=1$, shows no signs of
converging to an asymptotic slope. Our results suggest that this type of
profile is already in place at $z>1$ in the highest-mass haloes in the
Universe, and that it remains exceptionally robust to merging activity.

Title:On the limitations of magneto-frictional relaxation,"
Abstract:  The magneto-frictional method is used in solar physics to compute both static
and quasi-static models of the Sun's coronal magnetic field. Here, we examine
how accurately magneto-friction (without fluid pressure) is able to predict the
relaxed state in a one-dimensional test case containing two magnetic null
points. Firstly, we show that relaxation under the full ideal
magnetohydrodynamic equations in the presence of nulls leads necessarily to a
non-force-free state, which could not be reached exactly by magneto-friction.
Secondly, the magneto-frictional solutions are shown to lead to breakdown of
magnetic flux conservation, whether or not the friction coefficient is scaled
with magnetic field strength. When this coefficient is constant, flux is
initially conserved, but only until discontinuous current sheets form at the
null points. In the ensuing weak solution, we show that magnetic flux is
dissipated at these current sheets. The breakdown of flux conservation does not
occur for an alternative viscous relaxation scheme.

Title:Cosmic ray production in superbubbles,"
Abstract:  We compute the production of cosmic rays in the dynamical superbubble
produced by a cluster of massive stars. Stellar winds, supernova remnants and
turbulence are found to accelerate particles so efficiently that the nonlinear
feedback of the particles must be taken into account in order to ensure that
the energy balance is not violated. High energy particles do not scatter
efficiently on the turbulence and escape quickly after each supernova
explosion, which makes both their intensity inside the bubble and injection in
the interstellar medium intermittent. On the other hand, the stochastic
acceleration of low energy particles hardens the spectra at GeV energies.
Because cosmic rays damp the turbulence cascade, this hardening is less
pronounced when nonlinearities are taken into account. Nevertheless, spectra
with hard components extending up to 1 to 10 GeV and normalised to an energy
density of 1 to 100 eV cm$^{-3}$ are found to be typical signatures of cosmic
rays produced in superbubbles. Efficient shock reacceleration within compact
clusters is further shown to produce hard, slightly concave spectra, while the
presence of a magnetised shell is shown to enhance the confinement of cosmic
rays in the bubble and therefore the collective plasma effects acting on them.
We eventually estimate the overall contribution of superbubbles to the galactic
cosmic ray content and show typical gamma-ray spectra expected from hadronic
interactions in superbuble shells. In both cases, a qualitative agreement with
observations is obtained.

Title:Ariel mission planning. Scheduling the survey of a thousand exoplanets,"
Abstract:  Automatic scheduling techniques are becoming a crucial tool for the efficient
planning of large astronomical surveys. A specific scheduling method is being
designed and developed for the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet
Large-survey (Ariel) mission planning based on a hybrid meta-heuristic
algorithm with global optimization capability to ensure obtaining satisfying
results fulfilling all mission constraints. We used this method to simulate the
Ariel mission plan, to assess the feasibility of its scientific goals, and to
study the outcome of different science scenarios. We conclude that Ariel will
be able to fulfill the scientific objectives, i.e. characterizing ~1000
exoplanet atmospheres, with a total exposure time representing about 75-80% of
the mission lifetime. We demonstrate that it is possible to include phase curve
observations for a sample of targets or to increase the number of studied
exoplanets within the mission lifetime. Finally, around 12-15% of the time can
still be used for non-time constrained observations.

Title:Spectral and polarization properties of reflected X-ray emission from black hole accretion discs,"
Abstract:  X-ray polarimetric missions planned for this decade will significantly
enhance our knowledge of compact accreting sources. Observations of the X-ray
polarization signal from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or X-ray binary systems
(XRBs) will bring new means to study inner accretion flow in these objects
that, together with currently used spectroscopic and timing techniques, will
help us to determine better their properties, such as their inclination,
orientation, shape, and size of their corona as well as the black hole spin. In
this work, we present a yet missing piece in the global polarization models of
black hole accretion discs. We compute the reflected X-ray emission from the
disc in a local co-moving frame using (1) the radiative transfer code TITAN to
obtain the ionization structure of the disc and (2) the Monte Carlo code STOKES
that incorporates the physics of absorption, re-emission, and Compton
scattering to produce a complete spectropolarimetric output. We present the
final Stokes parameters I, Q, and U for a set of photon-indices of the incident
primary power-law radiation, the disc ionization parameters, incident and
emission angles, for three independent polarization states of the incident
coronal X-ray photons with a sufficient resolution in energy to allow for sharp
discussion of spectral and polarization properties. We show that the spectral
component matches well literature predictions. The polarization degree and
angle are in agreement with analytical approximations previously appearing in
reflection models and we demonstrate that the polarized reflected X-ray
emission can be, locally, quite large in the 2-12 keV band.

Abstract:  Situation with highly magnetized neutron stars in binary systems is not yet

objects. On the other, there are many claims based on model-dependent analysis
of spin properties or/and luminosity of neutron stars in X-ray binaries in
favour of large fields. In addition, there are a few results suggesting a
magnetar-like activity of neutron stars in close binary systems. Most of
theoretical considerations do not favour even existence, not speaking about
active decay, of magnetar-scale fields in neutron stars older than
$\sim10^6$~yrs. However, alternative scenarios of the field evolution exist. I

presence of neutron stars with large magnetic field in binaries and discuss
perspectives of future studies.

Title:Thermal desorption of interstellar ices. A review on the controlling parameters and their implications fromsnowlines to chemical complexity,"
Abstract:  The evolution of star-forming regions and their thermal balance are strongly
influenced by their chemical composition, that, in turn, is determined by the
physico-chemical processes that govern the transition between the gas phase and
the solid state, specifically icy dust grains (e.g., particles adsorption and
desorption). Gas-grain and grain-gas transitions as well as formation and
sublimation of interstellar ices are thus essential elements of understanding
astrophysical observations of cold environments (e.g., pre-stellar cores) where
unexpected amounts of a large variety of chemical species have been observed in
the gas phase. Adsorbed atoms and molecules also undergo chemical reactions
which are not efficient in the gas phase. Therefore, the parameterization of
the physical properties of atoms and molecules interacting with dust grain
particles is clearly a key aspect to interpret astronomical observations and to
build realistic and predictive astrochemical models. In this consensus
evaluation, we focus on parameters controlling the thermal desorption of ices
and how these determine pathways towards molecular complexity and define the
location of snowlines, which ultimately influence the planet formation process.
We review different crucial aspects of desorption parameters both from a
theoretical and experimental point of view. We critically assess the desorption
parameters commonly used in the astrochemical community for astrophysical
relevant species and provide tables with recommended values. In addition, we
show that a non-trivial determination of the pre-exponential factor nu using
the Transition State Theory can affect the binding energy value. Finally, we
conclude this work by discussing the limitations of theoretical and
experimental approaches currently used to determine the desorption properties
with suggestions for future improvements.

"Title:The crucial role of surface magnetic fields for stellar dynamos: Epsilon Eridani, 61 Cygni A, and the Sun","
Abstract:  Cool main-sequence stars, such as the Sun, have magnetic fields which are
generated by an internal dynamo mechanism. In the Sun, the dynamo mechanism
produces a balance between the amounts of magnetic flux generated and lost over
the Sun's 11-year activity cycle and it is visible in the Sun's different
atmospheric layers using multi-wavelength observations. We used the same
observational diagnostics, spanning several decades, to probe the emergence of
magnetic flux on the two close by, active- and low-mass K dwarfs: 61 Cygni A
and Epsilon Eridani. Our results show that 61 Cygni A follows the Solar dynamo
with a regular cycle at all wavelengths, while Epsilon Eridani represents a
more extreme level of the Solar dynamo, while also showing strong Solar-like
characteristics. For the first time we show magnetic butterfly diagrams for
stars other than the Sun. For the two K stars and the Sun, the rate at which
the toroidal field is generated from surface poloidal field is similar to the
rate at which toroidal flux is lost through flux emergence. This suggests that
the surface field plays a crucial role in the dynamos of all three stars.
Finally, for Epsilon Eridani, we show that the two chromospheric cycle periods,
of ~3 and ~13 years, correspond to two superimposed magnetic cycles.

Title:ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions -- VII. A catalogue of SiO clumps from ACA observations,"
Abstract:  To understand the nature of SiO emission, we conducted ACA observations of
the SiO (2-1) lines toward 146 massive star-forming regions, as part of the
ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS)
survey. We detected SiO emission in 128 (87.7$\%$) sources and identified 171
SiO clumps, 105 of which are spatially separated from 3 mm continuum emission.
A large amount of the SiO line profiles (60$\%$) are non-Gaussian. The velocity
dispersion of the SiO lines ranges from 0.3 to 5.43 km s$^{-1}$. In 63 sources
the SiO clumps are associated with H$_\rm{II}$ regions characterized by
H40$\alpha$ emission. We find that 68$\%$ (116) of the SiO clumps are
associated with strong outflows. The median velocity dispersion of the SiO line
for outflow sources and non-outflow sources is 1.91 km s$^{-1}$ and 0.99 km
s$^{-1}$, respectively. These results indicate that outflow activities could be
connected to strongly shocked gas. The velocity dispersion and
[SiO]/[H$^{13}$CO$^+$] intensity ratio do not show any correlation with the
dust temperature and particle number density of clumps. We find a positive
correlation between the SiO line luminosity and the bolometric luminosity,
implying stronger shock activities are associated with more luminous
proto-clusters. The SiO clumps in associations with H$_\rm{II}$ regions were
found to show a steeper feature in $L_\rm{sio}$/$L_\rm{bol}$. The SiO line
luminosity and the fraction of shocked gas have no apparent evidence of
correlation with the evolutionary stages traced by luminosity to mass ratio
($L_\rm{bol}/M$).

Title:Persistent fast kink magnetohydrodynamic waves detected in a quiescent prominence,"
Abstract:  Small-scale, cyclic, transverse motions of plasma threads are usually seen in
solar prominences, which are often interpreted as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
waves. Here, we observed small-scale decayless transverse oscillations in a
quiescent prominence, and they appear to be omnipresent. The oscillatory
periods of the emission intensity and a proxy for the line-of-sight Doppler
shift are about half period of the displacement oscillations. This feature
agrees well with the fast kink-mode waves in a flux tube. All the moving
threads oscillate transversally spatially in phase and exhibit no significant
damping throughout the visible segments, indicating that the fast kink MHD
waves are persistently powered and ongoing dissipating energy is transferred to
the ambient plasma in the quiet corona. However, our calculations suggest that
the energy taken by the fast kink MHD waves alone can not support the coronal
heating on the quiet Sun.

Abstract:  The early and complete temporal characterization of optical, fast, transient
sources requires continuous and multi-band observations over different

telescopes to analyze single objects is the usual method, allowing the
acquisition of highly sampled light curves. Taking a series of images each
night helps to construct an uninterrupted chain of observations with a high
cadence and low duty cycle. Speed is paramount, especially at early times in
order to capture early features in the light curve that help determine the

Title:Inferring Astrophysics and Dark Matter Properties from 21cm Tomography using Deep Learning,"
Abstract:  21cm tomography opens a window to directly study astrophysics and fundamental
physics of early epochs in our Universe's history, the Epoch of Reionisation
(EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD). Summary statistics such as the power spectrum omit
information encoded in this signal due to its highly non-Gaussian nature. Here
we adopt a network-based approach for direct inference of CD and EoR
astrophysics jointly with fundamental physics from 21cm tomography. We showcase
a warm dark matter (WDM) universe, where dark matter density parameter
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and WDM mass $m_\mathrm{WDM}$ strongly influence both CD
and EoR. Reflecting the three-dimensional nature of 21cm light-cones, we
present a new, albeit simple, 3D convolutional neural network for efficient
parameter recovery at moderate training cost. On simulations we observe
high-fidelity parameter recovery for CD and EoR astrophysics ($R^2>0.78-0.99$),
together with DM density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ ($R^2>0.97$) and WDM mass
($R^2>0.61$, significantly better for $m_\mathrm{WDM}<3-4\,$keV). For realistic
mock observed light-cones that include noise and foreground levels expected for
the Square Kilometre Array, we note that in an optimistic foreground scenario
parameter recovery is unaffected, while for moderate, less optimistic
foreground levels (occupying the so-called wedge) the recovery of the WDM mass
deteriorates, while other parameters remain robust against increased foreground
levels at $R^2>0.9$. We further test the robustness of our network-based
inference against modelling uncertainties and systematics by transfer learning
between bare simulations and mock observations; we find robust recovery of
specific X-ray luminosity and ionising efficiency, while DM density and WDM
mass come with increased bias and scatter.

Title:X-ray Line Diagnostics of Ion Temperature at Cosmic-Ray Accelerating Collisionless Shocks,"
Abstract:  A novel collisionless shock jump condition is suggested by modeling the
entropy production at the shock transition region. We also calculate downstream
developments of the atomic ionization balance and the ion temperature
relaxation in supernova remnants (SNRs). The injection process and subsequent
acceleration of cosmic-rays (CRs) in the SNR shocks are closely related to the
formation process of the collisionless shocks. The formation of the shock is
caused by wave-particle interactions. Since the wave-particle interactions
result in energy exchanges between electromagnetic fields and charged
particles, the randomization of particles associated with the shock transition
may occur with the rate given by the scalar product of the electric field and
current. We find that order-of-magnitude estimates of the randomization with
reasonable strength of the electromagnetic fields in the SNR constrain the
amount of the CR nuclei and ion temperatures. The constrained amount of the CR
nuclei can be sufficient to explain the Galactic CRs. The ion temperature
becomes significantly lower than in the case of no CRs. To distinguish the case
without CRs, we perform synthetic observations of atomic line emissions from
the downstream region of the SNR RCW~86. Future observations by {\it XRISM} and
{\it Athena} can distinguish whether the SNR shock accelerates the CRs or not
from the ion temperatures.

Title:Polarization of Rotationally Oblate Self-Luminous Exoplanets with Anisotropic Atmospheres,"
Abstract:  Young self-luminous giant exoplanets are expected to be oblate in shape owing
to the high rotational speeds observed for some objects. Similar to the case of
brown dwarfs, the thermal emission from these planets should be polarized by
scatterings of molecules and condensate cloud particles, and the
rotation-induced asymmetry of the planet's disk would yield to net non-zero
detectable polarization. Considering an anisotropic atmosphere, we present here
a three-dimensional approach to estimate the disk-averaged polarization that
arises due to the oblateness of the planets. We solve the multiple-scattering
vector radiative transfer equations at each location on the planet's disk and
calculate the local Stokes vectors and then calculate the disk-integrated flux
and linear polarization. For a cloud-free atmosphere, the polarization signal
is observable only in the visible wavelength region. However, the presence of
clouds in the planetary atmospheres leads to a detectable amount of
polarization in the infrared wavelength region where the planetary thermal
emission peaks. Considering different broad-band filters of the SPHERE-IRDIS
instrument of the Very Large Telescope, we present generic models for the
polarization at different wavelength bands as a function of their rotation
period. We also present polarization models for the Exoplanets $\beta$ Pic b
and ROXs 42B b as two representative cases which can guide future observations.
Our insights on the polarization of young giant planets presented here would be
useful for the upcoming polarimetric observations of the directly imaged

and standard (2-10 keV) X-ray ranges, both in terms of sensitivity and angular
resolution. We have analysed the possibility of detecting various types of
isolated neutron stars with eROSITA. Among already known objects, eROSITA will
be able to detect more than 160 pulsars, 21 magnetars, 7 central compact
objects, all seven sources of the Magnificent Seven, and two other X-ray
isolated neutron stars during the four-year survey mission.

Title:Measurement and simulation of charge diffusion in a small-pixel charge-coupled device,"
Abstract:  Future high-resolution imaging X-ray observatories may require detectors with
both fine spatial resolution and high quantum efficiency at relatively high
X-ray energies (>5keV). A silicon imaging detector meeting these requirements
will have a ratio of detector thickness to pixel size of six or more, roughly
twice that of legacy imaging sensors. This implies greater diffusion of X-ray
charge packets. We investigate consequences for sensor performance, reporting
charge diffusion measurements in a fully-depleted, 50um thick, back-illuminated
CCD with 8um pixels. We are able to measure the size distributions of charge
packets produced by 5.9 keV and 1.25 keV X-rays in this device. We find that
individual charge packets exhibit a gaussian spatial distribution, and
determine the frequency distribution of event widths for a range of internal
electric field strength levels. We find a standard deviation for the largest
charge packets, which occur near the entrance window, of 3.9um. We show that
the shape of the event width distribution provides a clear indicator of full
depletion and infer the relationship between event width and interaction depth.
We compare measured width distributions to simulations. We compare traditional,
'sum-above-threshold' algorithms for event amplitude determination to 2D
gaussian fitting of events and find better spectroscopic performance with the
former for 5.9 keV events and comparable results at 1.25 keV. The reasons for
this difference are discussed. We point out the importance of read noise driven
detection thresholds in spectral resolution, and note that the derived read
noise requirements for mission concepts such as AXIS and Lynx may be too lax to
meet spectral resolution requirements. While we report measurements made with a
CCD, we note that they have implications for the performance of high
aspect-ratio silicon active pixel sensors as well.

Title:Cosmic Birefringence from Planck Data Release 4,"
Abstract:  We search for the signature of parity-violating physics in the cosmic
microwave background, called cosmic birefringence, using the Planck data
release 4. We initially find a birefringence angle of $\beta=0.30\pm0.11$ (68%
C.L.) for nearly full-sky data. The values of $\beta$ decrease as we enlarge
the Galactic mask, which can be interpreted as the effect of polarized
foreground emission. Two independent ways to model this effect are used to
mitigate the systematic impact on $\beta$ for different sky fractions. We
choose not to assign cosmological significance to the measured value of $\beta$
until we improve our knowledge of the foreground polarization.

Title:Rapidly Descending Dark Energy and the End of Cosmic Expansion,"
Abstract:  If dark energy is a form of quintessence driven by a scalar field $\phi$
evolving down a monotonically decreasing potential $V(\phi)$ that passes
sufficiently below zero, the universe is destined to undergo a series of smooth
transitions. The currently observed accelerated expansion will cease; soon
thereafter, expansion will come to end altogether; and the universe will pass
into a phase of slow contraction. In this paper, we consider how short the
remaining period of expansion can be given current observational constraints on
dark energy. We also discuss how this scenario fits naturally with cyclic
cosmologies and recent conjectures about quantum gravity.

Title:A Census of the Low Accretors. I: The Catalog,"
Abstract:  Observations have shown that the disk frequency and the fraction of accreting
pre-main-sequence stars decrease with the age of the population and that some
stars appear to have disks while their accretion has stopped. Still, it is
unclear how disk-bearing stars stop their accretion. To provide insight into
the last stages of accretion in low-mass young stars, we conducted a survey of
disk-bearing stars that are thought to be non-accretors to identify stars still
accreting at very low rates. Here we present the first catalog of the survey of
170 disk-bearing non-accreting stars in Chamaeleon I, Orion OB1, Upper
Scorpius, $\gamma$ Velorum, and Upper Centaurus Lupus, using He I
$\lambda$10830 as a sensitive probe of accretion. We classify the line profiles
into six types and argue that those showing redshifted and/or blueshifted
absorption are still accreting. Using these classifications, we found that,
among disk-bearing stars previously classified as non-accretors, at least
20-30% are still accreting, with a larger fraction of those at younger
population ages. While the difference between the outer disk signature and
accretion status is unclear, we find a difference between the inner disk excess
and accretion status. There is no preference in the mass of the newly
identified accretors, suggesting that the processes inhibiting accretion do not
directly depend on mass in the typical mass range of T Tauri stars. Lastly, we
found that at a low accretion level, the H$\alpha$ width at the 10% height
criteria mischaracterizes a larger fraction of accretors than the line's
equivalent width.

"Title:Investigating the architecture and internal structure of the TOI-561 system planets with CHEOPS, HARPS-N and TESS","
Abstract:  We present a precise characterization of the TOI-561 planetary system
obtained by combining previously published data with TESS and CHEOPS
photometry, and a new set of $62$ HARPS-N radial velocities (RVs). Our joint
analysis confirms the presence of four transiting planets, namely TOI-561 b ($P
= 0.45$ d, $R = 1.42$ R$_\oplus$, $M = 2.0$ M$_\oplus$), c ($P = 10.78$ d, $R =
2.91$ R$_\oplus$, $M = 5.4$ M$_\oplus$), d ($P = 25.7$ d, $R = 2.82$
R$_\oplus$, $M = 13.2$ M$_\oplus$) and e ($P = 77$ d, $R = 2.55$ R$_\oplus$, $M
= 12.6$ M$_\oplus$). Moreover, we identify an additional, long-period signal
($>450$ d) in the RVs, which could be due to either an external planetary
companion or to stellar magnetic activity. The precise masses and radii
obtained for the four planets allowed us to conduct interior structure and
atmospheric escape modelling. TOI-561 b is confirmed to be the lowest density
($\rho_{\rm b} = 3.8 \pm 0.5$ g cm$^{-3}$) ultra-short period (USP) planet
known to date, and the low metallicity of the host star makes it consistent
with the general bulk density-stellar metallicity trend. According to our
interior structure modelling, planet b has basically no gas envelope, and it
could host a certain amount of water. In contrast, TOI-561 c, d, and e likely
retained an H/He envelope, in addition to a possibly large water layer. The
inferred planetary compositions suggest different atmospheric evolutionary
paths, with planets b and c having experienced significant gas loss, and
planets d and e showing an atmospheric content consistent with the original
one. The uniqueness of the USP planet, the presence of the long-period planet
TOI-561 e, and the complex architecture make this system an appealing target
for follow-up studies.

Title:A common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) impostor scenario for fast blue optical transients,"
Abstract:  I propose a new scenario, the polar common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN)
impostor scenario, to account for AT2018cow-like fast blue optical transients
(FBOTs). The polar CEJSN impostor scenario evolves through four main phases.
(1) A red supergiant (RSG) star expands to tidally interact with a neutron star
(NS) companion (or a black hole). The interaction increases the RSG mass loss
rate to form a circumstellar matter (CSM) halo to ~0.1pc. (2) Shortly before
the onset of a common envelope evolution (CEE) and about a year before
explosion the NS accretes mass from the RSG envelope and launches jets that
inflate two opposite lobes in the CSM within ~100AU. (3) The NS-RSG system
enters a CEE phase during which the system ejects most of the envelope mass in
a dense equatorial outflow. (4) At the termination of the CEE the leftover
envelope forms a circumbinary disk around the NS-core system. The NS accretes
mass from the circumbinary disk and launches energetic jets that when collide
with the fronts of the CSM lobes power an FBOT event. The low mass of the
jets-lobes interaction zones and their large distance, of about 100AU, from the
center account for the fast transient. In the future the core collapses to form
a second NS. In the far future the two NS might merge. I suggest that FBOTs and
similar fast transients are CEJSN impostors which compose a large fraction of
the progenitors of NS-NS merger binaries.

Title:The family of V1311 Ori: a young sextuple system or a mini-cluster?,"
Abstract:  A compact bound group of four active M-type dwarfs containing V1311 Ori is
identified in the Gaia catalog of nearby stars. Located at a distance of 39 pc,
it is likely related to the beta Pictoris and 32 Ori moving groups by
kinematics, isochronal age, and other indicators of youth (Halpha emission,
presence of lithium, and fast rotation). The brightest star A is a known close
binary, for which a preliminary 80-yr visual-spectroscopic orbit is determined.
Star B is resolved here into a 0.08"" pair, and the faintest stars C and D are
probably single. Considering the non-hierarchical configuration with projected
separations of ~10 kau, this could be either a young sextuple system or a bound
but dynamically unstable mini-cluster (trapezium) that avoided disruption so
far. This pre-main-sequence system bridges the gap between moving groups and
wide hierarchies.

Title:The origin of the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 2206+54/BD +53 2790,"
Abstract:  Based on the Gaia EDR3 astrometric parameters and our new systemic radial
velocity of the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 2206+54/BD+53 2790, we studied the
trace back motion of the system and propose that it originated in the subgroup
of the Cepheus OB1 association (Age~4-10 Myr) with its brightest star BD+53
2820 (B0V; L~$10^{4.7}$L$_\odot$). The kinematic age of 4U 2206+54 is about
2.8$\pm$0.4 Myr, it is at a distance of 3.1-3.3 kpc and has a space velocity of
75-100 km/s with respect to this member star (BD+53 2820) of the Cep OB1
association. This runaway velocity indicates that the progenitor of the neutron
star hosted by 4U 2206+54 lost about 4-9 $M_{\odot}$ during the supernova
explosion and the latter one received a kick velocity of at least 200-350 km/s.
Since the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 2206+54/BD+53 2790 was born as a member of
a subgroup of Cep OB1, the initially most massive star in the system terminated
its evolution within ~7-9 Myr, corresponding to an initial mass >=
32$M_{\odot}$.

Title:A Full $w$CDM Analysis of KiDS-1000 Weak Lensing Maps using Deep Learning,"
Abstract:  We present a full forward-modeled $w$CDM analysis of the KiDS-1000 weak
lensing maps using graph-convolutional neural networks (GCNN). Utilizing the
$\texttt{CosmoGrid}$, a novel massive simulation suite spanning six different
cosmological parameters, we generate almost one million tomographic mock
surveys on the sphere. Due to the large data set size and survey area, we
perform a spherical analysis while limiting our map resolution to
$\texttt{HEALPix}$ $n_\mathrm{side}=512$. We marginalize over systematics such
as photometric redshift errors, multiplicative calibration and additive shear
bias. Furthermore, we use a map-level implementation of the non-linear
intrinsic alignment model along with a novel treatment of baryonic feedback to
incorporate additional astrophysical nuisance parameters. We also perform a
spherical power spectrum analysis for comparison. The constraints of the
cosmological parameters are generated using a likelihood free inference method
called Gaussian Process Approximate Bayesian Computation (GPABC). Finally, we
check that our pipeline is robust against choices of the simulation parameters.
We find constraints on the degeneracy parameter of $S_8 \equiv
\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_M/0.3} = 0.78^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ for our power spectrum
analysis and $S_8 = 0.79^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ for our GCNN analysis, improving the
former by 16%. This is consistent with earlier analyses of the 2-point
function, albeit slightly higher. Baryonic corrections generally broaden the
constraints on the degeneracy parameter by about 10%. These results offer great
prospects for full machine learning based analyses of on-going and future weak
lensing surveys.

Title:Extragalactic fast X-ray transient candidates discovered by Chandra (2000-2014),"
Abstract:  Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transients (FXRTs) are short flashes of X-ray
photons spanning a few seconds to hours, with an uncertain origin. Our
ignorance about their physical mechanisms and progenitor systems is due in part
to the lack of clear multi-wavelength counterparts in most cases because they
only have been identified serendipitously. We develop a systematic search of
FXRTs using a straightforward X-ray flare search algorithm, in the Chandra
Source Catalog (Data Release 2.0; 169.6 Ms over 592.4 deg$^{2}$ using only
observations with $|b|>10^{\circ}$ and before 2015), incorporating various
multi-wavelength constraints to rule out Galactic contamination and
characterize the candidates. We report the detection of 14 FXRT candidates from
a parent sample of 214,701 sources. Candidates have peak 0.5-7 keV fluxes
between 1$\times$10$^{-13}$ to 2$\times$10$^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and
$T_{90}$ values from 4 to 48 ks. The sample can be subdivided into two groups:
six ""nearby"" FXRTs that occurred within $d\lesssim$100 Mpc and eight ""distant""
FXRTs with likely redshifts $\gtrsim$0.1. Three distant FXRT candidates exhibit
light curves with a plateau (${\approx}$1-3 ks duration) followed by a
power-law decay and X-ray spectral softening, similar to what was observed for
the previously reported FXRT CDF-S~XT2, a proposed magnetar-powered binary
neutron star merger event. After applying completeness corrections, we
calculate event rates for the nearby and distant samples of
53.7$_{-15.1}^{+22.6}$ and 28.2$_{-6.9}^{+9.8}$ deg$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$,
respectively. This novel sample of Chandra-detected extragalactic FXRT
candidates, although modest in size, breaks new ground in terms of
characterizing the diverse properties, nature, and possible progenitors of
these enigmatic events.

Title:Test Problems for Potential Field Source Surface Extrapolations of Solar and Stellar Magnetic Fields,"
Abstract:  The potential field source surface (PFSS) equations are commonly used to
model the coronal magnetic field of the Sun and other stars. As with any
computational model, solving equations using a numerical scheme introduces
errors due to discretisation. We present a set of tests for quantifying these
errors by taking advantage of analytic solutions to the PFSS equations when the
input field is proportional to a single spherical harmonic. From the spherical
harmonic solutions we derive analytic equations for magnetic field lines traced
through the three dimensional magnetic field solution. We propose these as a
set of standard analytic solutions that all PFSS solvers should be tested
against to quantify their inherent errors. We apply these tests to the pfsspy
software package, showing that it reproduces spherical harmonic solutions well
with a slight overestimation of the unsigned open magnetic flux. It is also
successful at reproducing analytic field line equations, with errors in field
line footpoints typically much less than one degree.

Title:Balancing Turbulent Heating with Radiative Cooling in Blazars,"
Abstract:  Recently, particle in cell (PIC) simulations have shown that relativistic
turbulence in collisionless plasmas can result in an equilibrium particle
distribution function where turbulent heating is balanced by radiative cooling
of electrons. Strongly magnetized plasmas are characterized by higher energy
peaks and broader particle distributions. In relativistically moving
astrophysical jets, it is believed that the flow is launched Poynting flux
dominated and that the resulting magnetic instabilities may create a turbulent
environment inside the jet, i.e., the regime of relativistic turbulence. In
this paper, we extend previous PIC simulation results to larger values of
plasma magnetization by linearly extrapolating the diffusion and advection
coefficients relevant for the turbulent plasmas under consideration. We use
these results to build a single zone turbulent jet model that is based on the
global parameters of blazar emission region, and consistently calculate the
particle distribution and resulting synchrotron and inverse Compton emission
spectra. We then test our model by comparing its predictions with the
broad-band quiescent emission spectra of a dozen blazars. Our results show good
agreement with observations of low-synchrotron peaked (LSP) sources and find
that LSPs are moderately Poynting flux dominated with magnetization $1\lesssim
\sigma \lesssim 5$, have bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma\sim 10-30$, and that the
turbulent region is located at the edge, or just beyond, the broad line region
(BLR). The turbulence is found to be driven at an area comparable to the jet
cross section.

Title:Cosmological Results from the RAISIN Survey: Using Type Ia Supernovae in the Near Infrared as a Novel Path to Measure the Dark Energy Equation of State,"
Abstract:  Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are more precise standardizable candles when
measured in the near-infrared (NIR) than in the optical. With this motivation,
from 2012-2017 we embarked on the RAISIN program with the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) to obtain rest-frame NIR light curves for a cosmologically
distant sample of 37 SN Ia ($0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.6$) discovered by
Pan-STARRS and the Dark Energy Survey. By comparing higher-$z$ HST data with 42
SN Ia at $z<0.1$ observed in the NIR by the Carnegie Supernova Project, we
construct a Hubble diagram from NIR observations (with only time of maximum
light and some selection cuts from optical data) to pursue a unique avenue to
constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter, $w$. We analyze the
dependence of the full set of Hubble residuals on the SN Ia host galaxy mass
and find Hubble residual steps of size $\sim$0.06-0.1~mag with 1.5- to
2.5-$\sigma$ significance depending on the method and step location. Combining
our NIR sample with CMB constraints, we find $1+w=-0.17\pm0.12$ (stat$+$syst).
The largest systematic errors are the redshift-dependent SN selection biases
and the properties of the NIR mass step. We also use these data to measure
$H_0=75.9\pm 2.2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ from stars with geometric distance
calibration in the hosts of 8 SNe Ia observed in the NIR versus
$H_0=71.2\pm3.8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ using an inverse distance ladder
approach tied to Planck. Using optical data we find $1+w=-0.10\pm0.09$ and with
optical and NIR data combined, we find $1+w=-0.06\pm0.07$; these shifts of up
to 0.11 in $w$ could point to inconsistency in optical versus NIR SN models.
There will be many opportunities to improve this NIR measurement and better
understand systematic uncertainties through larger low-$z$ samples, new
light-curve models, calibration improvements, and by building high-$z$ samples
from the Roman Space Telescope.

Title:Host Dark Matter Halos of SDSS Red and Blue Quasars: No Significant Difference in Large-scale Environment,"
Abstract:  The observed optical colors of quasars are generally interpreted in one of
two frameworks: unified models which attribute color to random orientation of
the accretion disk along the line-of-sight, and evolutionary models which
invoke connections between quasar systems and their environments. We test these
schema by probing the dark matter halo environments of optically-selected
quasars as a function of $g-i$ optical color by measuring the two-point
correlation functions of $\sim$ 0.34 million eBOSS quasars as well as the
gravitational deflection of cosmic microwave background photons around $\sim$
0.66 million XDQSO photometric quasar candidates. We do not detect a trend of
halo bias with optical color through either analysis, finding that
optically-selected quasars at $0.8 < z < 2.2$ occupy halos of characteristic
mass $M_{h}\sim 3\times 10^{12} \ h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ regardless of their color.
This result implies that a quasar's large-scale halo environment is not
strongly connected to its observed optical color. We also confirm findings of
fundamental differences in the radio properties of red and blue quasars by
stacking 1.4 GHz FIRST images at their positions, suggesting the observed
differences cannot be attributed to orientation. Instead, the differences
between red and blue quasars likely arise on nuclear-galactic scales, perhaps
owing to reddening by a nuclear dusty wind. Finally, we show that
optically-selected quasars' halo environments are also independent of their
$r-W2$ optical-infrared colors, while previous work has suggested that
mid-infrared-selected obscured quasars occupy more massive halos. We discuss
implications of this result for models of quasar and galaxy co-evolution.

Title:A GALAH View of the Chemical Homogeneity and Ages of Stellar Strings Identified in Gaia,"
Abstract:  The advent of Gaia has led to the discovery of nearly 300 elongated stellar
associations (called `strings') spanning hundreds of parsecs in length and mere
tens of parsecs in width. These newfound populations present an excellent
laboratory for studying the assembly process of the Milky Way thin disk. In
this work, we use data from GALAH DR3 to investigate the chemical distributions
and ages of 18 newfound stellar populations, 10 of which are strings and 8 of
which are compact in morphology. We estimate the intrinsic abundance
dispersions in [X/H] of each population and compare them with those of both
their local fields and the open cluster M 67. We find that all but one of these
groups are more chemically homogeneous than their local fields. Furthermore,
half of the strings, namely Theias 139, 169, 216, 303, and 309, have intrinsic
[X/H] dispersions that range between 0.01 and 0.07 dex in most elements,
equivalent to those of many open clusters. These results provide important new
observational constraints on star formation and the chemical homogeneity of the
local interstellar medium (ISM). We investigate each population's Li and
chemical clock abundances (e.g., [Sc/Ba], [Ca/Ba], [Ti/Ba], and [Mg/Y]) and
find that the ages suggested by chemistry generally support the isochronal ages
in all but six structures. This work highlights the unique advantages that
chemistry holds in the study of kinematically-related stellar groups.

Title:The half mass radius of MaNGA galaxies. I. Effect of IMF gradients,"
Abstract:  Gradients in the stellar populations of galaxies -- e.g., in age,
metallicity, IMF -- can result in gradients in the stellar mass to light ratio,
$M_*/L$. Such gradients imply that the distribution of the stellar mass and
light are different. For old stellar populations, such as those typical of
early-type galaxies at $z\sim 0$, the $M_*/L$ gradients are weak if driven by
variations in age and metallicity. However, if they are driven by variations in
the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF), then they can be significantly larger.
An IMF-driven gradient which has $M_*/L$ decreasing outwards from the center
increases the estimated total stellar mass ($M_*$) and reduces the scale which
contains half this mass ($R_{e,*}$), compared to the values of mass and size
when the gradient is ignored. We estimate IMF-gradients from spatially resolved
spectra of early-type galaxies in the final release of the MaNGA survey,
showing that the fractional decrease in $R_{e,*}$ can be significantly larger
than the fractional $M_*$ increase, especially when the light is more centrally
concentrated. The $R_{e,*}-M_*$ correlation which results from the IMF-driven
$M_*/L$ gradients at $z\sim 0$ is offset by almost 0.3 dex to smaller sizes
compared to when these gradients are ignored. Comparison with higher redshift
samples is not straightforward. If it is fair to compare $z\sim 0$ `early-type'
galaxies with `quiescent' galaxies at higher-$z$, then one must be able to
consistently account for evolution in stellar population gradients (especially
age and IMF) as well as changes in the steepness of the light profile before
drawing conclusions about the evolution of the $R_{e,*}-M_*$ relation.

Title:Cool circumgalactic gas in galaxy clusters: connecting the DESI legacy imaging survey and SDSS DR16 MgII absorbers,"
Abstract:  We investigate the cool gas absorption in galaxy clusters by
cross-correlating MgII absorbers detected in quasar spectra from Data Release
16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with galaxy clusters identified in
the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. We find significant
covering fractions ($1-5\, \%$ within $r_{500}$, depending on the chosen
redshift interval), $\sim 4-5$ times higher than around random sightlines.
While the covering fraction of cool gas in clusters decreases with increasing
mass of the central galaxy, the total MgII mass within $r_{\rm 500}$ is
nonetheless $\sim 10$ times higher than for SDSS luminous red galaxies (LRGs).
The MgII covering fraction versus impact parameter is well described by a power
law in the inner regions and a exponential function at larger distances. The
characteristic scale of the transition between these two regimes is smaller for
large equivalent width absorbers. Cross-correlating MgII absorption with
photo-z selected cluster member galaxies from DESI reveals a statistically
significant connection. The median projected distance between MgII absorbers
and the nearest cluster member is $\sim200$ kpc, compared to $\sim500$ kpc in
random mocks with the same galaxy density profiles. We do not find a
correlation between MgII strength and the star formation rate of the closest
cluster neighbour. This suggests that cool gas in clusters, as traced by MgII
absorption, is: (i) associated with satellite galaxies, (ii) dominated by cold
gas clouds in the intracluster medium, rather than by the interstellar medium
of galaxies, and (iii) may originate in part from gas stripped from these
cluster satellites in the past.

redshifts studied in this work, we find bulge mass to be the most predictive
parameter of quenching, out of the photometric parameter set (incorporating
bulge mass, disk mass, total stellar mass, and $B/T$ structure). Moreover, we
also find bulge mass to be the most predictive parameter of quenching in both
bulge and disk structures, treated separately. Hence, intrinsic galaxy
quenching must be due to a stable mechanism operating over cosmic time, and the
same quenching mechanism must be effective in both bulge and disk regions.
Despite the success of bulge mass in predicting quenching, we find that central
velocity dispersion is even more predictive (when available in spectroscopic
data sets). In comparison to the LGalaxies model, we find that all of these
observational results may be consistently explained through quenching via
preventative `radio-mode' active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. Furthermore,
many alternative quenching mechanisms (including virial shocks, supernova
feedback, and morphological stabilisation) are found to be inconsistent with
our observational results and those from the literature.

Title:The Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey (BEARS) I: redshifts of bright gravitationally-lensed galaxies from the Herschel ATLAS,"
Abstract:  We present spectroscopic measurements for 71 galaxies associated with 62 of
the brightest high-redshift submillimeter sources from the Southern fields of
the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS), while
targeting 85 sources which resolved into 142. We have obtained robust redshift
measurements for all sources using the 12-m Array and an efficient tuning of
ALMA to optimise its use as a redshift hunter, with 73 per cent of the sources
having a robust redshift identification. Nine of these redshift identifications
also rely on observations from the Atacama Compact Array. The spectroscopic
redshifts span a range $1.41<z<4.53$ with a mean value of 2.75, and the CO
emission line full-width at half-maxima range between $\rm 110\,km\,s^{-1} <
FWHM < 1290\,km\,s^{-1}$ with a mean value of $\sim$ 500kms$^{-1}$, in line
with other high-$z$ samples. The derived CO(1-0) luminosity is significantly
elevated relative to line-width to CO(1-0) luminosity scaling relation, which
is suggestive of lensing magnification across our sources. In fact, the
distribution of magnification factors inferred from the CO equivalent widths is
consistent with expectations from galaxy-galaxy lensing models, though there is
a hint of an excess at large magnifications that may be attributable to the
additional lensing optical depth from galaxy groups or clusters.

"Title:A Survey of Disc Thickness and Viscosity in Circumbinary Accretion: Binary Evolution, Variability, and Disc Morphology","
Abstract:  Much of the parameter space relevant to the evolution of astrophysical
circumbinary accretion discs remains unexplored. We have carried out a suite of
circumbinary disc simulations surveying both disc thickness and kinematic
viscosity, using both constant-$\nu$ and constant-$\alpha$ prescriptions. We
focus primarily on disc aspect ratios between $0.1$ and $0.033$, and on
viscosities between $\nu=0.0005$ and $\nu=0.008$ (in units of binary semi-major
axis and orbital frequency), and specialise to circular equal-mass binaries.
Both factors strongly influence the evolution of the binary semi-major axis: at
$\nu=0.0005,$ inspirals occur at aspect ratios $\lesssim0.059$, while at
$\nu=0.004$ inspirals occur only at aspect ratios $\lesssim0.04$. Inspirals
occur largely because of the increasingly strong negative torque on the binary
by streams of material which lag the binary, with negligible contributions from
resonant torques excited in the circumbinary disc. We find that reductions in
accretion rate occur when simulations are initialised too far from the eventual
quasi-steady state driven by interaction with the binary, rather than being
intrinsically linked to the disc aspect ratio. We find not only that the cavity
size increases as viscosity is decreased, but that thinner circumbinary discs
become more eccentric. Our results suggest that supermassive black hole
binaries should be driven, more rapidly than previous estimates, from
$\sim$parsec separations to distances where gravitational waves drive their
inspiral, potentially reducing the number of binaries observable by pulsar
timing arrays.

"Title:Scatter in the satellite galaxy SHMR: fitting functions, scaling relations & physical processes from the IllustrisTNG simulation","
Abstract:  The connection between galaxies and their dark matter haloes is often
described with the Stellar-to-Halo Mass relation (SHMR). Satellite galaxies in
clusters have been shown to follow a SHMR distinct from central galaxies
because of the environmental processes that they are subject to. In addition,
the variety of accretion histories leads to an important scatter in this
relation, even more for satellites than for central galaxies. In this work, we
use the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to study the scatter in the
satellite galaxy SHMR, and extract the parameters that can best allow to
understand it. Active galaxies, that represent a very small fraction of cluster
galaxies, follow a very different relation than their passive counterparts,
mainly because they were accreted much more recently. For this latter
population, we find that the distance to the cluster centre is a good predictor
of variations in the SHMR, but some information on the galaxy orbital history,
such as the distance of closest approach to the host centre, is an even better
one, although it is in practice more difficult to measure. In addition, we
found that galaxy compactness is also correlated with the SHMR, while the host
cluster properties (mass and concentration, formation redshift, mass and size
of BCG) do not play a significant role. We provide accurate fitting functions
and scaling relations to the scientific community, useful to predict the
subhalo mass given a set of observable parameters. Finally, we connect the
scatter in the SHMR to the physical processes affecting galaxies in clusters,
and how they impact the different satellite sub-populations.

Title:Episodic Gaseous Outflows and Mass Loss from Red Supergiants,"
Abstract:  The red hypergiant VY CMa and the more typical red supergiant Betelgeuse
provide clear observational evidence for discrete, directed gaseous outflows in
their optical and infrared imaging, spectra, and light curves. In the very
luminous VY CMa, mass loss estimates from the infrared bright knots and clumps,
not only dominate its measured overall mass loss, but explain it. In the lower
luminosity Betelgeuse, similar mass estimates of its circumstellar
condensations show that they contribute significantly to its measured mass loss
rate. We present new measurements for both stars and discuss additional
evidence for gaseous ejections in other red supergiants. Gaseous outflows are
the dominant mass loss mechanism for the most luminous RSGs and an important
contributor to the more typical red supergiants like Betelgeuse. We conclude
that gaseous outflows, related to magnetic fields and surface activity,
comparable to coronal mass ejections, are a major contributor to mass loss from
red supergiants and the missing component in discussions of their mass loss
mechanism.

Title:Submillimeter pulsations from the magnetar XTE J1810-197,"
Abstract:  We present the first detection of pulsations from a neutron star in the
submillimeter range. The source is the magnetar XTE J1810-197, observed with
the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) on 2020 February 27, 2020 July 9 and
2021 May 15. XTE J1810-197 is detected at 353 GHz ($\lambda=0.85\,$mm) in the
three epochs, but not detected in the simultaneously-observed band at 666 GHz
($\lambda=0.45\,$mm). We measure an averaged flux density at 353 GHz of
6.7$\pm$1.0, 4.0$\pm$0.6, and 1.3$\pm$0.3 mJy and set 3$\sigma$ flux density
upper limits at 666 GHz of 11.3, 4.7 and 4.3 mJy, at each of the three
observing epochs, respectively. Combining close-in-time observations with the
Effelsberg 100m and IRAM 30m telescopes covering non-contiguously from 6 to 225
GHz (5.0 cm$>\lambda>$1.33 mm), we investigate the spectral shape and frequency
range of a potential spectral turn-up predicted by some pulsar radio emission
models. The results demonstrate that the beamed radio emission from neutron
stars can extend into the submillimeter regime, but are inconclusive on the
existence and location of a potential spectral turn-up within the covered
frequency range. The observed properties of the submillimeter emission resemble
those of the longer wavelengths, and support a coherent mechanism for the
production of pulsations at 353 GHz.

Title:First Solar Radio Burst Observations by the Mexican Array Radio Telescope (MEXART) at 140 MHz,"
Abstract:  The National Laboratory of Space Weather in Mexico (Laboratorio Nacional de
ClimaEspacial: LANCE) coordinates instrumentation for monitoring the
space-weatherimpact over Mexico. Two of these instruments are the Mexican Array
Radio Telescope(MEXART) and Compound Astronomical Low frequency Low cost
Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory(CALLISTO) station
from the e-CALLISTO network (CALLMEX). Both instruments are located at the same
facility(Coeneo Michoacan, Mexico) and share a spectral band centered at 140
MHz. In this work we show the capabilities of the e-CALLISTO network as support
to identify a solar radio burst in the signal of the MEXART radiotelescope. We
identify 75 solarradio bursts in the MEXART signal: five events of Type II and
70 of Type III between September 2015 and May 2019. The analysis of solar radio
bursts in the MEXART signal provide us valuable information about the
development of the radio event due their high sensitivity, time resolution, and
isotropic response. For the case of Type III solar radio events, we identify
three characteristic phases in the dynamical evolution ofthe signal at 140 MHz:
a pre-phase, a main peak, a decay phase, and a post-event phase.A Morlet wave
transform was done of MEXART signals in the Type III solar radiobusts; in their
spectra it was identified a pine tree structure preceding the main event in the

Title:Gas condensation in Brightest Group Galaxies unveiled with MUSE,"
Abstract:  The origin of the cold gas in central galaxies in groups is still a matter of
debate. We present Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of 18
optically selected local Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) to study the
kinematics and distribution of the optical emission-line gas. MUSE observations
reveal a distribution of gas morphologies including ten complex networks of
filaments extending up to 10 kpc to two compact (<3 kpc) and five extended (>5
kpc) disk-dominated structures. Some rotating disks show rings and elongated
structures arising from the central disk. The kinematics of the stellar
component is mainly rotation-dominated, which is very different from the
disturbed kinematics and distribution found in the filamentary sources. The
ionized gas is kinematically decoupled from the stellar component for most
systems, suggesting an external origin for the gas. We also find that the
Halpha luminosity correlates with the cold molecular mass. By exploring the
thermodynamical properties of the hot atmospheres, we find that the filamentary
sources and compact disks are found in systems with small central entropy
values and tcool/teddy ratios. This suggests that, like for Brightest Cluster
Galaxies in cool core clusters, the ionized gas are likely formed from hot halo
gas condensations, consistently with the Chaotic Cold Accretion simulations (as
shown via the C-ratio, Tat, and k-plot). We note that gaseous rotating disks
are more frequent than in BCGs. An explanation for the origin of the gas in
those objects is a contribution to gas fueling by mergers or group satellites,
as qualitatively hinted by some sources of the present sample. Nonetheless, we
discuss the possibility that some extended disks could also be a transition
stage in an evolutionary sequence including filaments, extended disks and
compact disks, as described by hot gas condensation models of cooling flows.

Title:On the Energy Dependence of Galactic Cosmic Ray Anisotropies in the Very Local Interstellar Medium,"
Abstract:  We report on the energy dependence of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in the very
local interstellar medium (VLISM) as measured by the Low Energy Charged
Particle (LECP) instrument on the Voyager 1 (V1) spacecraft. The LECP
instrument includes a dual-ended solid state detector particle telescope
mechanically scanning through 360 deg across eight equally-spaced angular
sectors. As reported previously, LECP measurements showed a dramatic increase
in GCR intensities for all sectors of the >=211 MeV count rate (CH31) at the V1
heliopause (HP) crossing in 2012, however, since then the count rate data have
demonstrated systematic episodes of intensity decrease for particles around
90 pitch angle. To shed light on the energy dependence of these GCR
anisotropies over a wide range of energies, we use V1 LECP count rate and pulse
height analyzer (PHA) data from >=211 MeV channel together with lower energy
LECP channels. Our analysis shows that while GCR anisotropies are present over
a wide range of energies, there is a decreasing trend in the amplitude of
second-order anisotropy with increasing energy during anisotropy episodes. A
stronger pitch-angle scattering at the higher velocities is argued as a
potential cause for this energy dependence. A possible cause for this velocity
dependence arising from weak rigidity dependence of the scattering mean free
path and resulting velocity-dominated scattering rate is discussed. This
interpretation is consistent with a recently reported lack of corresponding GCR
electron anisotropies.

Abstract:  Over the last 25 years, radiowave detection of neutrino-generated signals,
using cold polar ice as the neutrino target, has emerged as perhaps the most
promising technique for detection of extragalactic ultra-high energy neutrinos
(corresponding to neutrino energies in excess of 0.01 Joules, or $10^{17}$

approximately linear dependence of $L_\alpha$ on frequency with the best fit of
the average field attenuation for the upper 1500 m of ice: $\langle L_\alpha
\rangle = \big( (1154 \pm 121) - (0.81 \pm 0.14) (\nu/$MHz$)\big)$ m for

Abstract:  The observed diversity in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) -- the thermonuclear
explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars used as cosmological standard
candles -- is currently met with a variety of explosion models and progenitor
scenarios. To help improve our understanding of whether and how often different
models contribute to the occurrence of SNe Ia and their assorted properties, we
present a comprehensive analysis of seven nearby SNe Ia. We obtained one to two
epochs of optical spectra with Gemini Observatory during the nebular phase
($>$200 days past peak) for each of these events, all of which had time-series
of photometry and spectroscopy at early times (the first $\sim$8 weeks after
explosion). We use the combination of early- and late-time observations to
assess the predictions of various models for the explosion (e.g.,
double-detonation, off-center detonation, stellar collisions), progenitor star
(e.g., ejecta mass, metallicity), and binary companion (e.g., another white
dwarf or a non-degenerate star). Overall, we find general consistency in our
observations with spherically-symmetric models for SN Ia explosions, and with
scenarios in which the binary companion is another degenerate star. We also
present an in-depth analysis of SN 2017fzw, a member of the sub-group of SNe Ia
which appear to be transitional between the subluminous ""91bg-like"" events and
normal SNe Ia, and for which nebular-phase spectra are rare.

"Title:An Overview of CHIME, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment","
Abstract:  The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a drift scan
radio telescope operating across the 400-800 MHz band. CHIME is located at the
Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory near Penticton, BC Canada. The
instrument is designed to map neutral hydrogen over the redshift range 0.8 to
2.5 to constrain the expansion history of the Universe. This goal drives the
design features of the instrument. CHIME consists of four parallel cylindrical
reflectors, oriented north-south, each 100 m $\times$ 20 m and outfitted with a
256 element dual-polarization linear feed array. CHIME observes a two degree
wide stripe covering the entire meridian at any given moment, observing 3/4 of
the sky every day due to Earth rotation. An FX correlator utilizes FPGAs and
GPUs to digitize and correlate the signals, with different correlation products
generated for cosmological, fast radio burst, pulsar, VLBI, and 21 cm absorber
backends. For the cosmology backend, the $N_\mathrm{feed}^2$ correlation matrix
is formed for 1024 frequency channels across the band every 31 ms. A data
receiver system applies calibration and flagging and, for our primary
cosmological data product, stacks redundant baselines and integrates for 10 s.
We present an overview of the instrument, its performance metrics based on the
first three years of science data, and we describe the current progress in
characterizing CHIME's primary beam response. We also present maps of the sky
derived from CHIME data; we are using versions of these maps for a cosmological
stacking analysis as well as for investigation of Galactic foregrounds.

Title:Non-Gaussian Effects of the Saha's Ionization in the Early Universe,"
Abstract:  Tsallis' thermostatistical has received increasing attention due to its
success in describing phenomena that manifest unusual thermodynamic properties.
In this context, the generalized Saha equation must follow a condition of
generalized thermal equilibrium of matter and radiation. The present work aims
to explore the non-Gaussian effects on Saha's ionization via Tsallis
statistics. To accomplish this, we generalized the number density taking into
account a non-Gaussian Fermi-Dirac distribution, and then set out the Saha
equation for the cosmological recombination. As a result, we highlight two new
non-Gaussian effects: $i$) two generalized chemical equilibrium conditions, one
for the relativistic regime and the other for the non-relativistic one; and
$ii$) the hydrogen binding $q$-energy. We demonstrated that to yields smooth
shifts in the binding energy, the $a$-parameter must be very small. We also
showed that binding $q$-energy exhibits symmetrical behavior around the value
of the standard binding energy. Besides, we used the $q$-energy in order to
access other hydrogen energy levels, and we ascertained the values of the
$a$-parameter that access those levels and their relationship to temperature.
Finally, we employed these results to examine the non-Gaussian effects of the
deuterium bottleneck, recombination and the particle anti-particle excess.

that used data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope through the end of the
calendar year 2020. We discuss the various types of science programs and
science categories that were used to collect data during the mission and
discuss how operational changes brought on by the depletion of cryogen in May
2009, including the resulting budget cuts, impacted the publication rate. The
post-cryogenic (warm) mission produced fewer papers than the cryogenic mission,
but the percentage of the exposure time published did not appreciably change
between the warm and cryogenic missions. This was mostly because in the warm
mission the length of observations increased, so that each warm paper on
average uses more data than the cryogenic papers. We also discuss the speed of
publication, archival usage, and the tremendous efficacy of the Legacy and
Exploration Science programs (large, coherent investigations), including the
value of having well-advertised enhanced data products hosted in centralized
archives. We also identify the observations that have been published the
largest number of times, and sort them by a variety of metrics (including
program type, instrument used, and observation length). Data that have the
highest reuse rates in publications were taken early in the Spitzer mission, or
belong to one of the large surveys (large either in number of objects, in
number of hours observed, or in area covered on the sky). We also assess how
often authors have cited the Spitzer fundamental papers or have correctly
referenced the Spitzer data they used, finding that as many as 40% of papers
have failed to cite the papers, and 15% have made it impossible to identify the

Title:Decomposing Magnetic Fields in Three Dimensions over the Central Molecular Zone,"
Abstract:  Measuring magnetic fields in the interstellar medium and obtaining their
distribution along line-of-sight is very challenging with the traditional
techniques. The Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT), which utilizes anisotropy of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, provides an attractive solution.
Targeting the central molecular zone (CMZ), we test this approach by applying
the VGT to $\rm ^{12}CO$ and $\rm ^{13}CO$ (J = 1-0) data cubes. We first used
the SCOUSEPY algorithm to decompose the CO line emissions into separate
velocity components, and then we constructed pseudo-Stokes parameters via the
VGT to map the plane-of-the-sky magnetic fields in three-dimension. We present
the decomposed magnetic field maps and investigate their significance. While
the line-of-sight integrated magnetic field orientation is shown to be
consistent with the polarized dust emission from the Planck survey at 353 GHz,
individual velocity components may exhibit different magnetic fields. We
present a scheme of magnetic field configuration in the CMZ based on the
decomposed magnetic fields. In particular, we observe a nearly vertical
magnetic field orientation in the dense clump near the Sgr B2 and a change in
the outflow regions around the Sgr A*. Two high-velocity structures associated
with an expanding ring in the CMZ show distinct swirling magnetic field
structures. These results demonstrate the potential power of the VGT to
decompose velocity or density-dependent magnetic structures.

Title:V608 Cassiopeiae: A W UMa-type eclipsing binary with two possible circumbinary companions,"
Abstract:  We present the photometric properties of V608 Cas from detailed studies of
light curves and eclipse timings. The light curve synthesis indicates that the
eclipsing pair is an overcontact binary with parameters of $\Delta T$ = 155 K,
$q$ = 0.328, and $f$ = 26 %. We detected the third light $\ell_{3}$, which
corresponds to about 8 % and 5 % of the total systemic light in $V$ and $R$
bands, respectively. Including our 6 timing measurements, a total of 38 times
of minimum light were used for a period study. It was found that the orbital
period of V608 Cas has varied in some combination of an upward parabola and two
periodic variations. The continuous period increase with a rate of
$+$3.99$\times$10$^{-7}$ d yr$^{-1}$ can be interpreted as a mass transfer from
the secondary component to the primary star at a rate of 1.51$\times$10$^{-7}$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The periods and semi-amplitudes of the two periodic
variations are about $P_3$ = 16.0 yr and $P_4$ = 26.3 yr, and $K_3$ = 0.0341 d
and $K_4$ = 0.0305 d, respectively. The most likely explanation of both cycles
is a pair of light-traveling time effects operated by the possible presence of
third and fourth components with estimated masses of $M_3$ = 2.20 M$_\odot$ and
$M_4$ = 1.27 M$_\odot$ in eccentric orbits of $e_3$ = 0.66 and $e_4$ = 0.52.
Because the contribution of $\ell_{3}$ is very low compared to the estimated
masses of two circumbinary objects, they can be inferred as very faint compact
objects.

Abstract:  The S-shaped magnetic structure in the solar wind formed by the twisting of
magnetic field lines is called a switchback, whose main characteristics are the

rotation of the switchbacks. The diameter of switchbacks is estimated with a
minimum variance analysis (MVA) method based on the assumption of a cylindrical
magnetic tube. We also make a comparison between switchbacks from inside and
the boundary of coronal holes. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) the
rotation angles of switchbacks observed during the first encounter seem larger
than those of the switchbacks observed during the second encounter in general;
(2) the tangential component of the velocity inside the switchbacks tends to be
more positive (westward) than in the ambient solar wind; (3) switchbacks are
more likely to rotate clockwise than anticlockwise, and the number of
switchbacks with clockwise rotation is 1.48 and 2.65 times of those with
anticlockwise rotation during the first and second encounters, respectively;
(4) the diameter of switchbacks is about 10^5 km on average and across five
orders of magnitude (10^3 -- 10^7 km).

Title:Terrestrial planet formation from lost inner solar system material,"
Abstract:  Two fundamentally different processes of rocky planet formation exist, but it
is unclear which one built the terrestrial planets of the solar system. Either
they formed by collisions among planetary embryos from the inner solar system,
or by accreting sunward-drifting millimeter-sized 'pebbles' from the outer
solar system. We show that the isotopic compositions of Earth and Mars are
governed by two-component mixing among inner solar system materials, including
material from the innermost disk unsampled by meteorites, whereas the
contribution of outer solar system material is limited to a few percent by
mass. This refutes a pebble accretion origin of the terrestrial planets, but is
consistent with collisional growth from inner solar system embryos. The low
fraction of outer solar system material in Earth and Mars indicates the
presence of a persistent dust-drift barrier in the disk, highlighting the
specific pathway of rocky planet formation in the solar system.

first detection of the [OI] and (tentatively) [NII] emission lines in
J1148+5251. Using Fine Structure Lines (FSL) ratios of the [CII], [NII], [OI]
and previously measured [CI] emission lines, we show that J1148+5251 has
similar ISM conditions compared to lower--redshift (ultra)-luminous infrared
galaxies. CLOUDY modelling of the FSL ratios exclude X--ray dominated regions
(XDR) and favours photodissociation regions (PDR) as the origin of the FSL
emission. We find that a high radiation field ($10^{3.5-4.5}\,G_0$), high gas
density ($n \simeq 10^{3.5-4.5}\, \rm{cm}^{-3}$) and HI column density of
$10^{23} \,\rm{cm^{-2}}$ reproduce the observed FSL ratios well.

Title:Discovery of a highly magnetic He-sdO star from a double-degenerate binary merger,"
Abstract:  Helium-rich hot subdwarf stars of spectral type O (He-sdO) are considered
prime candidates for stellar merger remnants. Such events should lead to the
generation of strong magnetic fields. However, no magnetic He-sdO has yet been
unambiguously discovered despite the high magnetic rate (20%) among white dwarf
stars, the progeny of hot subdwarfs. Here we present the discovery of a strong
magnetic field (B = 353 $\pm$ 10 kG) from Zeeman-split hydrogen, helium, and
metal lines in the optical X-SHOOTER spectrum of an He-sdO and present the
first spectroscopic analysis of any magnetic hot subdwarf. For this we used
line-blanketed Tlusty non-local thermodynamic equilibrium models and assumed a
simple homogeneous magnetic field. The derived atmospheric parameters
$T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 44900 $\pm$ 1000 K and log g = 5.93 $\pm$ 0.15 are typical
for He-sdO stars, while the star is less hydrogen-poor than most He-sdOs at log
n(He)/n(H) = +0.28 $\pm$ 0.10. The star is a slow rotator ($v_\mathrm{rot}\sin
i$ < 40 km s$^{-1}$). Its chemical composition is N-rich and C- and O-poor, and
the Si and S abundances are close to solar. Combining the atmospheric
parameters with Gaia parallax and photometry, the stellar radius and luminosity
are found to be typical for He-sdOs and place the star on the helium main
sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Its mass of $0.93^{+0.44}_{-0.30}$
$M_\odot$, although uncertain, appears to be remarkably high. The strong
magnetic field along with the atmospheric parameters and metal abundances
provide overwhelming evidence for the double-degenerate merger scenario.

Title:TeV and keV-MeV Excesses as Probes for Hadronic Process in BL Lacertaes,"
Abstract:  A hard TeV $\gamma$-ray component excess over the single-zone leptonic model
prediction (TeV excess) is observed in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
of some BL Lacs. Its origin is uncertain. We revisit this issue with four BL
Lacs (1ES 0229+200, 1ES 0347--121, 1ES 1101--232, and H2356--309), in which the
TeV excess is detected in their intrinsic SEDs. We represent their SEDs with a
single-zone leptohadronic model, where radiations of the electrons and protons
as well as the cascade electrons produced by the $\gamma\gamma$ and p$\gamma$
interactions within their jets are considered. We show that the observed SEDs
below the GeV gamma-ray band are attributed to the synchrotron radiations and
self-Compton process of the primary electrons, and the TeV excess is explained
with the $\gamma$-ray emission from the p$\gamma$ process via the $\pi^{0}$
decay. The cascade emission of the electrons produced via the $\gamma\gamma$
and p$\gamma$ interactions results in a keV-MeV excess in the SEDs, illustrated
as a bump or plateau. This extra photon field enhances the production of TeV
photons from the $p\gamma$ process, resulting in a reduction of the proton
power by about one order of magnitude. However, the derived powers are still
3--4 orders of magnitude larger than the Eddington limit, being challenged by
the current black hole accretion physics. Applying our model to Mrk 421, we
propose that synergic observations with current and upcoming TeV and keV-MeV
telescopes for its tentative TeV and MeV excesses can give insights to the
hadronic process in its jet.

Title:Parameterizing the Outflow from a Central Black Hole in Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies: A 3D Hydrodynamic Simulation,"
Abstract:  Large galaxies harbor massive central black holes and their feedback causes a
substantial impact in their evolution. Recently, observations suggested that
dwarf galaxies might host black holes in their centers, but with lower masses
(intermediate-mass black holes - IMBH). The impact of such IMBHs on the
evolution of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), however, has not been so
far properly analysed. In this work, we investigate the effects of an outflow
from an IMBH on the gas dynamics in dSph galaxies by means of non-cosmological,
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, letting the galactic gas
distribution evolve over 3 Gyr under the influence of the IMBH's outflow and
supernova feedback. All simulations have a numerical resolution of 20.0 pc
cell$^{-1}$. Two scenarios are considered to infer the differences in the
propagation of the outflow, one with a homogeneous ISM and another one with
inhomogeneities caused by supernovae feedback. A minimal initial speed and a
minimal initial density are required for the outflow to propagate, with the
values depending on the conditions of the medium. In an unperturbed medium, the
outflow propagates freely in both directions with the same velocity (lower than
the initial one), removing a small fraction of the gas from the galaxy (the
exact fraction depends on the initial physical conditions of the outflow).
However, in an inhomogeneous ISM, the impact of the outflow is substantially
reduced, and its contribution to the removal of gas from the galaxy is almost
negligible.

"Title:BeyondPlanck XIII. Intensity foreground sampling, degeneracies, and priors","
Abstract:  We present the intensity foreground algorithms and model employed within the
BeyondPlanck analysis framework. The BeyondPlanck analysis is aimed at
integrating component separation and instrumental parameter sampling within a
global framework, leading to complete end-to-end error propagation in the
$Planck$ Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) data analysis. Given the scope of the
BeyondPlanck analysis, a limited set of data is included in the component
separation process, leading to foreground parameter degeneracies. In order to
properly constrain the Galactic foreground parameters, we improve upon the
previous $\texttt{Commander}$ component separation implementation by adding a
suite of algorithmic techniques. These algorithms are designed to improve the
stability and computational efficiency for weakly constrained posterior
distributions. These are: 1) joint foreground spectral parameter and amplitude
sampling, building on ideas from Miramare; 2) component-based monopole
determination; 3) joint spectral parameter and monopole sampling; and 4)
application of informative spatial priors for component amplitude maps. We find
that the only spectral parameter with a significant signal-to-noise ratio using
the current BeyondPlanck data set is the peak frequency of the anomalous
microwave emission component, for which we find $\nu_{\mathrm{p}}=25.3\pm0.5$
GHz; all others must be constrained through external priors. Future works will
be aimed at integrating many more data sets into this analysis, both map and
time-ordered based, thereby gradually eliminating the currently observed
degeneracies in a controlled manner with respect to both instrumental
systematic effects and astrophysical degeneracies. When this happens, the
simple LFI-oriented data model employed in the current work will need to be
generalized to account for both a richer astrophysical model and additional
instrumental effects.

Title:Machine Learning to Decipher the Astrophysical Processes at Cosmic Dawn,"
Abstract:  The cosmic 21-cm line of hydrogen is expected to be measured in detail by the
next generation of radio telescopes. The enormous dataset from future 21-cm
surveys will revolutionize our understanding of early cosmic times. We present
a machine learning approach that uses emulation in order to uncover the
astrophysics in the epoch of reionization and cosmic dawn. Using a
seven-parameter astrophysical model that covers a very wide range of possible
21-cm signals, over the redshift range $6$ to $30$ and wavenumber range $0.05 \
\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $1 \ \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ we emulate the 21-cm power spectrum with
a typical accuracy of $10 - 20\%$. As a realistic example, we train an emulator
using the 21-cm power spectrum with an optimistic model for observational noise
as expected for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Fitting to mock SKA data
results in a typical measurement accuracy of $5\%$ in the optical depth to the
CMB, $30\%$ in the star-formation efficiency of galactic halos, and a factor of
$3.5$ in the X-ray efficiency of galactic halos; the latter two parameters are
currently uncertain by orders of magnitude. In addition to standard
astrophysical models, we also consider two exotic possibilities of strong
excess radio backgrounds at high redshifts. We use a neural network to identify
the type of radio background present in the 21-cm power spectrum, with an
accuracy of $87\%$ for mock SKA data.

Title:Shallowness of circulation in hot Jupiters -- Advancing the Ohmic dissipation model,"
Abstract:  The inflated radii of giant short-period extrasolar planets collectively
indicate that the interiors of hot Jupiters are heated by some anomalous energy
dissipation mechanism. Although a variety of physical processes have been
proposed to explain this heating, recent statistical evidence points to the
confirmation of explicit predictions of the Ohmic dissipation theory, elevating
this mechanism as the most promising candidate for resolving the radius
inflation problem. In this work, we present an analytic model for the
dissipation rate and derive a simple scaling law that links the magnitude of
energy dissipation to the thickness of the atmospheric weather layer. From this
relation, we find that the penetration depth influences the Ohmic dissipation
rate by an order of magnitude. We further investigate the weather layer depth
of hot Jupiters from the extent of their inflation and show that, depending on
the magnetic field strength, hot Jupiter radii can be maintained even if the
circulation layer is relatively shallow. Additionally, we explore the evolution
of zonal wind velocities with equilibrium temperature by matching our analytic
model to statistically expected dissipation rates. From this analysis, we
deduce that the wind speed scales approximately as
$1/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{eq}-T_0}$, where $T_0$ is a constant that equals $T_0 \sim
1000~\mathrm{K}-1800~\mathrm{K}$ depending on planet-specific parameters
(radius, mass, etc.). This work outlines inter-related constraints on the
atmospheric flow and the magnetic field of hot Jupiters and provides a
foundation for future work on the Ohmic heating mechanism.

Title:Optical Observations of star clusters NGC 1513 and NGC 4147; white dwarf WD1145+017 and $K$ band imaging of star forming region Sh2-61 with the 3.6 meter Devasthal Optical Telescope,"
Abstract:  The $UBVRI$ CCD photometric data of open star cluster NGC 1513 are obtained
with the 3.6-m Indo-Belgian Devasthal optical telescope (DOT). Analyses of the
GAIA EDR3 astrometric data have identified 106 possible cluster members. The
mean proper motion of the cluster is estimated as
$\mu_{\alpha}Cos{\delta}=1.29\pm0.02$ and $\mu_{\delta}=-3.74\pm0.02$ mas
yr$^{-1}$. Estimated values of reddening $E(B-V)$ and distance to the NGC 1513
are 0.65$\pm$0.03 mag and 1.33$\pm$0.1 kpc respectively. An age of $225\pm25$
Myr is assigned to the cluster by comparing theoretical isochrones with deep
observed cluster sequence. Using observations taken with the 3.6-m DOT, values
of distance and age of the galactic globular cluster NGC 4147 are estimated as
$18.2\pm0.2$ Kpc and $14\pm2$ Gyr respectively. The optical observations of
planetary transit around white dwarf WD1145+017 and $K$-band imaging of
star-forming region Sharpless Sh 2-61 demonstrate observing capability of 3.6-m
DOT. Optical and near-infrared observations of celestial objects and events are
being carried out routinely with the 3.6-m DOT. They indicate that the
performance of the telescope is at par with those of other similar telescopes
located elsewhere in the world. We therefore state that this observing facility
augurs well for multi-wavelength astronomy including study of astrophysical
jets.

Title:Comparing weak lensing peak counts in baryonic correction models to hydrodynamical simulations,"
Abstract:  Next-generation weak lensing (WL) surveys, such as by the Vera Rubin
Observatory's LSST, the $\textit{Roman}$ Space Telescope, and the
$\textit{Euclid}$ space mission, will supply vast amounts of data probing
small, highly nonlinear scales. Extracting information from these scales
requires higher-order statistics and the controlling of related systematics
such as baryonic effects. To account for baryonic effects in cosmological
analyses at reduced computational cost, semi-analytic baryonic correction
models (BCMs) have been proposed. Here, we study the accuracy of BCMs for WL
peak counts, a well studied, simple, and effective higher-order statistic. We
compare WL peak counts generated from the full hydrodynamical simulation
IllustrisTNG and a baryon-corrected version of the corresponding dark
matter-only simulation IllustrisTNG-Dark. We apply galaxy shape noise expected
at the depths reached by DES, KiDS, HSC, LSST, $\textit{Roman}$, and
$\textit{Euclid}$. We find that peak counts in BCMs are (i) accurate at the
percent level for peaks with $\mathrm{S/N}<4$, (ii) statistically
indistinguishable from IllustrisTNG in most current and ongoing surveys, but
(iii) insufficient for deep future surveys covering the largest solid angles,
such as LSST and $\textit{Euclid}$. We find that BCMs match individual peaks
accurately, but underpredict the amplitude of the highest peaks. We conclude
that existing BCMs are a viable substitute for full hydrodynamical simulations
in cosmological parameter estimation from beyond-Gaussian statistics for
ongoing and future surveys with modest solid angles. For the largest surveys,
BCMs need to be refined to provide a more accurate match, especially to the
highest peaks.

Abstract:  Microlensing events have historically been discovered throughout the Galactic
bulge and plane by surveys designed solely for that purpose. We conduct the
first multi-year search for microlensing events on the Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF), an all-sky optical synoptic survey that observes the entire
visible Northern sky every few nights. We discover 128 high quality
microlensing events in the three years of ZTF-I using the bulk lightcurves in
the ZTF Public Data Release 5. We find an excess of long-duration Galactic
plane events when comparing our results to both previous surveys and
simulations. 35 of our events are found outside of the Galactic plane ($|b|
\geq 15^\circ$), nearly tripling the number of previously discovered events in
the stellar halo from surveys pointed toward the Magellanic Clouds and the
Andromeda Galaxy. We also record 1690 ongoing candidate events as potential
microlensing that can continue to be observed by ZTF-II for identification. The
scalable and computationally efficient methods developed in this work can be
applied to future synoptic surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy
Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope as they
attempt to find microlensing events in even larger and deeper datasets.

parameters are analyzed for ${\sim} 8,000$ metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] $\leq

Selected as metal-poor candidates based on broadband photometry, RAVE collected
moderate-resolution ($R \sim 7,500$) spectra in the region of the Ca triplet
for these stars. About $20\%$ of the stars in this sample also have
medium-resolution ($1,200 \lesssim R \lesssim 2,000$) validation spectra
obtained over a four-year campaign from $2014$ to $2017$ with a variety of
telescopes. We match the candidate stars to photometric metallicity
determinations from the Huang et al. recalibration of the Sky Mapper Southern
Survey Data Release 2. We obtain dynamical clusters of these stars from the
orbital energy and cylindrical actions using the \HDBSCAN ~unsupervised
learning algorithm. We identify $179$ Dynamically Tagged Groups (DTGs) with
between $5$ and $35$ members; $67$ DTGs have at least $10$ member stars. Milky
Way (MW) substructures such as Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, the Metal-Weak Thick
Disk, the Splashed Disk, Thamnos, the Helmi Stream, and LMS-1 (Wukong) are
identified. Associations with MW globular clusters are determined for $10$
DTGs; no recognized MW dwarf galaxies were associated with any of our DTGs.
Previously identified dynamical groups are also associated with our DTGs, with
emphasis placed on their structural determination and possible new
identifications. We identify chemically peculiar stars as members of several
DTGs; we find $22$ DTGs that are associated with \textit{r}-process-enhanced
stars. Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are identified among the targets
with available spectroscopy, and we assign these to morphological groups

Title:Magnetic Field Evolution in Neutron Star Crusts: Beyond the Hall Effect,"
Abstract:  Neutron stars host the strongest magnetic fields that we know of in the
Universe. Their magnetic fields are the main means of generating their
radiation, either magnetospheric or through the crust. Moreover, the evolution
of the magnetic field has been intimately related to explosive events of
magnetars, which host strong magnetic fields, and their persistent thermal
emission. The evolution of the magnetic field in the crusts of neutron stars
has been described within the framework of the Hall effect and Ohmic
dissipation. Yet, this description is limited by the fact that the Maxwell
stresses exerted on the crusts of strongly magnetised neutron stars may lead to
failure and temperature variations. In the former case, a failed crust does not
completely fulfil the necessary conditions for the Hall effect. In the latter,
the variations of temperature are strongly related to the magnetic field
evolution. Finally, sharp gradients of the star's temperature may activate
battery terms and alter the magnetic field structure, especially in weakly
magnetised neutron stars. In this review, we discuss the recent progress made
on these effects. We argue that these phenomena are likely to provide novel
insight into our understanding of neutron stars and their observable
properties.

Title:Accurate modeling of grazing transits using umbrella sampling,"
Abstract:  Grazing transits present a special problem for statistical studies of
exoplanets. Even though grazing planetary orbits are rare (due to geometric
selection effects), for many low to moderate signal-to-noise cases, a
significant fraction of the posterior distribution is nonetheless consistent
with a grazing geometry. A failure to accurately model grazing transits can
therefore lead to biased inferences even for cases where the planet is not
actually on a grazing trajectory. With recent advances in stellar
characterization, the limiting factor for many scientific applications is now
the quality of available transit fits themselves, and so the time is ripe to
revisit the transit fitting problem. In this paper, we model exoplanet transits
using a novel application of umbrella sampling and a geometry-dependent
parameter basis that minimizes covariances between transit parameters. Our
technique splits the transit fitting problem into independent Monte Carlo
sampling runs for the grazing, non-grazing, and transition regions of the
parameter space, which we then recombine into a single joint posterior
probability distribution using a robust weighting scheme. Our method can be
trivially parallelized and so requires no increase in the wall clock time
needed for computations. Most importantly, our method produces accurate
estimates of exoplanet properties for both grazing and non-grazing orbits,
yielding more robust results than standard methods for many common star-planet
configurations.

Title:Compact groups from semi-analytical models of galaxy formation -- III: purity and completeness of Hickson-like catalogues,"
Abstract:  Many catalogues of isolated compact groups of galaxies (CGs) have been
extracted using Hickson's criteria to identify isolated, dense systems of
galaxies, with at least three or four galaxies concordant in magnitude and
redshift. But is not clear to what extent the catalogues of CGs are complete
and reliable, relative to 3D truly isolated, dense groups. Using five different
semi-analytical models of galaxy formation (SAMs), we identify isolated dense
groups in 3D real space, containing at least three galaxies. We then build mock
redshift space galaxy catalogues and run a Hickson-like CG finder. We find that
the Hickson-like algorithm in redshift space is poor at recovering 3D CGs of at
least 3 galaxies, with a purity of $\sim 10\%$ and a completeness of $\sim
22\%$. Among the $\sim 90\%$ of spurious systems, typically $60\%$ are dense
structures that failed the 3D isolation criteria, while the remaining $40\%$
are chance alignments of galaxies along the line of sight, nearly all of which
are within regular groups, with some variation with the SAM used for the
analysis. In other words, while only $10\%$ of CGs are isolated dense groups,
as intended, half are dense structures embedded within larger groups, and
one-third are chance alignments within larger groups. The low completeness of
the extracted CG sample is mainly due to the flux limits of the selection
criteria. Our results suggest that a new observational algorithm to identify
compact groups in redshift space is required to obtain dense isolated galaxy
systems.

Title:Photochemical Runaway in Exoplanet Atmospheres: Implications for Biosignatures,"
Abstract:  About 2.5 billion years ago, microbes learned to harness plentiful solar
energy to reduce CO$_2$ with H$_2$O, extracting energy and producing O$_2$ as
waste. O$_2$ production from this metabolic process was so vigorous that it
saturated its photochemical sinks, permitting it to reach ""runaway"" conditions
and rapidly accumulate in the atmosphere despite its reactivity. Here we argue
that O$_2$ may not be unique: diverse gases produced by life may experience a
""runaway"" effect similar to O$_2$. This runaway occurs because the ability of
an atmosphere to photochemically cleanse itself of trace gases is generally
finite. If produced at rates exceeding this finite limit, even reactive gases
can rapidly accumulate to high concentrations and become potentially
detectable. Planets orbiting smaller, cooler stars, such as the M dwarfs that
are the prime targets for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), are especially
favorable for runaway due to their lower UV emission compared to higher-mass
stars. As an illustrative case study, we show that on a habitable exoplanet
with an H$_2$-N$_2$ atmosphere and net surface production of NH$_3$ orbiting an
M dwarf (the ""Cold Haber World"" scenario), the reactive biogenic gas NH$_3$ can
enter runaway, whereupon an increase in the surface production flux of one
order of magnitude can increase NH$_3$ concentrations by three orders of
magnitude and render it detectable by JWST in just two transits. Our work on
this and other gases suggests that diverse signs of life on exoplanets may be
readily detectable at biochemically plausible production rates.

Title:Simulations of AGN Driven Galactic Outflow Morphology and Content,"
Abstract:  Using a series of 3D relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of active
galactic nuclei (AGN) we investigate how AGN power, a clumpy ISM structure, and
AGN jet angle with respect to the galactic disk affect the morphology and
content of the resulting galactic outflow. For low power AGN across three
orders of magnitude of AGN luminosities ($10^{41}-10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) our
simulations did not show significant changes to either the morphology or total
mass of the outflow. Changing the angle of the AGN jet with respect to the
galaxy did show small changes in the total outflow mass of a factor of 2-3.
Jets perpendicular to the galactic disk were created hot single phase outflows,
while jets close to parallel with the disk created the outflows were
multi-phase with equal parts warm and hot, and significant cold gas. Overall
The final morphology of low power AGN outflows depends primarily on how the jet
impacts and interacts with large, dense clouds in the clumpy ISM. These clouds
can disrupt, deflect, split, or suppress the jet preventing it from leaving the
galactic disk as a coherent structure. But for simulations with AGN
luminosities $> 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ the ISM played a minor role in
determining the morphology of the outflow with an undisrupted jet leaving the
disk. The final morphology of AGN outflows is different for low power AGNs vs.
high power AGNs with the final morphology of low power AGN outflows dependent
on the ISM structure within the first kpc surrounding the AGN.

"Title:Planet populations inferred from debris discs: insights from 178 debris systems in the ISPY, LEECH and LIStEN planet-hunting surveys","
Abstract:  We know little about the outermost exoplanets in planetary systems, because
our detection methods are insensitive to moderate-mass planets on wide orbits.
However, debris discs can probe the outer-planet population, because dynamical
modelling of observed discs can reveal properties of perturbing planets. We use
four sculpting and stirring arguments to infer planet properties in 178
debris-disc systems from the ISPY, LEECH and LIStEN planet-hunting surveys.
Similar analyses are often conducted for individual discs, but we consider a
large sample in a consistent manner. We aim to predict the population of
wide-separation planets, gain insight into the formation and evolution
histories of planetary systems, and determine the feasibility of detecting
these planets in the near future. We show that a `typical' cold debris disc
likely requires a Neptune- to Saturn-mass planet at 10-100 au, with some
needing Jupiter-mass perturbers. Our predicted planets are currently
undetectable, but modest detection-limit improvements (e.g. from JWST) should
reveal many such perturbers. We find that planets thought to be perturbing
debris discs at late times are similar to those inferred to be forming in
protoplanetary discs, so these could be the same population if newly formed
planets do not migrate as far as currently thought. Alternatively, young
planets could rapidly sculpt debris before migrating inwards, meaning that the
responsible planets are more massive (and located further inwards) than
debris-disc studies assume. We combine self-stirring and size-distribution
modelling to show that many debris discs cannot be self-stirred without having
unreasonably high masses; planet- or companion-stirring may therefore be the
dominant mechanism in many (perhaps all) debris discs. Finally, we provide
catalogues of planet predictions, and identify promising targets for future
planet searches.

Abstract:  After observing WASP-12 in the second year of the primary mission, the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) revisited the system in late 2021

curve. We also present a new $K_s$-band occultation observation of WASP-12b
obtained with the Palomar/Wide-field Infrared Camera instrument. The latest
TESS photometry spans three consecutive months, quadrupling the total length of
the TESS WASP-12 light curve and extending the overall time baseline by almost
two years. Based on the full set of available transit and occultation timings,
we find that the orbital period is shrinking at a rate of $-29.81 \pm 0.94$ ms
yr$^{-1}$. The additional data also increase the measurement precision of the
transit depth, orbital parameters, and phase-curve amplitudes. We obtain a
secondary eclipse depth of $466 \pm 35$ ppm, a $2\sigma$ upper limit on the
nightside brightness of 70 ppm, and a marginal $6\overset{\circ}{.}2 \pm
2\overset{\circ}{.}8$ eastward offset between the dayside hotspot and the
substellar point. The voluminous TESS dataset allows us to assess the level of
atmospheric variability on timescales of days, months, and years. We do not
detect any statistically significant modulations in the secondary eclipse depth
or day-night brightness contrast. Likewise, our measured $K_s$-band occultation
depth of $2810 \pm 390$ ppm is consistent with most $\sim$2.2 $\mu$m

"Title:Stellar masses, sizes, and radial profiles for 465 nearby early-type galaxies: an extension to the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^{4}$G)","
Abstract:  The Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^{4}$G) is a detailed
study of over 2300 nearby galaxies in the near-infrared (NIR), which has been
critical to our understanding of the detailed structures of nearby galaxies.
Because the sample galaxies were selected only using radio-derived velocities,
however, the survey favored late-type disk galaxies over lenticulars and
ellipticals. A follow-up Spitzer survey was conducted to rectify this bias,
adding 465 early-type galaxies (ETGs) to the original sample, to be analyzed in
a manner consistent with the initial survey. We present the data release of
this ETG extension, up to the third data processing pipeline (P3): surface
photometry. We produce curves of growth and radial surface brightness profiles
(with and without inclination corrections) using reduced and masked Spitzer
IRAC 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m images produced through Pipelines 1 and 2,
respectively. From these profiles, we derive the following integrated
quantities: total magnitudes, stellar masses, concentration parameters, and
galaxy size metrics. We showcase NIR scaling relations for ETGs among these
quantities. We examine general trends across the whole S$^{4}$G and ETG
extension among our derived parameters, highlighting differences between ETGs
and late-type galaxies (LTGs). ETGs are, on average, more massive and more
concentrated than LTGs, and also show subtle distinctions among ETG
morphological sub-types. We also derive the following scaling relations and
compare with previous results in visible light: mass--size (both half-light and
isophotal), mass--concentration, mass--surface brightness (central, effective,
and within 1 kpc), and mass--color. We find good agreement with previous works,
though some relations (e.g., mass--central surface brightness) will require
more careful multi-component decompositions to be fully understood.

Title:Oxygen-enhanced extremely metal-poor DLAs: A signpost of the first stars?,"
Abstract:  We present precise abundance determinations of two near-pristine damped
Ly$\alpha$ systems (DLAs) to assess the nature of the [O/Fe] ratio at [Fe/H] <
-3 (i.e. <1/1000 of the solar metallicity). Prior observations indicate that
the [O/Fe] ratio is consistent with a constant value, [O/Fe] ~ +0.4, when -3 <
[Fe/H] < -2, but this ratio may increase when [Fe/H] < -3. In this paper, we
test this picture by reporting new, high-precision [O/Fe] abundances in two of
the most metal-poor DLAs currently known. We derive values of [O/Fe] = +0.50
+/- 0.10 and [O/Fe] = +0.62 +/- 0.05 for these two z ~ 3 near-pristine gas
clouds. These results strengthen the idea that the [O/Fe] abundances of the
most metal-poor DLAs are elevated compared to DLAs with [Fe/H] > -3. We compare
the observed abundance pattern of the latter system to the nucleosynthetic
yields of Population III supernovae (SNe), and find that the enrichment can be
described by a (19-25) M$_{\odot}$ Population III SN that underwent a
(0.9-2.4)$\times 10^{51}$ erg explosion. These high-precision measurements
showcase the behaviour of [O/Fe] in the most metal-poor environments. Future
high-precision measurements in new systems will contribute to a firm detection
of the relationship between [O/Fe] and [Fe/H]. These data will reveal whether
we are witnessing a chemical signature of enrichment from Population III stars
and allow us to rule out contamination from Population II stars.

Title:Black hole triggered star formation in the dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10,"
Abstract:  Black hole driven outflows have been observed in some dwarf galaxies with
active galactic nuclei (1), and likely play a role in heating and expelling gas
(thereby suppressing star formation), as they do in larger galaxies (2). The
extent to which black hole outflows can trigger star formation in dwarf
galaxies is unclear, because work in this area has hitherto focused on massive
galaxies and the observational evidence is scarce (3,4,5). Henize 2-10 is a
dwarf starburst galaxy previously reported to have a central massive black hole
(6,7,8,9), though that interpretation has been disputed since some aspects of
the observational evidence are also consistent with a supernova remnant
(10,11). At a distance of ~9 Mpc, it presents an opportunity to resolve the
central region and determine if there is evidence for a black hole outflow
impacting star formation. Here we report optical observations of Henize 2-10
with a linear resolution of a few parsecs. We find a ~150 pc long ionized
filament connecting the region of the black hole with a site of recent star
formation. Spectroscopy reveals a sinusoid-like position-velocity structure
that is well described by a simple precessing bipolar outflow. We conclude that
this black hole outflow triggered the star formation.

Title:Tidal disruption events in post-starburst galaxies: the importance of a complete stellar mass function,"
Abstract:  A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star is destroyed by the strong
tidal shear of a massive black hole (MBH). The accumulation of TDE observations
over the last years has revealed that post-starburst galaxies are significantly
overrepresented in the sample of TDE hosts. Here we address the post-starburst
preference by investigating the decline of TDE rates in a Milky-Way like
nuclear stellar cluster featuring either a monochromatic (1 M$\odot$) or a
complete, evolved stellar mass function. In the former case, the decline of TDE
rates with time is very mild, and generally up to a factor of a few in 10 Gyr.
Conversely, if a complete mass function is considered, a strong TDE burst over
the first 0.1-1 Gyr is followed by a considerable rate drop, by at least an
order of magnitude over 10 Gyr. The decline starts after a mass segregation
time-scale, and it is more pronounced assuming a more top-heavy initial mass
function and/or an initially denser nucleus. Our results thus suggest that the
post-starburst preference can be accounted for in realistic systems featuring a
complete stellar mass function, even in moderately dense galactic nuclei.
Overall, our findings support the idea that starbursting galactic nuclei are
characterized by a top-heavy initial mass function; we speculate that
accounting for this can reconcile the discrepancy between observed and
theoretically predicted TDE rates even in quiescent galaxies.

Title:The Evolution of AGN Activity in Brightest Cluster Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We present the results of an analysis of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE) observations on the full 2500 deg^2 South Pole Telescope (SPT)-SZ
cluster sample. We describe a process for identifying active galactic nuclei
(AGN) in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) based on WISE mid-infrared color and
redshift. Applying this technique to the BCGs of the SPT-SZ sample, we
calculate the AGN-hosting BCG fraction, which is defined as the fraction of
BCGs hosting bright central AGNs over all possible BCGs. Assuming {\bf an
evolving} single-burst stellar population model, we find statistically
significant evidence (>99.9%) for a mid-IR excess at high redshift compared to
low redshift, suggesting that the fraction of AGN-hosting BCGs increases with
redshift over the range of 0 < z < 1.3. The best-fit redshift trend of the
AGN-hosting BCG fraction has the form (1+z)^(4.1+/-1.0). These results are
consistent with previous studies in galaxy clusters as well as field galaxies.
One way to explain this result is that member galaxies at high redshift tend to
have more cold gas. While BCGs in nearby galaxy clusters grow mostly by dry
mergers with cluster members, leading to no increase in AGN activity, BCGs at
high redshift could primarily merge with gas-rich satellites, providing fuel
for feeding AGNs. If this observed increase in AGN activity is linked to
gas-rich mergers, rather than ICM cooling, we would expect to see an increase
in scatter in the P_cav vs L_cool relation at z > 1. Lastly, this work confirms
that the runaway cooling phase, as predicted by the classical cooling flow
model, in the Phoenix cluster is extremely rare and most BCGs have low
(relative to Eddington) black hole accretion rates.

Title:Evolution of Stellar Orbits Around Merging Massive Black-Hole Binary,"
Abstract:  We study the long-term orbital evolution of stars around a merging massive or
supermassive black-hole (BH) binary, taking into account the general
relativistic effect induced by the BH spin. When the BH spin is significant
compared to and misaligned with the binary orbital angular momentum, the
orbital axis ($\hat{\mathbf{l}}$) of the circumbinary star can undergo
significant evolution during the binary orbital decay driven by gravitational
radiation. Including the spin effect of the primary (more massive) BH, we find
that starting from nearly coplanar orbital orientations, the orbital axes
$\hat{\mathbf{l}}$ of circumbinary stars preferentially evolve towards the spin
direction after the merger of the BH binary, regardless of the initial BH spin
orientation. Such alignment phenomenon, i.e., small final misalignment angle
between $\hat{\mathbf{l}}$ and the spin axis of the remanent BH
$\hat{\mathbf{S}}$, can be understood analytically using the principle of
adiabatic invariance. For the BH binaries with extremely mass ratio
($m_2/m_1\lesssim0.01$), $\hat{\mathbf{l}}$ may experience more complicated
evolution as adiabatic invariance breaks down, but the trend of alignment still
works reasonably well when the initial binary spin-orbit angle is relatively
small. Our result suggests that the correlation between the orientations of
stellar orbits and the spin axis of the central BH could provide a potential
signature of the merger history of the massive BH.

Abstract:  The ShapeFit compression method has been shown to be a powerful tool to gain
cosmological information from galaxy power spectra in an effective,
model-independent way. Here we present its performance on the blind PT
challenge mock products presented in [1]. Choosing a set-up similar to that of
other participants to the blind challenge we obtained $\Delta \ln\left(10^{10}
A_s\right) = -0.018 \pm 0.014$, $\Delta \Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.0039 \pm 0.0021$
and $\Delta h =-0.0009 \pm 0.0034$, remaining below $2\sigma$ deviations for a
volume of $566 \left[ h^{-1}\mathrm{Gpc}\right]^3$. This corresponds to a
volume 10 times larger than the volume probed by future galaxy surveys. We also
present an analysis of these mocks oriented towards an actual data analysis
using the full redshift evolution, using all three redshift bins $z_1 = 0.38$,
$z_2=0.51$, and $z_3 = 0.61$, and exploring different set-ups to quantify the
impact of choices or assumptions on noise, bias, scale range, etc. We find
consistency across reasonable changes in set-up and across redshifts and that,
as expected, mapping the redshift evolution of clustering helps constraining
cosmological parameters within a given model.

Title:Simulated Bars May Be Shorter But Are Not Slower Than Observed: TNG50 vs. MaNGA,"
Abstract:  Galactic bars are prominent dynamical structures within disk galaxies whose
size, formation time, strength, and pattern speed influence the dynamical
evolution of their hosts galaxies. Yet, their formation and evolution in a
cosmological context is not well understood, as cosmological simulation studies
have been limited by the classic trade off between simulation volume and
resolution. Here we analyze barred disk galaxies in the cosmological
magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and quantitatively compare the
distributions of bar size and pattern speed to those from MaNGA observations at
$z=0$. TNG50 galaxies are selected to match the stellar mass and size
distributions of observed galaxies, to account for observational selection
effects. We find that the high-resolution of TNG50 yields bars with a wide
range of pattern speeds (including those with $\geq
40~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\,$\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$) and a mean value of
$\sim36~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}$ consistent with
observations within $6\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\,$\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$, in
contrast with previous lower-resolution cosmological simulations that produced
bars that were too slow. We find, however, that bars in TNG50 are on average
$\sim 35\%$ shorter than observed, although this discrepancy may partly reflect
remaining inconsistencies in the simulation-data comparison. This leads to
higher values of $\mathcal{R} = R_\mathrm{corot}/R_\mathrm{bar}$ in TNG50, but
points to simulated bars being `too short' rather than `too slow'. After
repeating the analysis on the lower-resolution run of the same simulation (with
the same physical model), we qualitatively reproduce the results obtained in
previous studies: this implies that, along with physical model variations,
numerical resolution effects may explain the previously found `slowness' of
simulated bars.

Title:The spins of compact objects born from helium stars in binary systems,"
Abstract:  The angular momentum (AM) content of massive stellar cores helps to determine
the natal spin rates of neutron stars and black holes. Asteroseismic
measurements of low-mass stars have proven that stellar cores rotate slower
than predicted by most prior work, so revised models are necessary. In this
work, we apply an updated AM transport model based on the Tayler instability to
massive helium stars in close binaries, in which tidal spin-up can greatly
increase the star's AM. Consistent with prior work, these stars can produce
highly spinning black holes upon core-collapse if the orbital period is less
than $P_{\rm orb} \lesssim \! 1 \, {\rm day}$. For neutron stars, we predict a
strong correlation between the pre-explosion mass and the neutron star rotation
rate, with millisecond periods ($P_{\rm NS} \lesssim 5 \, {\rm ms}$) only
achievable for massive ($M \gtrsim 10 \, M_\odot$) helium stars in tight
($P_{\rm orb} \lesssim 1 \, {\rm day}$) binaries. Finally, we discuss our
models in relation to type Ib/c supernovae, superluminous supernove, gamma-ray
bursts, and LIGO measurements of black hole spins. Our models are roughly
consistent with the rates and energetics of these phenomena, with the exception
of broad-lined Ic supernovae, whose high rates and ejecta energies are
difficult to explain.

Title:Pulsations of microwave emission from a solar flare in a twisted loop caused by intrinsic MHD oscillations,"
Abstract:  We present results revealing microwave pulsations produced in a model of a
flaring twisted solar coronal loop, without any external oscillatory driver.
Two types of oscillations are identified: slowly-decaying oscillations with a
period of about 70-75s and amplitude of about 5-10% seen in loops both with and
without energetic electrons, and oscillations with period of about 40s and
amplitude of a few tens of percent observed only in loops with energetic
electrons for about 100s after onset of fast energy release. We interpret the
longer-period oscillations as the result of a standing kink mode modulating the
average magnetic field strength in the loop, whilst the short-period
intermittent oscillations associated with energetic electrons are likely to be
produced by fast variations of the electric field which produces energetic
electrons in this scenario. The slowly-decaying oscillations can explain the
quasi-periodic pulsations often observed in the flaring corona.

Title:Prospects for water vapor detection in the atmospheres of temperate and arid rocky exoplanets around M-dwarf stars,"
Abstract:  Detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of temperate rocky exoplanets
would be a major milestone on the path towards characterization of exoplanet
habitability. Past modeling work has shown that cloud formation may prevent the
detection of water vapor on Earth-like planets with surface oceans using the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Here we analyze the potential for
atmospheric detection of H2O on a different class of targets: arid planets.
Using transit spectrum simulations, we show that atmospheric H2O may be easier
to be detected on arid planets with cold-trapped ice deposits on the surface,
because such planets will not possess thick H2O cloud decks that limit the
transit depth of spectral features. However, additional factors such as band
overlap with CO2 and other gases, extinction by mineral dust, overlap of
stellar and planetary H2O lines, and the ultimate noise floor obtainable by
JWST still pose important challenges. For this reason, combination of space-
and ground-based spectroscopic observations will be essential for reliable
detection of H2O on rocky exoplanets in the future.

Title:Observational Signatures of Black Hole Accretion: Rotating vs. Spherical Flows with Tilted Magnetic Fields,"
Abstract:  We study the observational signatures of magnetically arrested black hole
accretion with non-rotating inflow onto a rotating black hole; we consider a
range of angles between the black hole spin and the initial magnetic field
orientation. We compare the results of our General Relativistic
Magneto-Hydrodynamic simulations to more commonly used rotating initial
conditions and to the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87. We
find that the mm intensity images, polarization images, and synchrotron
emission spectra are very similar among the different simulations when
post-processed with the same electron temperature model; observational
differences due to different electron temperature models are significantly
larger than those due to the different realizations of magnetically arrested
accretion. The orientation of the mm synchrotron polarization is particularly
insensitive to the initial magnetic field orientation, the electron temperature
model, and the rotation of the inflowing plasma. The largest difference among
the simulations with different initial rotation and magnetic tilt is in the
strength and stability of the jet; spherical inflow leads to kink-unstable
jets. We discuss the implications of our results for current and future EHT
observations and for theoretical models of event-horizon-scale black hole
accretion.

Title:Observational signatures of stellar explosions driven by relativistic jets,"
Abstract:  The role of relativistic jets in unbinding the stellar envelope during a
supernova (SN) associated with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is unclear. To study
that, we explore observational signatures of stellar explosions that are driven
by jets. We focus on the final velocity distribution of the outflow in such
explosions and compare its observational imprints to SN/GRB data. We find that
jet driven explosions produce an outflow with a flat distribution of energy per
logarithmic scale of proper velocity. The flat distribution seems to be
universal as it is independent of the jet and the progenitor properties that we
explored. The velocity range of the flat distribution for typical GRB
parameters is $\gamma\beta \approx 0.03-3$, where $\gamma$ is the outflow
Lorentz factor and $\beta$ is its dimensionless velocity. A flat distribution
is seen also for collimated choked jets where the highest outflow velocity
decreases with the depth at which the jet is choked. Comparison to observations
of SN/GRBs rules out jets as the sole explosion source in these events.
Instead, in SN/GRB the collapsing star must deposit its energy into two
channels - a quasi-spherical (or wide angle) channel and a narrowly collimated
one. The former carries most of the energy and is responsible for the SN
sub-relativistic ejecta while the latter carries 0.01-0.1 of the total outflow
energy and is the source of the GRB. Intriguingly, the same two channels, with
a similar energy ratio, were seen in the binary neutron star merger GW170817,
suggesting that similar engines are at work in both phenomena.

Title:Did a close tidal encounter cause the Great Dimming of Betelgeuse?,"
Abstract:  We assess whether gravity darkening, induced by a tidal interaction during a
stellar fly-by, might be sufficient to explain the Great Dimming of Betelgeuse.
Adopting several simple approximations, we calculate the tidal deformation and
associated gravity darkening in a close tidal encounter, as well as the
reduction in the radiation flux as seen by a distant observer. We show that, in
principle, the duration and degree of the resulting stellar dimming can be used
to estimate the minimum pericenter separation and mass of a fly-by object,
which, even if it remains undetected otherwise, might be a black hole, neutron
star, or white dwarf. Our estimates show that, while such fly-by events may
occur in other astrophysical scenarios, where our analysis should be
applicable, they likely are not large enough to explain the Great Dimming of
Betelgeuse by themselves.

Title:Cosmic rays in molecular clouds probed by H$_{2}$ rovibrational lines -- Perspectives for the James Webb Space Telescope,"
Abstract:  Cosmic rays (CRs) at sub-TeV energies play a fundamental role in the chemical
and dynamical evolution of molecular clouds, as they control the ionisation,
dissociation, and excitation of H$_{2}$. Their characterisation is important
both for the interpretation of observations and for the development of
theoretical models. The methods used so far for estimating the CR ionisation
rate ($\zeta$) in molecular clouds have several limitations due to
uncertainties in the adopted chemical networks. We refine and extend the method
proposed by Bialy (2020) to estimate $\zeta$ by observing rovibrational
transitions of H$_{2}$ at near-infrared wavelengths, which are mainly excited
by secondary CR electrons. Combining models of interstellar CR propagation and
attenuation with the calculation of the expected secondary electron spectrum
and updated H$_{2}$ excitation cross sections by electron collisions, we derive
the intensity of the four H$_{2}$ rovibrational transitions observable in
dense, cold gas: (1-0)O(2), (1-0)Q(2), (1-0)S(0), and (1-0)O(4). The proposed
method allows the estimation of $\zeta$ for a given observed line intensity and
H$_{2}$ column density. We are also able to deduce the shape of the low-energy
CR proton spectrum impinging upon the molecular cloud. We present a look-up
plot and a web-based application that can be used to constrain the low-energy
spectral slope of the interstellar CR proton spectrum. We comment on the
capability of the James Webb Space Telescope to detect these near-infrared
H$_{2}$ lines, making it possible to derive for the first time spatial
variation of $\zeta$ in dense gas. Besides the implications for the
interpretation of the chemical-dynamic evolution of a molecular cloud, it will
be possible to test competing models of CR propagation and attenuation in the
interstellar medium, as well as compare CR spectra in different Galactic
regions.

Title:Deep Attention-Based Supernovae Classification of Multi-Band Light-Curves,"
Abstract:  In astronomical surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF),
supernovae (SNe) are relatively uncommon objects compared to other classes of
variable events. Along with this scarcity, the processing of multi-band
light-curves is a challenging task due to the highly irregular cadence, long
time gaps, missing-values, low number of observations, etc. These issues are
particularly detrimental for the analysis of transient events with SN-like
light-curves. In this work, we offer three main contributions. First, based on
temporal modulation and attention mechanisms, we propose a Deep Attention model
called TimeModAttn to classify multi-band light-curves of different SN types,
avoiding photometric or hand-crafted feature computations, missing-values
assumptions, and explicit imputation and interpolation methods. Second, we
propose a model for the synthetic generation of SN multi-band light-curves
based on the Supernova Parametric Model (SPM). This allows us to increase the
number of samples and the diversity of the cadence. The TimeModAttn model is
first pre-trained using synthetic light-curves in a semi-supervised learning
scheme. Then, a fine-tuning process is performed for domain adaptation. The
proposed TimeModAttn model outperformed a Random Forest classifier, increasing
the balanced-$F_1$score from $\approx.525$ to $\approx.596$. The TimeModAttn
model also outperformed other Deep Learning models, based on Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), in two scenarios: late-classification and
early-classification. Finally, we conduct interpretability experiments. High
attention scores are obtained for observations earlier than and close to the SN
brightness peaks, which are supported by an early and highly expressive learned
temporal modulation.

Title:Kronoseismology VI: Reading the recent history of Saturn's gravity field in its rings,"
Abstract:  Saturn's C ring contains multiple structures that appear to be density waves
driven by time-variable anomalies in the planet's gravitational field.
Semi-empirical extensions of density wave theory enable the observed wave
properties to be translated into information about how the pattern speeds and
amplitudes of these gravitational anomalies have changed over time. Combining
these theoretical tools with wavelet-based analyses of data obtained by the
Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft
reveals a suite of structures in Saturn's gravity field with azimuthal
wavenumber 3, rotation rates between 804 degrees/day and 842 degrees/day and
local gravitational potential amplitudes between 30 and 150 cm^2/s^2. Some of
these anomalies are transient, appearing and disappearing over the course of a
few Earth years, while others persist for decades. Most of these persistent
patterns appear to have roughly constant pattern speeds, but there is at least
one structure in the planet's gravitational field whose rotation rate steadily
increased between 1970 and 2010. This gravitational field structure appears to
induce two different asymmetries in the planet's gravity field, one with
azimuthal wavenumber 3 that rotates at roughly 810 degrees/day and another with
azimuthal wavenumber 1 rotating three times faster. The atmospheric processes
responsible for generating the latter pattern may involve solar tides.

Title:Linking the rates of neutron star binaries and short gamma-ray bursts,"
Abstract:  Short gamma-ray bursts are believed to be produced by both binary neutron
star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. We use current estimates
for the BNS and NSBH merger rates to calculate the fraction of observable short
gamma-ray bursts produced through each channel. This allows us to constrain
merger rates of BNS to $\mathcal{R}_{\rm{BNS}}=384^{+431}_{-213}{\rm{Gpc}^{-3}
\rm{yr}^{-1}}$ ($90\%$ credible interval), a $16\%$ decrease in the rate
uncertainties from the second LIGO--Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog,
GWTC-2. Assuming a top-hat emission profile with a large Lorentz factor, we
constrain the average opening angle of gamma-ray burst jets produced in BNS
mergers to $\approx 15^\circ$. We also measure the fraction of BNS and NSBH
mergers that produce an observable short gamma-ray burst to be
$0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ and $0.01 \pm 0.01$, respectively and find that $\gtrsim
40\%$ of BNS mergers launch jets (90\% confidence). We forecast constraints for
future gravitational-wave detections given different modelling assumptions,
including the possibility that BNS and NSBH jets are different. With $24$ BNS
and $55$ NSBH observations, expected within six months of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA
network operating at design sensitivity, it will be possible to constrain the
fraction of BNS and NSBH mergers that launch jets with $10\%$ precision. Within
a year of observations, we can determine whether the jets launched in NSBH
mergers have a different structure than those launched in BNS mergers and rule
out whether $\gtrsim 80\%$ of binary neutron star mergers launch jets. We
discuss the implications of future constraints on understanding the physics of
short gamma-ray bursts and binary evolution.

"Title:Inference of bipolar neutrino flavor oscillations near a core-collapse supernova, based on multiple measurements at Earth","
Abstract:  Neutrinos in compact-object environments, such as core-collapse supernovae,
can experience various kinds of collective effects in flavor space, engendered
by neutrino-neutrino interactions. These include ""bipolar"" collective
oscillations, which are exhibited by neutrino ensembles where different flavors
dominate at different energies. Considering the importance of neutrinos in the
dynamics and nucleosynthesis in these environments, it is desirable to
ascertain whether an Earth-based detection could contain signatures of bipolar
oscillations that occurred within a supernova envelope. To that end, we
continue examining a cost-function formulation of statistical data assimilation
(SDA) to infer solutions to a small-scale model of neutrino flavor
transformation. SDA is an inference paradigm designed to optimize a model with
sparse data. Our model consists of two mono-energetic neutrino beams with
different energies emanating from a source and coherently interacting with each
other and with a matter background, with time-varying interaction strengths. We
attempt to infer flavor transformation histories of these beams using simulated
measurements of the flavor content at locations in vacuum (that is, far from
the source), which could in principle correspond to earth-based detectors.
Within the scope of this small-scale model, we found that: (i) based on such
measurements, the SDA procedure is able to infer \textit{whether} bipolar
oscillations had occurred within the protoneutron star envelope, and (ii) if
the measurements are able to sample the full amplitude of the neutrino
oscillations in vacuum, then the amplitude of the prior bipolar oscillations is
also well predicted. This result intimates that the inference paradigm can well
complement numerical integration codes, via its ability to infer flavor
evolution at physically inaccessible locations.

measurements. Inferring the posterior of hidden features, conditioned on the
observed measurements, is essential for understanding the uncertainty of
results and downstream scientific interpretations. Traditional approaches for
posterior estimation include sampling-based methods and variational inference.
However, sampling-based methods are typically slow for high-dimensional inverse
problems, while variational inference often lacks estimation accuracy. In this
paper, we propose alpha-DPI, a deep learning framework that first learns an
approximate posterior using alpha-divergence variational inference paired with
a generative neural network, and then produces more accurate posterior samples
through importance re-weighting of the network samples. It inherits strengths
from both sampling and variational inference methods: it is fast, accurate, and
scalable to high-dimensional problems. We apply our approach to two high-impact
astronomical inference problems using real data: exoplanet astrometry and black
hole feature extraction.

Title:Evidence that the Hot Jupiter WASP-77 A b Formed Beyond Its Parent Protoplanetary Disk's H2O Ice Line,"
Abstract:  Idealized protoplanetary disk and giant planet formation models have been
interpreted to suggest that a giant planet's atmospheric abundances can be used
to infer its formation location in its parent protoplanetary disk. It has
recently been reported that the hot Jupiter WASP-77 A b has sub-solar
atmospheric carbon and oxygen abundances with a solar C/O abundance ratio.
Assuming solar carbon and oxygen abundances for its host star WASP-77 A,
WASP-77 A b's atmospheric carbon and oxygen abundances possibly indicate that
it accreted its envelope interior to its parent protoplanetary disk's H2O ice
line from carbon-depleted gas with little subsequent planetesimal accretion or
core erosion. We comprehensively model WASP-77 A and use our results to better
characterize WASP-77 A b. We show that the photospheric abundances of carbon
and oxygen in WASP-77 A are super-solar with a sub-solar C/O abundance ratio,
implying that WASP-77 A b's atmosphere has significantly sub-stellar carbon and
oxygen abundances with a super-stellar C/O ratio. Our result possibly indicates
that WASP-77 A b's envelope was accreted by the planet beyond its parent
protoplanetary disk's H2O ice line. While numerous theoretical complications to
these idealized models have now been identified, the possibility of non-solar
protoplanetary disk abundance ratios confound even the most sophisticated
protoplanetary disk and giant planet formation models. We therefore argue that
giant planet atmospheric abundance ratios can only be meaningfully interpreted
relative to the possibly non-solar mean compositions of their parent
protoplanetary disks as recorded in the photospheric abundances of their
solar-type dwarf host stars.

Title:H$_2$-dominated Atmosphere as an Indicator of Second-generation Rocky White Dwarf Exoplanets,"
Abstract:  Following the discovery of the first exoplanet candidate transiting a white
dwarf (WD), a ""white dwarf opportunity"" for characterizing the atmospheres of
terrestrial exoplanets around WDs is emerging. Large planet-to-star size ratios
and hence large transit depths make transiting WD exoplanets favorable targets
for transmission spectroscopy - conclusive detection of spectral features on an
Earth-like planet transiting a close-by WD can be achieved within a medium
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) program. Despite the apparently promising
opportunity, however, the post-main sequence (MS) evolutionary history of a
first-generation WD exoplanet has never been incorporated in atmospheric
modeling. Furthermore, second-generation planets formed in WD debris disks have
never been studied from a photochemical perspective. We demonstrate that
transmission spectroscopy can identify a second-generation rocky WD exoplanet
with a thick ($\sim1$ bar) H$_2$-dominated atmosphere. In addition, we can
infer outgassing activities of a WD exoplanet based on its transmission spectra
and test photochemical runaway by studying CH$_4$ buildup.

Title:Accretion Disk Size Measurements of Active Galactic Nuclei Monitored by the Zwicky Transient Facility,"
Abstract:  We compile a sample of 92 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z<0.75 with $gri$
photometric light curves from the archival data of the Zwicky Transient
Facility and measure the accretion disk sizes via continuum reverberation
mapping. We employ Monte Carlo simulation tests to assess the influences of
data sampling and broad emission lines and select out the sample with
adequately high sampling cadences (3 days apart in average) and minimum
contaminations of broad emission lines. The inter-band time delays of
individual AGNs are calculated using the interpolated cross-correlation
function and then these delays are fitted with a generalized accretion disk
model, in which inter-band time delays are a power function of wavelength,
black hole mass, and luminosity. A Markov-chain Monte Carlo method is adopted
to determine the best parameter values. Overall the inter-band time delays can
be fitted with the $\tau \ \propto \lambda^{4/3}$ relation as predicted from a
steady-state, optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk, however, the
yielded disk size is systematically larger than expected, although the ratio of
the measured to theoretical disk sizes depend on using the emissivity -- or
responsivity -- weighted disk radius. These results are broadly consistent with
previous studies, all together raising a puzzle about the ""standard"" accretion
disk model.

"Title:Discovery of a cool, metal-rich gas reservoir in the outskirts of z ~ 0.5 clusters","
Abstract:  We built the first-ever statistically significant sample of ~ 80,000
background quasar - foreground cluster pairs to study the cool, metal-rich gas
in the outskirts (> R500) of z ~ 0.5 clusters with a median mass of ~ 10^14.2
M_sun. The sample was obtained by cross-matching the SDSS cluster catalog of
Wen & Han (2015) and SDSS quasar catalog of Lyke et al. (2020). The median
impact parameter (rho_cl) of the clusters from the quasar sightlines is 2.4 Mpc
(median rho_cl/R500 = 3.6). A strong MgII, along with marginal FeII, absorption
is detected in the mean and median stacked spectra of the quasars with total
MgII rest-frame equivalent width (W^(2796+2803)) of 0.034 pm 0.005 A (7simga)
and 0.010 pm 0.003 A (3sigma), respectively. The W^(2796+2803) shows a
declining trend with increasing rho_cl and rho_cl/R500, but does not show any
significant trend with mass (M500) or redshift (zcl) within the small M500 and
zcl ranges probed here. The MgII absorption signal and the trends persist even
if we exclude the quasar-cluster pairs where the background quasars may be
probing the circum-galactic medium (CGM) of bright galaxies with impact
parameters < 300 kpc. The MgII (and FeII) absorption reported here is the first
detection of its kind. It indicates the presence of a cool, metal-rich gas
reservoir surrounding galaxy clusters out to several R500. We suggest that the
metal-rich gas in the cluster outskirts arise from stripped materials and that
gas stripping may be important out to large clustocentric distances (> 3R500 ).

Title:The Origin of the Relation Between Stellar Angular Momentum and Stellar Mass in Nearby Disk-dominated galaxies,"
Abstract:  The IllustrisTNG simulations reproduce the observed scaling relation between
stellar specific angular momentum (sAM) $j_{\rm s}$ and mass $M_{\rm s}$ of
central galaxies. We show that the local $j_{\rm s}$-$M_{\rm s}$ relation ${\rm
log}\ j_{\rm s} = 0.55 \ {\rm log}\ M_{\rm s} + 2.77$ develops at $z\lesssim 1$
in disk-dominated galaxies. We provide a simple model that describes well such
a connection between halos and galaxies. The index 0.55 of the $j_{\rm
s}$-$M_{\rm s}$ relation comes from the product of the indices of the $j_{\rm
tot}\propto M_{\rm tot}^{0.81}$, $M_{\rm tot}\propto M_{\rm s}^{0.67}$, and
$j_{\rm s}\propto j_{\rm tot}$ relations, where $j_{\rm tot}$ and $M_{\rm tot}$
are overall sAM and mass of a halo. A non-negligible deviation from the tidal
torque theory, which predicts $j_{\rm tot}\propto M_{\rm tot}^{2/3}$, should be
included. This model further suggests that the stellar-to-halo mass ratio of
disk galaxies increases monotonically following a nearly power-law function
that is consistent with the latest dynamical measurements. Biased collapse, in
which galaxies form from the inner and lower sAM portion of their parent halos,
has a minor effect at low redshifts. The retention factor of angular momentum
reaches $\sim 1$ in disk galaxies with strong rotations, and it correlates
inversely with the mass fraction of the spheroidal component, which partially
explains the morphological dependence of the $j_{\rm s}$-$M_{\rm s}$ relation.

Title:Evolution of Accretion Modes between Spectral States Inferred from Spectral and Timing Analysis of Cygnus X-1 with Insight-HXMT observations,"
Abstract:  We execute a detailed spectral-timing study of Cygnus X-1 in the low/hard,
intermediate and high/soft states with the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope
observations. The broad band energy spectra fit well with the ""truncated disk
model"" with the inner boundary of the accretion disk stays within $\sim$10
\textit R$_{\rm g}$ and moves inward as the source softens. Through studying of
PDS, rms and Fourier-frequency component resolved spectroscopy, we find that
the X-ray variations are generated in two different regions for each state. We
discover that the major role that contributes to the X-ray variation is the hot
corona rather than the accretion disk. We suggest a scenario with different
corona geometry for each state based on the truncated disk geometry in which
the corona wraps up the disk to form a sandwich geometry in the low/hard state,
and then gradually moves away from the disk in direction that is perpendicular
to the disk until forming a jet-like geometry in the high/soft state.

Abstract:  During the last 20 years, TeV astronomy turned from a fledgling field, with
only a handful of sources into a fully-developed astronomy discipline,
broadening our knowledge on a variety of types of TeV gamma-ray sources. This
progress has been mainly achieved due to currently operating instruments:
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, Surface Array and Water Cherenkov

with a considerable leap of performance parameters. This review summarises the
current status of the TeV astronomy instrumentation, mainly focusing on the
comparison of the different types of instruments and analysis challenges, as
well as provides an outlook into the future installations. The capabilities and
limitations of different techniques of observations of TeV gamma rays are

Title:Oldhamite: A hidden key mineral for C-O-S-Ca cycles in Earth,"
Abstract:  Oldhamite (CaS) is a rare mineral, which is only observed naturally in
enstatite this http URL occurrence of CaS has been documented from other groups
of meteorites and terrestrial samples. However, in experiments at 1.5 GPa/1510
K and 0.5 GPa/1320 K, when the lgfo2 is lower than -10.57 (FMQ-0.52), CaS was
produced in this study by a two-melt mechanism involving the reaction between
molten pyrrhotite-pentlandite-bearing orthopyroxenite and molten CaCO3. CaS can
be easily oxidized to form CaSO4 or hydrolyzed to produce calcium hydroxide,
which may explain why it has never been found in geological samples from Earth.
We speculate that part of the anhydrite and gypsum in black smokers along
mid-ocean ridges are related to the oxidation or hydrolysis of CaS in the
underlying mantle. CaS can be produced when the Siberian mantle plume intruded
into the lithosphere.

Title:Survey of multiple populations in globular clusters among very low-mass stars,"
Abstract:  Recent work has shown that NIR Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry allows
us to disentangle multiple populations (MPs) among M dwarfs of globular
clusters (GCs) and investigate this phenomenon in very low-mass (VLM) stars.
Here, we present the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of nine GCs and the open
cluster NGC 6791 in the F110W and F160W bands of HST, showing that the main
sequences (MSs) below the knee are either broadened or split thus providing
evidence of MPs among VLM stars. In contrast, the MS of NGC 6791 is consistent
with a single population. The color distribution of M-dwarfs dramatically
changes between different GCs and the color width correlates with the cluster
mass. We conclude that the MP ubiquity, variety, and dependence on GC mass are
properties common to VLM and more-massive stars. We combined UV, optical, and
NIR observations of NGC 2808 and NGC 6121 (M 4) to identify MPs along with a
wide range of stellar masses (~ 0.2 - 0.8M ), from the MS turn off to the VLM
regime, and measured, for the first time, their mass functions (MFs). We find
that the fraction of MPs does not depend on the stellar mass and that their MFs
have similar slopes. These findings indicate that the properties of MPs do not
depend on stellar mass. In a scenario where the second generations formed in
higher-density environments than the first generations, the possibility that
the MPs formed with the same initial MF would suggest that it does not depend
on the environment.

Title:The nonlinear field equation of the three-point correlation function of galaxies,"
Abstract:  Based on the field theory of density fluctuation under Newtonian gravity, we
obtain analytically the nonlinear equation of 3-pt correlation function $\zeta$
of galaxies in a homogeneous, isotropic, static universe. The density
fluctuations have been kept up to second order. By the Fry-Peebles ansatz and
the Groth-Peebles ansatz, the equation of $\zeta$ becomes closed and differs
from the Gaussian approximate equation. Using the boundary condition inferred
from the data of SDSS, we obtain the solution $\zeta(r, u, \theta)$ at fixed
$u=2$, which exhibits a shallow $U$-shape along the angle $\theta$ and,
nevertheless, decreases monotonously along the radial $r$. We show its
difference with the Gaussian solution. As a direct criterion of
non-Gaussianity, the reduced $Q(r, u, \theta)$ deviates from the Gaussianity
plane $Q=1$, exhibits a deeper $U$-shape along $\theta$ and varies weakly along
$r$, agreeing with the observed data.

Title:Grids of stellar models with rotation VII: Models from 0.8 to 300 M$_\odot$ at super-solar metallicity (Z = 0.020),"
Abstract:  We present a grid of stellar models at super-solar metallicity (Z = 0.020)
extending the previous grids of Geneva models at solar and sub-solar
metallicities. A metallicity of Z = 0.020 was chosen to match that of the inner
Galactic disk. A modest increase of 43% (=0.02/0.014) in metallicity compared
to solar models means that the models evolve similarly to solar models but with
slightly larger mass loss. Mass loss limits the final total masses of the
super-solar models to 35 M$_\odot$ even for stars with initial masses much
larger than 100 M$_\odot$. Mass loss is strong enough in stars above 20
M$_\odot$ for rotating stars (25 M$_\odot$ for non-rotating stars) to remove
the entire hydrogen-rich envelope. Our models thus predict SNII below 20
M$_\odot$ for rotating stars (25 M$_\odot$ for non-rotating stars) and SNIb
(possibly SNIc) above that. We computed both isochrones and synthetic clusters
to compare our super-solar models to the Westerlund 1 (Wd1) massive young
cluster. A synthetic cluster combining rotating and non-rotating models with an
age spread between log10 (age/yr) = 6.7 and 7.0 is able to reproduce
qualitatively the observed populations of WR, RSG and YSG stars in Wd1, in
particular their simultaneous presence at log10(L/L$_\odot$) = 5-5.5. The
quantitative agreement is imperfect and we discuss the likely causes: synthetic
cluster parameters, binary interactions, mass loss and their related
uncertainties. In particular, mass loss in the cool part of the HRD plays a key
role.

Title:Eccentricity evolution of massive black hole binaries from formation to coalescence,"
Abstract:  Coalescing supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs) are expected to be the
loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the Universe. Detection rates
for ground or space-based detectors based on cosmological simulations and
semi-analytic models are highly uncertain. A major difficulty stems from the
necessity to model the BHB from the scale of the merger to that of inspiral. Of
particular relevance to the GW merger timescale is the binary eccentricity.
Here we present a self-consistent numerical study of the eccentricity of BHBs
formed in massive gas-free mergers from the early stages of the merger to the
hardening phase, followed by a semi-analytical model down to coalescence. We
find that the early eccentricity of the unbound black hole pair is largely
determined by the initial orbit. It systematically decreases during the
dynamical friction phase. The eccentricity at binary formation is affected by
stochasticity and noise owing to encounters with stars, but preserves a strong
correlation with the initial orbital eccentricity. Binding of the black holes
is a phase characterised by strong perturbations, and we present a quantitative
definition of the time of binary formation. During hardening the eccentricity
increases in minor mergers, unless the binary is approximately circular, but
remains largely unchanged in major mergers, in agreement with predictions from
semi-analytical models based on isotropic scattering experiments. Coalescence
times due to hardening and GW emission in gas-poor non-rotating ellipticals are
<~0.5 Gyr for the large initial eccentricities (0.5 < e < 0.9) typical of
galaxy mergers in cosmological simulations.

Title:Automatic algorithm to obtain $v \sin i$ values via Fourier Transform in BeSOS database,"
Abstract:  Be stars are found to rotate close to their critical rotation and therefore
they are considered as an important laboratory of study for stellar rotation.
In this context, we obtain the projected rotational velocity of a sample of
classical Be Southern stars in the BeSOS database via Fourier Transform in an
automated way for several absorption lines at different epochs. A Gaussian
profile is fitted to eight observed photospheric HeI lines in order to select
automatically the spectral signal given by areas under the curve of 95.45%,
98.75% and 99.83% from the profile to obtain $v \sin i$ via Fourier Transform
technique. The values obtained are in global agreement with the literature.
Analysing only one line is not enough to set the $v \sin i$ value, depending on
the line the value in most cases are underestimated with respect to
$\lambda$4471. When gravity darkening effects are including, apparent values
increases by $\sim10$%. The resolution of the instrument PUCHEROS used for
BeSOS spectra ($R \sim 17\,000$) constrain a theoretical lower bound possible
at $v \sin i \sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$. The procedure has limitations using a
linear limb-darkening function with $\varepsilon = 0.6$ for classical Be stars
rotating close to the break-up velocity without gravity-darkening corrections,
which can't be negligible. Previous works measure $v \ sin i$ values using just
one spectral line and here we demonstrate that with more lines the results can
varies. This could be due to the photospheric distribution of atomic
transitions on classical Be stars.

Title:The composition of massive white dwarfs and their dependence on the C-burning modeling,"
Abstract:  Recent computations of the interior composition of ultra-massive white dwarfs
(WD) have suggested that some white dwarfs could be composed of neon
(Ne)-dominated cores. This result is at variance with our previous
understanding of the chemical structure of massive white dwarfs, where oxygen
is the predominant element. In addition, it is not clear whether some hybrid
carbon (C) oxygen (O)-Ne white dwarfs might form when convective boundary
mixing is accounted for during the propagation of the C-flame, in the C-burning
stage. Both Ne-dominated and hybrid CO-Ne core would have measurable
consequences for asteroseismological studies based on evolutionary models. In
this work we explore in detail to which extent differences in the adopted
micro- and macro-physics can explain the different final white dwarf
compositions that have been found by different authors. Additionally, we
explored the impact of such differences in the cooling times, crystallization
and pulsational properties of pulsating WDs. We explore the impact of the
intensity of convective boundary mixing during the C-flash, extreme mass-loss
rates, and the size of the adopted nuclear networks on the final composition,
age, crystallization and pulsational properties of white dwarfs. Based on the
insight coming from 3D hydro-dynamical simulations, we expect that the very
slow propagation of the carbon flame will be altered by turbulent entrainment
affecting the inward propagation of the flame. Also, we find that Ne-dominated
chemical profiles of massive WDs recently reported appear in their modeling due
to the overlooking of a key nuclear reaction. We find that the inaccuracies in
the chemical composition of ultra-massive white dwarfs recently reported lead
to differences of 10% in the cooling times and degree of crystallization and
about 8% in the period spacing of the models once they reach the ZZ Ceti
instability strip.

Title:The halo of M105 and its group environment as traced by planetary nebula populations: II. Using kinematics of single stars to unveil the presence of intragroup light around the Leo I galaxies NGC 3384 and M105,"
Abstract:  M105 is an early-type galaxy in the nearby Leo I group, the closest galaxy
group to contain all galaxy types and therefore an excellent environment to
explore the low-mass end of intra-group light (IGL) assembly. We present a new
extended kinematic survey of planetary nebulae (PNe) in M105 and the
surrounding 30'x30' in the Leo I group with the Planetary Nebula Spectrograph.
We use PNe as kinematic tracers of the diffuse stellar light in the halo and
IGL and employ Gaussian mixture models to separate contributions from the
companion galaxy NGC 3384 and associate PNe with halo and IGL components around
M105. We present a catalogue of 314 PNe and firmly associate 93 with NGC 3384
and 169 with M105. The PNe in M105 are further associated with its halo and the
surrounding exponential envelope. We construct smooth velocity and velocity
dispersion fields and calculate projected rotation, velocity dispersion, and
$\lambda_R$ profiles for each component. Halo PNe exhibit declining velocity
dispersion and rotation profiles, while the velocity dispersion and rotation of
the exponential envelope increase notably at large radii. We identify three
regimes with distinct kinematics that are linked to distinct stellar population
properties: (i) the rotating core (within $1~R_\mathrm{eff}$) formed in situ
and dominated by metal-rich ([M/H]~0) stars likely formed in situ, (ii) the
halo from 1 to $7.5~R_\mathrm{eff}$ consisting of intermediate-metallicity
stars ([M/H]>-1), either formed in situ or brought in through major mergers,
and (iii) the exponential envelope reaching beyond our farthest data point at
16 $R_\mathrm{eff}$, predominately composed of metal-poor ([M/H]<-1) stars. The
high velocity dispersion and moderate rotation of the latter are consistent
with that measured for dwarf satellite galaxies in the Leo I group, indicating
that the exponential envelope traces the transition to the IGL.

Abstract:  The carbon footprint of astronomical research is an increasingly topical
issue with first estimates of research institute and national community
footprints having recently been published. As these assessments have typically
excluded the contribution of astronomical research infrastructures, we
complement these studies by providing an estimate of the contribution of
astronomical space missions and ground-based observatories using greenhouse gas
emission factors that relates cost and payload mass to carbon footprint. We
find that worldwide active astronomical research infrastructures currently have
a carbon footprint of 20.3$\pm$3.3 MtCO$_2$ equivalent (CO$_2$e) and an annual
emission of 1,169$\pm$249 ktCO$_2$e yr$^{-1}$ corresponding to a footprint of
36.6$\pm$14.0 tCO$_2$e per year per astronomer. Compared with contributions
from other aspects of astronomy research activity, our results suggest that
research infrastructures make the single largest contribution to the carbon
footprint of an astronomer. We discuss the limitations and uncertainties of our
method and explore measures that can bring greenhouse gas emissions from
astronomical research infrastructures towards a sustainable level.

Abstract:  The advancement in the field of data science especially in machine learning
along with vast databases of variable star projects like the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) encourages researchers to analyse as
well as classify light curves of different variable stars automatically with
efficiency. In the present work, we have demonstrated the relative performances
of principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA)
applying to huge databases of OGLE variable star light curves after obtaining
1000 magnitudes between phase 0 to 1 with step length 0.001 for each light
curves in identifying resonances for fundamental mode (FU) and first overtone
(FO) Cepheids and in the classification of variable stars for Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) as well as Milky Way (MW). We have
seen that the performance of ICA is better for finding resonances for Cepheid
variables as well as for accurately classifying large data sets of light curves
than PCA. Using K-means clustering algorithm (CA) with respect to independent
components (ICs), we have plotted period-luminosity diagrams and
colour-magnitude diagrams separately for LMC, SMC and MW and found that ICA
along with K-means CA is a very robust tool for classification as well as
future prediction on the nature of light curves of variable stars.

Title:The role of the cosmic web in the scatter of the galaxy stellar mass - gas metallicity relation,"
Abstract:  Understanding the relationship between the cosmic web and the gas content of
galaxies is a key step towards understanding galaxy evolution. However, the
impact of the cosmic web on the growth of galaxies and dark matter halos is not
yet properly understood. We report a detection of the effect of the cosmic web
on the galaxy stellar mass - gas phase metallicity relation of low redshift
star-forming galaxies, using SDSS data. The proximity of a galaxy to a node,
independently of stellar mass and overdensity, influences its gas-phase
metallicity, with galaxies closer to nodes displaying higher chemical
enrichment than those further away. We find a similar but significantly weaker
effect with respect to filaments. We supplement our observational analysis with
a study of the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG (TNG300),
finding qualitative agreement with our results. Using IllustrisTNG, our results
can be explained by both halo assembly bias and gas supply combining in nodes
in a way that significantly modulates the metallicity of the gas, contributing
to the scatter of this fundamental relation in galaxy evolution.

Title:Detection of iron emission lines and a temperature inversion on the dayside of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-20b,"
Abstract:  Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are gas giants with very high equilibrium
temperatures. In recent years, multiple chemical species, including various
atoms and ions, have been discovered in their atmospheres. Most of these
observations have been performed with transmission spectroscopy, although UHJs
are also ideal targets for emission spectroscopy due to their strong thermal
radiation. We present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the
transiting UHJ KELT-20b/MASCARA-2b. The observation was performed with the
CARMENES spectrograph at orbital phases before and after the secondary eclipse.
We detected atomic Fe using the cross-correlation technique. The detected Fe
lines are in emission, which unambiguously indicates a temperature inversion on
the dayside hemisphere. We furthermore retrieved the temperature structure with
the detected Fe lines. The result shows that the atmosphere has a strong
temperature inversion with a temperature of $4900\pm{700}$ K and a pressure of
$10^{-4.8_{-1.1}^{+1.0}}$ bar at the upper layer of the inversion. A joint
retrieval of the CARMENES data and the TESS secondary eclipse data returns a
temperature of $2550_{-250}^{+150}$ K and a pressure of
$10^{-1.5_{-0.6}^{+0.7}}$ bar at the lower layer of the temperature inversion.
The detection of such a strong temperature inversion is consistent with
theoretical simulations that predict an inversion layer on the dayside of UHJs.
The joint retrieval of the CARMENES and TESS data demonstrates the power of
combing high-resolution emission spectroscopy with secondary eclipse photometry
in characterizing atmospheric temperature structures.

Abstract:  Young massive stars play an important role in the evolution of the
interstellar medium (ISM) and the self-regulation of star formation in giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) by injecting energy, momentum, and radiation (stellar
feedback) into surrounding environments, disrupting the parental clouds, and
regulating further star formation. Information of the stellar feedback inheres
in the emission we observe, however inferring the physical properties from
photometric and spectroscopic measurements is difficult, because stellar
feedback is a highly complex and non-linear process, so that the observational
data are highly degenerate. On this account, we introduce a novel method that
couples a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) with the
WARPFIELD-emission predictor (WARPFIELD-EMP) to estimate the physical
properties of star-forming regions from spectral observations. We present a
cINN that predicts the posterior distribution of seven physical parameters
(cloud mass, star formation efficiency, cloud density, cloud age which means
age of the first generation stars, age of the youngest cluster, the number of
clusters, and the evolutionary phase of the cloud) from the luminosity of 12
optical emission lines, and test our network with synthetic models that are not
used during training. Our network is a powerful and time-efficient tool that
can accurately predict each parameter, although degeneracy sometimes remains in
the posterior estimates of the number of clusters. We validate the posteriors
estimated by the network and confirm that they are consistent with the input
observations. We also evaluate the influence of observational uncertainties on
the network performance.

Title:How the super-Eddington regime regulates black hole growth in high-redshift galaxies,"
Abstract:  Super-Eddington accretion is one scenario that may explain the rapid assembly
of $\sim 10^9\rm\, M_\odot$ supermassive black holes (BHs) within the first
billion year of the Universe. This critical regime is associated with
radiatively inefficient accretion and accompanied by powerful outflows in the
form of winds and jets. By means of hydrodynamical simulations of BH evolution
in an isolated galaxy and its host halo with 12 pc resolution, we investigate
how super-Eddington feedback affects the mass growth of the BH. It is shown
that super-Eddington feedback efficiently prevents BH growth within a few Myr.
The super-Eddington accretion events remain relatively mild with typical rates
of about 2-3 times the Eddington limit, because of the efficient regulation by
jets in that regime. We find that these jets are powerful enough to eject gas
from the centre of the host galaxy all the way up to galactic scales at a few
kpc, but do not significantly impact gas inflows at those large scales. By
varying the jet feedback efficiency, we find that weaker super-Eddington jets
allow for more significant BH growth through more frequent episodes of
super-Eddington accretion. We conclude that effective super-Eddington growth is
possible, as we find that simulations with weak jet feedback efficiencies
provide a slightly larger BH mass evolution over long periods of time ($\sim
80\,\rm Myr$) than that for a BH accreting at the Eddington limit.

Title:UOCS VII. Blue Straggler Populations of Open Cluster NGC 7789 with UVIT/AstroSat,"
Abstract:  NGC 7789 is a $\sim$1.6 Gyr old, populous open cluster located at $\sim$2000
pc. We characterize the blue straggler stars (BSS) of this cluster using the
Ultraviolet (UV) data from the UVIT/AstroSat. We present spectral energy
distributions (SED) of 15 BSS candidates constructed using multi-wavelength
data ranging from UV to IR wavelengths. In 8 BSS candidates, a single
temperature SED is found to be satisfactory. We discover hot companions in 5
BSS candidates. The hot companions with Teff $\sim$11750-15500 K, R
$\sim$0.069-0.242 R$_{\odot}$, and L $\sim$0.25-1.55 L$_{\odot}$, are most
likely extremely low mass (ELM) white dwarfs (WDs) with masses smaller than
$\sim$0.18 M$_{\odot}$, and thereby confirmed post mass transfer systems. We
discuss the implication of this finding in the context of BSS formation
mechanisms. Two additional BSS show excess in one or more UV filters, and may
have a hot companion, however, we are unable to characterize them. We suggest
that at least 5 of the 15 BSS candidates (33%) studied in this cluster have
formed via the mass transfer mechanism.

Title:Deep upper limit on the optical emission during a hard X-ray burst from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154,"
Abstract:  In September 2021 the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered a stage of
burst/flaring activity in the hard X-ray band. On September 10, 2021 we
observed SGR J1935+2154 with the fiber-fed fast optical photon counter
IFI+Iqueye, mounted at the 1.22 m Galileo telescope in Asiago. During one of
the IFI+Iqueye observing windows a hard X-ray burst was detected with the Fermi
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. We performed a search for any significant increase in
the count rate on the 1-s, 10-ms and 1-ms binned IFI+Iqueye light curves around
the time of the Fermi burst. No significant peak was detected with a
significance above 3$\sigma$ in an interval of $\pm$90 s around the burst.
Correcting for interstellar extinction ($A_V \simeq 5.8$ mag), the IFI+Iqueye
upper limits to any possible optical burst from SGR J1935+2154 are $V=10.1$
mag, $V=7.2$ mag and $V=5.8$ mag for the 1-s, 10-ms and 1-ms binned light
curves, respectively. The corresponding extinction corrected upper limits to
the fluence (specific fluence) are $3.1 \times 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (0.35 Jy
s), $4.2 \times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (4.8 Jy $\cdot$ 10 ms), and $1.6 \times
10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (17.9 Jy ms), orders of magnitude deeper than any
previous simultaneous optical limit on a magnetar burst. The IFI+Iqueye
measurement can also place a more stringent constraint to the spectral index of
the optical to hard X-ray fluence of SGR J1935+2154, implying a spectrum
steeper than $\nu^{0.64}$. Fast optical timing observations of bursts
associated with radio emission have then the potential to yield a detection.

Title:Probing Anisotropies of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background with LISA,"
Abstract:  We investigate the sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA) to the anisotropies of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background
(SGWB). We first discuss the main astrophysical and cosmological sources of
SGWB which are characterized by anisotropies in the GW energy density, and we
build a Signal-to-Noise estimator to quantify the sensitivity of LISA to
different multipoles. We then perform a Fisher matrix analysis of the prospects
of detectability of anisotropic features with LISA for individual multipoles,
focusing on a SGWB with a power-law frequency profile. We compute the noise
angular spectrum taking into account the specific scan strategy of the LISA
detector. We analyze the case of the kinematic dipole and quadrupole generated
by Doppler boosting an isotropic SGWB. We find that $\beta\, \Omega_{\rm
GW}\sim 2\times 10^{-11}$ is required to observe a dipolar signal with LISA.
The detector response to the quadrupole has a factor $\sim 10^3 \,\beta$
relative to that of the dipole. The characterization of the anisotropies, both
from a theoretical perspective and from a map-making point of view, allows us
to extract information that can be used to understand the origin of the SGWB,
and to discriminate among distinct superimposed SGWB sources.

Title:The Properties and Evolutions of Starspots on Three Detached Eclipsing Binaries in the LAMOST-Kepler survey,"
Abstract:  The spotted detached eclipsing binary (DEB) offers insights into starspots on
the binary. Three spotted DEBs, KIC 8097825, KIC 6859813, and KIC 5527172,
which were observed by the Kepler photometry and LAMOST spectroscopy, are
studied in this work. The physical parameters of binaries are determined by
binary modeling. The sizes, lifetimes, and single/double-dip ratio (SDR) of
starspots are derived by starspot analysis. KIC 8097825 has large starspots.
KIC 6859813 has a spot rotation period shorter than its orbital period but the
system should be synchronized inferred from timescale estimation. The
difference may be the result of the surface differential rotation. The KIC
5527172 has a long spot lifetime and an M dwarf component with an inflation
radius. The primaries of these binaries and the secondary of KIC 8097825 have
spots. Adding spotted DEBs of literature, we compare the starspots on binaries
with those on the single stars. The spot sizes of starspots on 65% binaries are
smaller than the median of those on single stars. The lifetimes of starspots on
binaries are consistent with those on single stars when the rotation periods
are larger than 3 days. SDRs for half of the binaries are consistent with those
of single star systems, while another half are smaller. The relative lifetime
positively correlates with the RMS and SDR but negatively correlates with the
rotation period. These relations are similar to those of spots on the single
star systems. Binaries with luminosity ratios close to the unit tend to have
more double dips.

Title:Effects of UV stellar spectral uncertainty on the chemistry of terrestrial atmospheres,"
Abstract:  The upcoming deployment of JWST will dramatically advance our ability to
characterize exoplanet atmospheres, both in terms of precision and sensitivity
to smaller and cooler planets. Disequilibrium chemical processes dominate these
cooler atmospheres, requiring accurate photochemical modeling of such
environments. The host star's UV spectrum is a critical input to these models,
but most exoplanet hosts lack UV observations. For cases in which the host UV
spectrum is unavailable, a reconstructed or proxy spectrum will need to be used
in its place. In this study, we use the MUSCLES catalog and UV line scaling
relations to understand how well reconstructed host star spectra reproduce
photochemically modeled atmospheres using real UV observations. We focus on two
cases; a modern Earth-like atmosphere and an Archean Earth-like atmosphere that
forms copious hydrocarbon hazes. We find that modern Earth-like environments
are well-reproduced with UV reconstructions, whereas hazy (Archean Earth)
atmospheres suffer from changes at the observable level. Specifically, both the
stellar UV emission lines and the UV continuum significantly influence the
chemical state and haze production in our modeled Archean atmospheres,
resulting in observable differences in their transmission spectra. Our modeling
results indicate that UV observations of individual exoplanet host stars are
needed to accurately characterize and predict the transmission spectra of hazy
terrestrial atmospheres. In the absence of UV data, reconstructed spectra that
account for both UV emission lines and continuum are the next best option,
albeit at the cost of modeling accuracy.

Title:Rapid-then-slow migration reproduces mass distribution of TRAPPIST-1 system,"
Abstract:  The TRAPPIST-1 system is an iconic planetary system in various aspects (e.g.,
habitability, resonant relation, and multiplicity) and hence has attracted
considerable attention. The mass distribution of the TRAPPIST-1 planets is
characterized by two features: the two inner planets are large, and the masses
of the four planets in the outer orbit increase with orbital distance. The
origin of these features cannot be explained by previous formation models. We
investigate whether the mass distribution of the TRAPPIST-1 system can be
reproduced by a planet formation model using N-body simulations. We used a gas
disk evolution model around a low-mass star constructed by considering disk
winds and followed the growth and orbital migration from planetary embryos with
the isolation mass, which increases with orbital distance. As a result, we find
that from the initial phase, planets in inner orbits undergo rapid orbital
migration, and the coalescence growth near the inner disk edge is enhanced.
This allows the inner planets to grow larger. Meanwhile, compared with the
inner planets, planets in outer orbits migrate more slowly and do not
frequently collide with neighboring planets. Therefore, the trend of increasing
mass toward the outer orbit, called reversed mass ranking, is maintained. The
final mass distribution approximately agrees with the two features of the mass
distribution in the TRAPPIST-1 system. We discover that the mass distribution
in the TRAPPIST-1 system can be reproduced when embryos experience rapid
migration and become trapped near the disk inner edge, and then more massive
embryos undergo slower migration. This migration transition can be achieved
naturally in a disk evolution model with disk winds.

field-space geometry, we derive bounds on parameter space by demanding viable
late-time acceleration and the absence of gradient instabilities, as well as

Title:The large-scale structure from non-Gaussian primordial perturbations,"
Abstract:  The late-time effect of primordial non-Gaussianity offers a window into the
physics of inflation and the very early Universe. In this work we study the
consequences of a particular class of primordial non-Gaussianity that is fully
characterized by initial density fluctuations drawn from a non-Gaussian
probability density function, rather than by construction of a particular form
for the primordial bispectrum. We numerically generate multiple realisations of
cosmological structure and use the late-time matter power spectrum, bispectrum
and trispectrum to determine the effect of these modified initial conditions.
We show that the initial non-Gaussianity has only a small imprint on the first
three polyspectra, when compared to a standard Gaussian cosmology. Furthermore,
some of our models present an interesting scale-dependent deviation from the
Gaussian case in the bispectrum and trispectrum, although the signal is at most
at the percent level. The majority of our models are consistent with CMB
constraints on the trispectrum, while the others are only marginally excluded.
Finally, we discuss further possible extensions of our study.

Title:The Dark Ages' 21-cm Trispectrum,"
Abstract:  We investigate tomography of 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuations during
the Dark Ages as a probe for constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. We expand
the 21- cm brightness temperature up to cubic order in perturbation theory and
improve previous models of the signal by including the effect of the free
electron fraction. Using modified standard perturbation theory methods that
include baryonic pressure effects we derive an improved secondary bispectrum
and for the first time derive the secondary trispectrum of 21-cm brightness
temperature fluctuations. We then forecast the amount of information available
from the Dark Ages to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity, including the
imprints of massive particle exchange during inflation and we determine how
much signal is lost due to secondary non-Gaussianity. We find that although
secondary non-Gaussianity swamps the primordial signal, primordial
non-Gaussianity can still be extracted with signal-to-noise ratios that surpass
current and future CMB experiments by several orders of magnitude, depending on
the experimental setup. Furthermore, we conclude that for the bi- and
trispectra of massive particle exchange marginalizing over other primordial
shapes affects signal-to-noise ratios more severely than secondary shapes.
Baryonic pressure effects turn out to have a negligible impact on our
forecasts, even at scales close to the Jeans scale. The results of this work
reinforce the prospects of 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuations from the
Dark Ages as the ultimate probe for primordial non-Gaussianity.

Abstract:  We calculate the Bayesian evidences for a class of Ekpyrotic universe models,

Combining parsimony and observational constraints, this gives us a systematic
way to evaluate the degree to which Ekpyrotic models are constrained by CMB
data from Planck. We integrate the equations of motion numerically to define a
likelihood using Planck 2018 data and sample this likelihood to obtain Bayesian
evidences. Priors are justified and used to put Ekpyrotic models and inflation
on equal footing. We find reasonable preference for one of the considered
Ekpyrotic models over the others, but that even this one is disfavored compared

Abstract:  This contribution focuses on a rare example of the class of post-Red
Supergiants, IRAS 17163-3907, the central star of the Fried Egg nebula. In
particular, we discuss some of our recently published results in detail. The
inner parts of the circumstellar environment of this evolved massive star are
probed at milli-arcsec resolution using VLTI's GRAVITY instrument operating in
the K-band (2 $\mu$m), while larger, arcsecond, scales are probed by VISIR
diffraction limited images around 10 $\mu$m, supplemented by a complete
Spectral Energy Distribution. The spectro-interferometric data cover important
diagnostic lines (Br$\gamma$, Na I), which we are able to constrain spatially.
Both the presence and size of the Na I doublet in emission has been
traditionally challenging to explain towards other objects of this class. In
this study we show that a two-zone model in Local Thermal Equilibrium can
reproduce both the observed sizes and strengths of the emission lines observed
in the K-band, without the need of a pseudo-photosphere. In addition, we find
evidence for the presence of a third hot inner shell, and demonstrate that the
star has undergone at least three mass-loss episodes over roughly the past
century. To explain the properties of the observed non-steady mass-loss we
explore pulsation-driven and line-driven mass-loss and introduce the
bi-stability jump as a possible underlying mechanism to explain mass-loss
towards Yellow Hypergiants.

Title:Co-evolution of the Brightest Cluster Galaxies and their Host Clusters in IllustrisTNG,"
Abstract:  We use the IllustrisTNG simulations to explore the dynamic scaling relation
between massive clusters and their central galaxies (BCGs). The Illustris
TNG300-1 simulation we use includes 280 massive clusters with $M_{200} >
10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ enabling a robust statistical analysis. We derive the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the stellar particles of the BCGs
($\sigma_{*, BCG}$), analogous to the observed BCG stellar velocity dispersion.
We also compute the subhalo velocity dispersion to measure the cluster velocity
dispersion ($\sigma_{cl}$). Both $\sigma_{*, BCG}$ and $\sigma_{cl}$ are
proportional to the cluster halo mass, but the slopes differ slightly. Thus
like the observed relation, $\sigma_{*, BCG} / \sigma_{cl}$ declines as a
function of $\sigma_{cl}$, but the scatter is large. We explore the redshift
evolution of $\sigma_{*, BCG} - \sigma_{cl}$ scaling relation for $z \lesssim
1$ in a way that can be compared directly with observations. The scaling
relation has a similar slope at high redshift, but the scatter increases
because of the large scatter in $\sigma_{*, BCG}$. The simulations imply that
high redshift BCGs are dynamically more complex than their low redshift
counterparts.

Title:Extremely massive disc galaxies in the nearby Universe form through gas-rich minor mergers,"
Abstract:  In our hierarchical structure-formation paradigm, the observed morphological
evolution of massive galaxies -- from rotationally-supported discs to
dispersion-dominated spheroids -- is largely explained via galaxy merging.
However, since mergers are likely to destroy discs, and the most massive
galaxies have the richest merger histories, it is surprising that any discs
exist at all at the highest stellar masses. Recent theoretical work by our
group has used a cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation to suggest that
extremely massive (M* > 10^11.4 MSun) discs form primarily via minor mergers
between spheroids and gas-rich satellites, which create new rotational stellar
components and leave discs as remnants. Here, we use UV-optical and HI data of
massive galaxies, from the SDSS, GALEX, DECaLS and ALFALFA surveys, to test
these theoretical predictions. Observed massive discs account for ~13% of
massive galaxies, in good agreement with theory (~11%). ~64% of the observed
massive discs exhibit tidal features, which are likely to indicate recent minor
mergers, in the deep DECaLS images (compared to ~60% in their simulated
counterparts). The incidence of these features is at least four times higher
than in low-mass discs, suggesting that, as predicted, minor mergers play a
significant (and outsized) role in the formation of these systems. The
empirical star-formation rates agree well with theoretical predictions and, for
a small galaxy sample with HI detections, the HI masses and fractions are
consistent with the range predicted by the simulation. The good agreement
between theory and observations indicates that extremely massive discs are
indeed remnants of recent minor mergers between spheroids and gas-rich
satellites.

Abstract:  We measure the size-luminosity relation of photometrically-selected galaxies
within the redshift range $z\sim6-9$, using galaxies lensed by six foreground
Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) clusters. The power afforded by strong
gravitational lensing allows us to observe fainter and smaller galaxies than in
blank fields. We select our sample of galaxies and obtain their properties,
e.g., redshift, magnitude, from the photometrically-derived ASTRODEEP
catalogues. The intrinsic size is measured with the Lenstruction software, and
completeness maps are created as a function of size and luminosity via the
GLACiAR2 software. We perform a Bayesian analysis to estimate the intrinsic and
incompleteness-corrected size-luminosity distribution, with parameterization
$r_e \propto L^\beta$. We find slopes of $\beta\sim0.48\pm0.08$ at $z\sim6-7$
and $\beta\sim0.68\pm0.14$ at $z\sim8.5$, adopting the Bradac lens model. The
slope derived by lensed galaxies is steeper than that obtained in blank fields
and is consistent with other independent determinations of the size-luminosity
relation from the HFF dataset. We also investigate the systematic uncertainties
correlated with the choice of lens models, finding that the slopes of
size-luminosity relations derived from different models are consistent with
each other, i.e. the modeling errors are not a significant source of
uncertainty in the size-luminosity relation.

known to date (z$\sim$6.1). From the C$\rm IV$$\lambda$1549 broad emission line
we found that PSO J0309+27 is powered by a
1.45$^{+1.89}_{-0.85}$$\times$10$^9$M$_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole (SMBH)
with a bolometric luminosity of $\sim$8$\times$10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and an
Eddington ratio equal to 0.44$^{+0.78}_{-0.35}$. We also obtained new
photometric observations with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in J and K bands
to better constrain the NIR Spectral Energy Distribution of the source. Thanks
to these observations, we were able to model the accretion disk and to derive
an independent estimate of the black hole mass of PSO J0309+27, confirming the
value inferred from the virial technique. The existence of such a massive SMBH
just $\sim$900 million years after the Big Bang challenges models of the
earliest SMBH growth, especially if jetted Active Galactic Nuclei are
associated to a highly spinning black hole as currently thought. Indeed, in a
Eddington-limited accretion scenario and assuming a radiative efficiency of
0.3, typical of a fast rotating SMBH, a seed black hole of more than 10$^6$
M$_{\odot}$ at z = 30 is required to reproduce the mass of PSO J0309+27 at
redshift 6. This requirement suggests either earlier periods of rapid black
hole growth with super-Eddington accretion and/or that only part of the
released gravitational energy goes to heat the accretion disk and feed the
black hole.

observed in the inner cavity of the disk in both the sub-millimeter (ALMA;
1.3mm, $^{12}$CO) and near-infrared (SPHERE; 1.5-2.5$\mu$m) wavelengths which
have been claimed to arise from dynamical interactions with a massive
companion. In this work, we present new deep $K_s$ (2.16$\mu$m) and L'
(3.7$\mu$m) band images of AB Aurigae obtained with LMIRCam on the Large
Binocular Telescope, aimed for the detection of both planetary companions and
extended disk structures. No point source is recovered, in particular at the
outer regions of the disk, where a putative candidate ($\rho = 0.681"", PA =
7.6^{\circ}$) had been previously claimed. The nature of a second innermost
planet candidate ($\rho = 0.16'', PA = 203.9^{\circ}$) can not be investigated
by the new data. We are able to derive 5$\sigma$ detection limits in both
magnitude and mass for the system, going from 14 \Mjup at 0.3'' (49 au) down to
3-4 \Mjup at 0.6'' (98 au) and beyond, based on the ATMO 2020 evolutionary

polarimetric H-band observations. We also recover the ring structure of the
system at larger separation (0.5-0.7"") showing a clear south-east/north-west
asymmetry. This structure, observed for the first time at L'-band, remains
interior to the dust cavity seen at ALMA, suggesting an efficient dust trapping
mechanism at play in the disk.

PSF subtraction, we detect the disk at high signal to noise in all three bands.
We find strong morphological differences between bands, including asymmetries
consistent with observed spiral arms within 100 AU in L'. An apparent deficit
of scattered light at 3.08 ${\mu}$m relative to bracketing wavelengths (Ks and
L') is evocative of ice absorption at the disk surface layer. However, the
${\Delta}$(Ks-H2O) color is consistent with grains with little to no ice (0-5%
by mass). The ${\Delta}$(H2O-L') color, conversely, suggests grains with a much
higher ice mass fraction (~0.68), and the two colors cannot be reconciled under
a single grain population model. Additionally, we find the extremely red
${\Delta}$(Ks-L') disk color cannot be reproduced under conventional scattered
light modeling with any combination of grain parameters or reasonable local
extinction values. We hypothesize that the scattering surfaces at the three
wavelengths are not co-located, and optical depth effects result in each
wavelength probing the grain population at different disk surface depths. The
morphological similarity between Ks and H2O suggests their scattering surfaces
are near one another, lending credence to the ${\Delta}$(Ks-H2O) disk color
constraint of < 5% ice mass fraction for the outermost scattering disk layer.

Title:Development and characterization of a fast and low noise readout for the next generation X-ray CCDs,"
Abstract:  The broad energy response, low electronic read noise, and good energy
resolution have made X-ray Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs) an obvious choice for
developing soft X-ray astronomical instruments over the last half century. They

However, the next generation X-ray telescopic experiments propose for
significantly larger collecting area compared to the existing observatories in
order to explore the low luminosity and high redshift X-ray universe which
requires these detectors to have an order of magnitude faster readout. In this

electronics for X-ray CCDs. At SU, we have designed and developed a fast and
low noise readout module with the goal of achieving a readout speed of 5
Mpixel/s. We successfully ran a prototype CCD matrix of 512 $\times$ 512 pixels
at 4 Mpixels/s. In this paper, we describe the details of the readout
electronics and report the performance of the detectors at these readout speeds
in terms of read noise and energy resolution. In the future, we plan to
continue to improve performance of the readout module and eventually converge
to a dedicated ASIC based readout system to enable parallel read out of large
array multi-node CCD devices.

Title:Further Evidence for the Minifilament-Eruption Scenario for Solar Polar Coronal Jets,"
Abstract:  We examine a sampling of 23 polar-coronal-hole jets. We first identified the
jets in soft X-ray (SXR) images from the X-ray telescope (XRT) on the Hinode
spacecraft, over 2014-2016. During this period, frequently the polar holes were
small or largely obscured by foreground coronal haze, often making jets
difficult to see. We selected 23 jets among those adequately visible during
this period, and examined them further using Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171, 193, 211, and 304 Ang images. In SXRs
we track the lateral drift of the jet spire relative to the jet base's jet
bright point (JBP). In 22 of 23 jets the spire either moves away from (18
cases) or is stationary relative to (4 cases) the JBP. The one exception where
the spire moved toward the JBP may be a consequence of line-of-sight projection
effects at the limb. From the AIA images, we clearly identify an erupting
minifilament in 20 of the 23 jets, while the remainder are consistent with such
an eruption having taken place. We also confirm that some jets can trigger
onset of nearby ""sympathetic"" jets, likely because eruption of the minifilament
field of the first jet removes magnetic constraints on the base-field region of
the second jet. The propensity for spire drift away from the JBP, the
identification of the erupting minifilament in the majority of jets, and the
magnetic-field topological changes that lead to sympathetic jets, all support
or are consistent with the minifilament-eruption model for jets.

Title:The Edge-on Galaxies in the Pan-STARRS survey (EGIPS),"
Abstract:  We present a catalogue of 16551 edge-on galaxies created using the public DR2
data of the Pan-STARRS survey. The catalogue covers the three quarters of the
sky above Dec.=-30 degrees. The galaxies were selected using a convolutional
neural network, trained on a sample of edge-on galaxies identified earlier in
the SDSS survey. This approach allows us to dramatically improve the quality of
the candidate selection and perform a thorough visual inspection in a
reasonable amount of time. The catalogue provides homogeneous information on
astrometry, SExtractor photometry, and non-parametric morphological statistics
of the galaxies. The photometry is reliably for objects in the 13.8-17.4 r-band
magnitude range. According to the HyperLeda database, redshifts are known for
about 63 percent of the galaxies in the catalogue. Our sample is well separated
into the red sequence and blue cloud galaxy populations. The edge-on galaxies
of the red sequence are systematically Delta(g-i)~0.1 mag redder than galaxies
oriented at an arbitrary angle to the observer. We found a variation of the
galaxy thickness with the galaxy colour. The red sequence galaxies are thicker
than the galaxies of the blue cloud. In the blue cloud, on average, thinner
galaxies turn out to be bluer. In the future, based on this catalogue it is
intended to explore the three-dimensional structure of galaxies of different
morphologies, as well as to study the scaling relations for discs and bulges.

Title:The forward and reverse shock dynamics of Cassiopeia A,"
Abstract:  We report on proper motion measurements of the forward- and reverse-shock
regions of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), including
deceleration/acceleration measurements of the forward shock. The measurements
combine 19 years of observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, using the
4.2-6 keV continuum band, preferentially targeting X-ray synchrotron radiation.
The average expansion rate is $0.218 \pm 0.029$%yr$^{-1}$ for the forward
shock, corresponding to a velocity of $\approx 5800$ km/s. The time derivative
of the proper motions indicates deceleration in the east, and an acceleration
up to $1.1\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-2}$ in the western part. The reverse shock
moves outward in the East, but in the West it moves toward the center with an
expansion rate of $-0.0225\pm 0.0007$ %yr$^{-1}$, corresponding to $-1884\pm
17$ km/s. In the West the reverse shock velocity in the ejecta frame is
$\gtrsim 3000$ km/s, peaking at $\sim 8000$ km/s, explaining the presence of
X-ray synchrotron emitting filaments there. The backward motion of the reverse
shock can be explained by either a scenario in which the forward shock
encountered a partial, dense, wind shell, or one in which the shock
transgressed initially through a lopsided cavity, created during a brief
Wolf-Rayet star phase. Both scenarios are consistent with the local
acceleration of the forward shock. Finally we report on the proper motion of
the northeastern jet, using both the X-ray continuum band, and the Si XIII
K-line emission band. We find expansion rates of respectively 0.21%yr$^{-1}$
and 0.24%yr$^{-1}$, corresponding to velocities at the tip of the X-ray jet of
7830--9200 km/s.

Title:Optical Rebrightening of Extragalactic Transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility,"
Abstract:  Ongoing large-scale optical time-domain surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF), are producing alerts at unprecedented rates. Analysis of
transient sources has so far followed two distinct paths: archival analysis of
data on transient sources at a time when they are no longer observable and
real-time analysis at the time when the sources are first detected. The latter
is the realm of alert brokers such as the Arizona-NOIRLab Temporal Analysis and
Response to Events System (ANTARES). In this paper, we synthesize the two
analysis paths and present a first systematic study of archival alert-broker
data, focusing on extragalactic transients with multipeaked light curves
identified in the ANTARES archive of ZTF alerts. Our analysis yields a sample
of 37 such sources, including core-collapse supernovae (with two analogs of
iPTF14hls), thermonuclear supernovae interacting with their surrounding
circumstellar medium, tidal disruption events, luminous blue variables, and as
yet unclassified objects. A large fraction of the identified sources is
currently active, warranting allocation of follow-up resources in the immediate
future to further constrain their nature and the physical processes at work.

Title:A Robust Hot Subdwarfs Identification Method Based on Deep Learning,"
Abstract:  Hot subdwarf star is a particular type of star that is crucial for studying
binary evolution and atmospheric diffusion processes. In recent years,
identifying Hot subdwarfs by machine learning methods has become a hot topic,
but there are still limitations in automation and accuracy. In this paper, we
proposed a robust identification method based on the convolutional neural
network (CNN). We first constructed the dataset using the spectral data of
LAMOS DR7-V1. We then constructed a hybrid recognition model including an
8-class classification model and a binary classification model. The model
achieved an accuracy of 96.17% on the testing set. To further validate the
accuracy of the model, we selected 835 Hot subdwarfs that were not involved in
the training process from the identified LAMOST catalog (2428, including
repeated observations) as the validation set. An accuracy of 96.05% was
achieved. On this basis, we used the model to filter and classify all
10,640,255 spectra of LAMOST DR7-V1, and obtained a catalog of 2393 Hot
subdwarf candidates, of which 2067 have been confirmed. We found 25 new Hot
subdwarfs among the remaining candidates by manual validation. The overall
accuracy of the model is 87.42%. Overall, the model presented in this study can
effectively identify specific spectra with robust results and high accuracy,
and can be further applied to the classification of large-scale spectra and the
search of specific targets.

Title:Magnetic Spirals in Accretion Flows Originated from Misaligned Magnetic Field,"
Abstract:  Misalignment between rotation and magnetic field has been suggested to be one
type of physical mechanisms which can easen the effects of magnetic braking
during collapse of cloud cores leading to formation of protostellar disks.
However, its essential factors are poorly understood. Therefore, we perform a
more detailed analysis of the physics involved. We analyze existing simulation
data to measure the system torques, mass accretion rates and Toomre Q
parameters. We also examine the presence of shocks in the system. While
advective torques are generally the strongest, we find that magnetic and
gravitational torques can play substantial roles in how angular momentum is
transferred during the disk formation process. Magnetic torques can shape the
accretion flows, creating two-armed magnetized inflow spirals aligned with the
magnetic field. We find evidence of an accretion shock that is aligned
according to the spiral structure of the system. Inclusion of ambipolar
diffusion as explored in this work has shown a slight influence in the small
scale structures but not in the main morphology. We discuss potential candidate
systems where some of these phenomena could be present.

"Title:Homologous Accelerated Electron Beams, Quasi-periodic fast-propagating Wave and CME Observed in one Fan-spine Jet","
Abstract:  Using imaging and radio multi-wavelength observations, we studied the origin
of two homologous accelerated electron beams and a quasi-periodic
fast-propagating (QFP) wave train associated with a solar jet on 2012 July 14.
The jet occurred in a small-scale fan-spine magnetic system embedding in a
large-scale pseudostreamer, which associated with a GOES C1.4 flare, a jet-like
coronal mass ejection (CME), a type II radio burst, and a type III radio burst.
During the initial stage, a QFP wave train and a fast moving on-disk radio
source were detected in succession ahead of the jet along the outer spine of
the fan-spine system. When the jet reached a height of about 1.3 solar radii,
it underwent a bifurcation into two branches. Based on our analysis results,
all the observed phenomena in association with the jet can be explained by
using a fan-spine magnetic system. We propose that both the type III radio
burst and the on-disk fast moving radio source were caused by the same physical
process, i.e., the energetic electrons accelerated by the magnetic reconnection
at the null point, and they were along the open field lines of the
pseudostreamer and the closed outer spine of the fan-spine structure,
respectively. Due to the bifurcation of the jet body, the lower branch along
the closed outer spine of the fan-spine structure fell back to the solar
surface, while the upper branch along the open field lines of the
pseudostreamer caused the jet-like CME in the outer corona.

Title:Is the Hubble crisis connected with the extinction of dinosaurs?,"
Abstract:  It has recently been suggested that a gravitational transition of the
effective Newton's constant $G_{\rm eff}$ by about 10%, taking place 50-150
Myrs ago, can lead to the resolution of both the Hubble crisis and the growth
tension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Hints for such an abrupt transition
with weaker gravity at times before the transition, have recently been
identified in Tully Fisher galactic mass-velocity data and also in Cepheid SnIa
calibrator data. Here we use Monte-Carlo simulations to show that such a
transition could significantly increase (by a factor of 3 or more) the number
of long period comets (LPCs) impacting the solar system from the Oort cloud
(semi-major axis of orbits $\gtrsim 10^4AU$). This increase is consistent with
observational evidence from the terrestrial and lunar cratering rates
indicating that the impact flux of kilometer sized objects increased by at
least a factor of 2 over that last 100 Myrs compared to the long term average.
This increase may also be connected with the Chicxulub impactor event that
produced the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) extinction of 75% of life on Earth
(including dinosaurs) about 66 Myrs ago. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to show
that for isotropic Oort cloud comet distribution with initially circular
orbits, random velocity perturbations (induced eg by passing stars and/or
galactic tidal effects), lead to a deformation of the orbits that increases
significantly when $G_{\rm eff}$ increases. A 10% increase of $G_{\rm eff}$
leads to an increase in the probability of the comets to enter the loss cone
and reach the planetary region (pericenter of less than 10AU) by a factor that
ranges from 5% (for velocity perturbation much smaller than the comet initial
velocity) to more than 300% (for total velocity perturbations comparable with
the initial comet velocity).

Title:A Note on the Abundance of Primordial Black Holes: Use and Misuse of the Metric Curvature Perturbation,"
Abstract:  The formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) through the collapse of large
fluctuations in the early universe is a rare event. This manifests itself, for
instance, through the non-Gaussian tail of the formation probability. To
compute such probability and the abundance of PBHs, the curvature perturbation
is frequently adopted. In this note we emphasize that its use does not provide
the correct PBH formation probability. Through a path-integral approach we show
that the exact calculation of the PBH abundance demands the knowledge of
multivariate joint probabilities of the curvature perturbation or,
equivalently, of all the corresponding connected correlators.

Title:A minimal self tuning model to solve the cosmological constant problem,"
Abstract:  The expansion of the Universe is observed to be accelerating, with the
simplest solution being a classical cosmological constant. However, this
receives contributions from the quantum vacuum, which are predicted to be many
orders of magnitude larger than observations, and suffers from radiative
instabilities requiring repeated fine tuning. In this paper we present a
minimal, self tuning scalar field model that can dynamically cancel a large
quantum vacuum energy, avoiding Weinberg's No Go Theorem, and produce
accelerated de Sitter expansion at a lower energy scale as a solution to the
problem. Our minimal model, which contains a non canonical kinetic energy and a
linear potential, belongs to the Kinetic Gravity Braiding subclass of Horndeski
theory which is not observationally excluded, and lies outside of the known Fab
Four or Well Tempered models. We find analytic solutions in the limits of slow
roll and fast roll, and numerically solve the equations of motion to illustrate
our model. We show that the model allows for a matter dominated era, and that
the attractor solution is stable under a phase transition in the vacuum energy
density. We also consider the energy scales required to match observations. Our
model shows the existence of a wider class of successful self tuning models
than previously assumed.

Title:The saturation of the VSI in protoplanetary disks via parametric instability,"
Abstract:  The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a robust and potentially important
phenomenon in irradiated protoplanetary disks (PPDs), yet the mechanism by
which it saturates remains poorly understood. Global simulations suggest that
the non-linear evolution of the VSI is dominated by radially propagating
inertial wavetrains (called `body modes'), but these are known to be
susceptible to a parametric instability. In this paper, we propose that the
global VSI saturates via this secondary instability, which initiates a
redistribution of energy from the large scales to smaller-scale inertial waves,
and finally into a turbulent cascade. We present an analytic theory of the
instability in a simple idealised model that captures the main physical and
mathematical details of the problem. In addition, we conduct numerical
simulations with the SNOOPY code to consolidate the theory. Once the parametric
instability prevails, the VSI is likely far more disordered and incoherent than
current global simulations suggest. We also argue that it is challenging to
capture parametric instability in global simulations unless the radial
resolution is very fine, possibly $\sim 300$ grid cells per scale height in
radius.

Abstract:  We study stellar population and structural properties of massive
$\log(M_{\star} / M_{\odot}) > 11$ galaxies at $z\sim2.7$ in the Magneticum
(box 3) and IllustrisTNG (TNG100, TNG300) hydrodynamical simulations. We find
stellar mass functions broadly consistent with observations, with no scarcity
of massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2.7$, but with a higher quiescent
galaxy fraction at high masses in IllustrisTNG. Average ages of simulated
quiescent galaxies are between 0.8 and 1.0 Gyr, older by a factor $\sim2$ than
observed in spectroscopically-confirmed quiescent galaxies at similar redshift.
Besides being potentially indicative of issues with star-formation recipes in
simulations, this discrepancy might also be partly explained by limitations in
the estimation of observed ages. We investigate the purity of simulated UVJ
rest-frame colorselected massive quiescent samples with photometric
uncertainties typical of deep surveys (e.g., COSMOS). We find evidence for
significant contamination (up to 60 percent) by dusty star-forming galaxies in
the UVJ region that is typically populated by older quiescent sources.
Furthermore, simulations suggest that the completeness of UVJ-selected
quiescent samples at this redshift may be reduced by 30 percent due to a high
fraction of young quiescent galaxies not entering the UVJ quiescent region.
Massive, quiescent galaxies in simulations have on average lower angular
momenta and higher projected axis ratios and concentrations than star-forming
counterparts. Average sizes of simulated quiescent galaxies are relatively
close to observed ones, and broadly consistent within the uncertainties. The
average size ratio of quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the probed mass
range is formally consistent with observations, although this result is partly
affected by poor statistics.

Title:Gaia EDR3 distances of the young stellar clusters in the extended Carina Nebula complex,"
Abstract:  Context: The Carina Nebula complex (CNC) is one of the most massive and
active star-forming regions in our Galaxy and it contains several large young
star clusters. The distances of the individual clusters and their physical
connection were poorly known up to now, with strongly discrepant results
reported in the literature. Aims: We want to determine reliable distances of
the young stellar clusters in the central Carina Nebula region (in particular,
Tr 14, 15, and 16) and the prominent clusters NGC 3324 and NGC 3293 in the
northwestern periphery of the CNC. Methods: We analyzed the parallaxes in Gaia
EDR3 for a comprehensive sample of 237 spectroscopically identified OB stars,
as well as for 9562 X-ray-selected young stars throughout the complex. We also
performed an astrometric analysis to identify members of the young cluster vdBH
99, which is located in the foreground of the northwestern part of the Carina
Nebula. Results: We find that the distances of the investigated clusters in the
CNC are equal within <= 2%, and yield very consistent most likely mean distance
values of 2.36(+0.05 -0.05) kpc for the OB star sample and 2.34(+0.05 -0.06)
kpc for the sample of X-ray-selected young stars. Conclusions: Our results show
that the clusters in the CNC constitute a coherent star-forming region, in
particular with regard to NGC 3324 and NGC 3293 at the northwestern periphery,
which are (within <= 2%) at the same distance as the central Carina Nebula. For
the foreground cluster vdBH 99, we find a mean distance of 441(+2 -2) pc and an
age of ~ 60 Myr. We quantified the contamination of X-ray-selected samples of
Carina Nebula stars based on members of this foreground cluster.

Title:The Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey: Changing-Look Quasar Candidates from Multi-Epoch Spectroscopy in SDSS-IV,"
Abstract:  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) can vary significantly in their rest-frame
optical/UV continuum emission, and with strong associated changes in broad line
emission, on much shorter timescales than predicted by standard models of
accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Most such ``changing-look'' or
""changing-state"" AGN -- and at higher luminosities, changing-look quasars
(CLQs) -- have been found via spectroscopic follow-up of known quasars showing
strong photometric variability. The Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey of SDSS-IV
includes repeat spectroscopy of large numbers of previously-known quasars, many
selected irrespective of photometric variability, and with spectral epochs
separated by months to decades. Our visual examination of these repeat spectra
for strong broad line variability yielded 61 newly-discovered CLQ candidates.
We quantitatively compare spectral epochs to measure changes in continuum and
H$\beta$ broad line emission, finding 19 CLQs, of which 15 are
newly-recognized. The parent sample includes only broad line quasars, so our
study tends to find objects that have dimmed, i.e., turn-off CLQs. However, we
nevertheless find 4 turn-on CLQs that meet our criteria, albeit with broad
lines in both dim and bright states. We study the response of H$\beta$ and MgII
emission lines to continuum changes. The Eddington ratios of CLQs are low,
and/or their H$\beta$ broad line width is large relative to the overall quasar
population. Repeat quasar spectroscopy in the upcoming SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper
program will reveal significant numbers of CLQs, enhancing our understanding of
the frequency and duty-cycle of such strong variability, and the physics and
dynamics of the phenomenon.

"Title:The earliest O-type eclipsing binary in the Small Magellanic Cloud, AzV 476: A comprehensive analysis reveals surprisingly low stellar masses","
Abstract:  Massive stars at low metallicity are among the main feedback agents in the
early Universe and in present-day star forming galaxies. When in binaries,
these stars are potential progenitors of gravitational-wave events. Knowledge
of stellar masses is a prerequisite to understanding evolution and feedback of
low-metallicity massive stars. Using abundant spectroscopic and photometric
measurements of an outstandingly bright eclipsing binary, we compare its
dynamic, spectroscopic, and evolutionary mass estimates and develop a binary
evolution scenario. We comprehensively studied the eclipsing binary system, AzV
476, in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The light curve and radial velocities were
analyzed to obtain the orbital parameters. The photometric and spectroscopic
data in the UV and optical were analyzed using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet model
atmospheres. The obtained results are interpreted using binary-evolution
tracks. AzV 476 consists of an O4IV-III((f))p primary and an O9.5:Vn secondary.
Both components have similar current masses (~20 M$_{\odot}$) obtained from
both the orbital and spectroscopic analysis. The wind mass-loss rate of
log($\dot{M}$/(M$_{\odot}$/yr))=-6.2 of the primary is a factor of ten higher
than a recent empirical prescription for single O stars in the SMC. Only
close-binary evolution with mass transfer can reproduce the current stellar and
orbital parameters. The binary evolutionary model reveals that the primary has
lost about half of its initial mass and is already core helium burning. Our
comprehensive analysis of AzV 476 yields a consistent set of parameters and
suggests previous case B mass transfer. The derived stellar masses agree within
their uncertainties. The moderate masses of AzV 476 underline the scarcity of
bright massive stars in the SMC. The core helium burning nature of the primary
indicates that stripped stars might be hidden among OB-type populations.

"Title:A global two-layer radiative transfer model for axisymmetric, shadowed protoplanetary disks","
Abstract:  Understanding the thermal structure of protoplanetary disks is crucial for
modeling planet formation and interpreting disk observations. We present a new
two-layer radiative transfer model for computing the thermal structure of
axisymmetric irradiated disks. Unlike the standard two-layer model, our model
accounts for the radial as well as vertical transfer of the starlight
reprocessed at the disk surface. The model thus allows us to compute the
temperature below ""shadowed"" surfaces receiving no direct starlight. Thanks to
the assumed axisymmetry, the reprocessed starlight flux is given in
one-dimensional integral form that can be computed at a low cost. Furthermore,
our model evolves the midplane temperature using a time-dependent energy
equation and can therefore treat thermal instabilities. We apply our global
two-layer model to disks with a planetary induced gap and confirm that the
model reproduces the disks' temperature profiles obtained from more
computationally expensive Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations to an
accuracy of less than 20%. We also apply the model to study the long-term
behavior of the thermal wave instability in irradiated disks. Being simple and
computationally efficient, the global two-layer model will be suitable for
studying the interplay between disks' thermal evolution and dust evolution.

Title:Dependence of the flux of gamma-ray pulsars on distance: A nonparametric analysis of the data in the second FERMI catalogue,"
Abstract:  Pulsars' gamma-ray luminosities are thought to exceed their radio
luminosities by several orders of magnitude: a notion that is based on the
assumption that the decay with distance of the flux of gamma-ray pulses obeys
the inverse-square law as does that of the flux of radio pulses. However,
results of testing the hypothesis of independence of luminosities and distances
of gamma-ray pulsars by means of the Efron--Petrosian statistic imply that the
observational data in the second {\it FERMI} catalogue are consistent with the
dependence $S\propto D^{-3/2}$ of the flux densities $S$ of these pulsars on
their distances $D$ at substantially higher levels of significance than they
are with the dependence $S\propto D^{-2}$. This is not incompatible with the
requirements of the conservation of energy because the radiation process
described in Ardavan [{\it Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.}, {\bf 507}, 4530--4563
(2021)], by which the superluminally moving current sheet in the magnetosphere
of a neutron star is shown to generate the observed gamma-ray pulses, is
intrinsically transient: the difference in the fluxes of power across any two
spheres centred on the star is balanced by the change with time of the energy
contained inside the shell bounded by those spheres. Once the over-estimation
of their values is rectified, the luminosities of gamma-ray pulsars turn out to
have the same range of values as do the luminosities of radio pulsars.

Abstract:  Multiband optical photometry data of blazar S5 0716+714 obtained from 2002 to
2019 reveal stable color index change with flux variability. We analyzed this
trend under variability caused by the Doppler factor change in the presence of
a curved photon energy spectrum. A break in the energy spectrum of emitting
electrons, caused by radiative losses, or log-parabolic electron energy
distribution, or the synchrotron self-absorption acting in a compact jet part
forms such the photon spectrum. We explained the observed color index change
with variability by geometric effects only under the assumption that the
radiating region is the synchrotron self-absorbed core and the bright optically
thin jet. In this framework, we estimated the magnetic field strength in the
optically thick part of the radiating region. These values correspond to other
independent estimates of the magnetic field near the black hole, further
supporting our assumption.

Title:Squeezing Cosmological Phase Transitions with International Pulsar Timing Array,"
Abstract:  A first-order MeV-scale cosmological phase transition (PT) can generate a
peak in the power spectrum of stochastic gravitational wave background around
nanohertz frequencies. With the recent International Pulsar Timing Array data
release two covering nanohertz frequencies, we search for such a phase
transition signal. For the standard 4-parameter PT model, we obtain the PT
temperature $T_\star\in$ [66 MeV, 30 GeV], which indicates that dark or QCD
phase transitions occurring below 66 MeV have been ruled out at $2\,\sigma$
confidence level. This constraint is much tighter than $T_\star\sim$ [1 MeV,
100 GeV] from NANOGrav. We also give much tighter $2\,\sigma$ bounds on the PT
duration $H_\star/\beta>0.1$, strength $\alpha_\star>0.39$ and friction
$\eta<2.74$ than NANOGrav. For the first time, we find a positive correlation
between $\mathrm{log}_{10}T_\star$ and $\mathrm{log}_{10}H_\star/\beta$
implying that PT temperature increases with increasing bubble nucleation rate.
To avoid large theoretical uncertainties in calculating PT spectrum, we make
bubble spectral shape parameters $a$, $b$, $c$ and four PT parameters free
together, and confront this model with data. We find that pulsar timing is very
sensitive to the parameter $a$, and give the first clear constraint
$a=1.27_{-0.54}^{+0.71}$ at $1\,\sigma$ confidence level.

power-law size distributions can well reproduce its unusual extinction curves.
The best-fit results show that the extinctions derived from the dust models are
consistent with the observed values at all epochs. However, the
total-to-selective extinction ratio $R_V$ is about 2.8 - 3.1, which is
significantly smaller than the value of $R_V \approx 6.4$ derived by Gall et
al. The best-fit models indicate that the dust grains around SN 2010jl are
possibly composed of small-size astronomical silicate grains and micron-size
graphite grains. In addition, by fitting the optical to mid-infrared spectral
energy distribution, we find that the dust mass around SN 2010jl increases with
time, up to $0.005\,M_{\odot}$ around 1300 days after peak brightness, which is
consistent with previous estimates.

Title:Quintessence or Phantom: Study of scalar field dark energy models through a general parametrization of the Hubble parameter,"
Abstract:  In this work we propose a simple general parametrization scheme of the Hubble
parameter for the scalar field dark energy models. In our approach it is
possible to incorporate both the quintessence and phantom scalar field in a
single analytical scheme and write down relevant cosmological parameters which
are independent of the nature of the scalar field. A general condition for the
phantom barrier crossing has also been obtained. To test this approach, a well
behaved parametrization of the normalized Hubble parameter has been considered
and a wide variety of observational data like CMB data, Supernovae data, BAO
data etc. has been used to constraint the various cosmological parameters. It
has been found that data prefer the present value of the equation of state of
the dark energy to be in the phantom domain. One interesting outcome of this
analysis is that although the current value of the dark energy equation of
state is phantom in nature, a phantom crossing of the EOS has taken place in
the recent past. We have also carried out the Bayesian model comparison between
$\Lambda CDM$ model and the proposed model which indicates that this model is
favored by data as compared to $\Lambda CDM$ model.

Title:Modeling Photoionized Turbulent Material in the Circumgalactic Medium III: Effects of Co-rotation and Magnetic Fields,"
Abstract:  Absorption-line measurements of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) display a
highly non-uniform distribution of lower ionization state species accompanied
by more widespread higher ionization state material. This suggests that the CGM
is a dynamic, multiphase medium, such as arises in the presence of turbulence.
To better understand this evolution, we perform hydrodynamic and
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the CGM surrounding Milky Way-like
galaxies. In both cases, the CGM is initially in hydrostatic balance in a
$10^{12}$ solar masses dark matter gravitational potential, and the simulations
include rotation in the inner halo and turbulence that decreases radially. They
also track ionizations, recombinations, and species-by-species radiative
cooling in the presence of the redshift-zero UV background, employing the
MAIHEM non-equilibrium chemistry package. We find that after 9 Gyrs of
evolution, the presence of a magnetic field leads to an overall hotter CGM,
with cool gas in the center where magnetic pressure dominates. While the
non-MHD run produces more cold clouds overall, we find similar Si IV/O VI and N
V/O VI ratios between the MHD and non-MHD runs, which are both very different
from their equilibrium values. The non-MHD halo develops cool, low angular
momentum filaments above the central disk, in comparison to the MHD run that
has more efficient angular momentum transport, especially for the cold gas
which forms a more ordered and extended disk late into its evolution.

Title:Probing multiphase gas in local massive elliptical galaxies via multiwavelength observations,"
Abstract:  We investigate the cold and warm gas content, kinematics, and spatial
distribution of six local massive elliptical galaxies to probe the origin of
the multiphase gas in their atmospheres. We report new observations, including
SOFIA [CII], ALMA CO, MUSE H$\alpha$+[NII] and VLA radio observations. These
are complemented by a large suite of multiwavelength archival datasets,
including thermodynamical properties of the hot gas and radio jets, which are
leveraged to investigate the role of AGN feeding/feedback in regulating the
multiphase gas content. Our galaxy sample shows a significant diversity in cool
gas content, spanning filamentary and rotating structures. In our non-central
galaxies, the distribution of such gas is often concentrated, at variance with
the more extended features observed in central galaxies. Misalignment between
the multiphase gas and stars suggest that stellar mass loss is not the primary
driver. A fraction of the cool gas might be acquired via galaxy interactions,
but we do not find quantitative evidence of mergers in most of our systems.
Instead, key evidence supports the origin via condensation out of the diffuse
halo. Comparing with Chaotic Cold Accretion (CCA) simulations, we find that our
cool gas-free galaxies are likely in the overheated phase of the self-regulated
AGN cycle, while for our galaxies with cool gas the k-plot and AGN power
correlation corroborate the phase of CCA feeding in which the condensation rain
is triggering more vigorous AGN heating. The related C-ratio further shows that
central/non-central galaxies are expected to generate an extended/inner rain,
consistent with our sample.

"Title:MUSE spectroscopy of the ULX NGC 1313 X-1: a shock-ionised bubble, an X-ray photoionised nebula, and two supernova remnants","
Abstract:  The presence of large ionised gaseous nebulae found around some ultraluminous
X-ray sources (ULXs) provides the means to assess the mechanical and radiative
feedback of the central source, and hence constrain the efficiency and impact
on the surroundings of the super-Eddington regime powering most of these
sources. NGC 1313 X--1 is an archetypal ULX which has been reported to be
surrounded by abnormally high [O I]$\lambda$6300/H$\alpha >$ 0.1 ratios and for
which high-resolution spectroscopy in X-rays has hinted the presence of
powerful outflows. We report observations taken with the Multi-Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer of NGC 1313 X--1 in order to confirm the presence of a
nebula inflated by the winds, investigate its main sources of ionisation and
estimate the mechanical output of the source. We detect a bubble of 452
$\times$ 266\,pc in size, roughly centred around the ULX, which shows clear
evidence for shock ionisation in the outer edges. We estimate shock velocities
to be in the $\approx160-180$\,km/s range based on the line ratios. This
suggests that an average and continuous outflow power of $\sim(2-4.5) \times
10^{40}$ erg/s over a timescale of $(4.5-7.8) \times10^5$\,yr is required to
inflate the bubble. In the interior of the bubble and closer to the ULX we
detect an extended ($\sim$140\,pc) X-ray ionised region. Additionally, we
detect two supernova remnants coincidentally close to the bubble of which we
also report age and explosion energy estimates. The elongated morphology and
the kinematics of the bubble strongly suggest that the bubble is being inflated
by winds and/or jets emanating from the central source, supporting the presence
of winds found through X-ray spectroscopy. The estimated mechanical power is
comparable or higher than the X-ray luminosity of the source, providing
additional evidence in support of NGC 1313 X--1 harbouring a super-Eddington
accretor.

Title:Large Impacts onto the Early Earth: Planetary Sterilization and Iron Delivery,"
Abstract:  Late accretion onto the Hadean Earth included large impacts that could have
influenced early habitability, either by sterilizing the planet or
alternatively catalyzing the origin of life by delivering iron required to
create a reducing environment/atmosphere. We present 3D numerical simulations
of 1500-3400 km diameter impacts on the early Earth in order to quantify their
effects on planetary habitability. We find sterilizing impact events require
larger projectiles than previously assumed, with a 2000-2700 km diameter
impactor required to completely melt Earth's surface and an extrapolated >700
km diameter impactor required for ocean-vaporization. We also find that
reducing environments are less likely to arise following large impacts than
previously suggested, because >70% of the projectile iron is deposited in the
crust and upper mantle where it is not immediately available to reduce surface
water and contribute to forming a reducing atmosphere. Although the largest
expected late accretion impacts (~1 lunar mass) delivered sufficient iron to
the atmosphere to have reduced an entire ocean mass of water, such impacts
would also have melted the entire surface, potentially sequestering condensing
iron that is not oxidized quickly. The hypothesis that life emerged in the
aftermath of large impacts requires an efficient mechanism of harnessing the
reducing power of iron sequestered in the crust/mantle, or an origin of life
pathway that operates in more weakly-reducing post-impact environments that
require smaller quantities of impact-delivered iron.

Title:A Comprehensive Study of the Spectral Variation and the Brightness Profile of Young Pulsar Wind Nebulae,"
Abstract:  We present a systematic study of particle transport by diffusion in young
pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). We selected nine bright sources that are well
resolved with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We analyzed archival data to
obtain their radial profiles of photon index ($\Gamma$) and surface brightness
($\Sigma$) in a consistent way. These profiles were then fit with a pure
diffusion model that was tested on Crab, 3C 58 and G21.5$-$0.9 before. In
addition to the spectral softening due to the diffusion, we calculated the
synchrotron power and built up the theoretical surface brightness profile. For
each source, we performed separate fits to the $\Gamma$ and the $\Sigma$
profiles. We found these two profiles of most PWNe are similar, except for Crab
and Vela. Both profiles can be well described by our model, suggesting that
diffusion dominates the particle transport in most sampled PWNe. The
discrepancy of parameters between the $\Gamma$ profile and $\Sigma$ profiles is
relatively large for 3C 58 and G54.1+0.3. This difference could be attributed
to the elongated shape, reflecting boundary, and the non-uniform magnetic
field. Finally, we found no significant correlations between diffusion
parameters and physical parameters of PWN and pulsar.

Title:A spatially dependent correction of Gaia EDR3 parallax zero-point offset based on 0.3 million LAMOST DR8 giant stars,"
Abstract:  We have studied the zero-point offset of Gaia early Data Release 3 (EDR3)
parallaxes based on a sample of 0.3 million giant stars built from the LAMOST
data with distance accuracy better than 8.5\%. The official parallax zero-point
corrections largely reduce the global offset in the Gaia EDR3 parallaxes: the
global parallax offsets are $-$27.9 $\mu$as and $-$26.5 $\mu$as (before
correction) and $+$2.6 $\mu$as and $+$2.9 $\mu$as (after correction) for the
five- and six-parameter solutions, respectively. The bias of the raw parallax
measurements is significantly dependent on the $G$ magnitudes, spectral colors,
and positions of stars. The official parallax zero-point corrections could
reduce parallax bias patterns with $G$ magnitudes, while could not fully
account the patterns in the spaces of the spectral colors and positions. In the
current paper, a spatially dependent parallax zero-point correction model for
Gaia EDR3 five-parameter solution in the LAMOST footprint is firstly provided
with the advantage of huge number of stars in our sample.

Abstract:  We present a value-added catalog containing stellar parameters estimated from
7.10 million low-resolution spectra for 5.16 million unique stars with spectral
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) higher than 10 obtained by the Large Sky Area
Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Galactic spectroscopic
surveys. The catalog presents values of stellar atmospheric parameters
(effective temperature $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, surface gravity $\log g$,
metallicity [Fe/H]/[M/H]), $\alpha$-element to metal abundance ratio
[$\alpha$/M], carbon and nitrogen to iron abundance ratios [C/Fe] and [N/Fe]
and 14 bands' absolute magnitudes deduced from LAMOST spectra using the method
of neural network. The spectro-photometric distances of those stars are also
provided based on the distance modulus. For stars with spectral SNRs larger
than 50, precisions of $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], [M/H], [C/Fe],
[N/Fe] and [$\alpha$/M] are 85\,K, 0.098\,dex, 0.05\,dex, 0.05\,dex,
0.052\,dex, 0.082\,dex and 0.027\,dex, respectively. The errors of 14 band's
absolute magnitudes are 0.16--0.22\,mag for stars with spectral SNRs larger
than 50. The spectro-photometric distance is accurate to 8.5\% for stars with
spectral SNRs larger than 50, and is more accurate than geometrical distance
for stars with distance larger than 2.0\,kpc. Our estimates of [Fe/H] are
reliable down to [Fe/H] $\sim -3.5$\,dex, significantly better than previous
results. The catalog provide 26,868 unique very metal poor star candidates
([Fe/H] $\leq -2.0$). The catalog would be a valuable data set to study the

Title:Dippers from TESS Full-frame Images. II. Spectroscopic Characterization of Four Young Dippers,"
Abstract:  Photometric monitoring by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
has discovered not only periodic signals by transiting exoplanets but also
episodic or quasi-periodic dimming around young stellar objects. The mechanisms
of the dimming of these objects, so-called ""dippers"", are thought to be related
to the property of the accretion or the structure of protoplanetary disks
especially in regions close to the host star. Recently, we have created the
catalog of dippers from the one year of TESS Full Frame Image (FFI) data. In
this paper, we report spectral features of four newly found dippers in that
catalog and show that they potentially shed light on the dimming mechanisms. We
found that all of the targets exhibit the H alpha emission line, which is an
indicator of an ongoing accretion. Based on its line profiles and/or their
variability, we characterized the properties of the disks of each source, which
can support the dimming mechanisms due to a dusty disk wind or an accretion
warp. Also, we found an interesting dipper (TIC 317873721), ""close-in binary
dipper,"" showing the complex variability of the line profile and the large
radial velocity variation. Since the dimming intervals are similar to the
orbital period of the binary, we suggest that the dips are caused by dust in
the warp of accretion from a circumbinary disk onto stars. Such a close-in ($<$
0.1 au) binary dipper is rarely reported so far, further investigation will
reveal the new aspect of the disk evolution and planetary formation.

Title:Constraining the baryon loading factor of AGN jets: implication from the gamma-ray emission of the Coma cluster,"
Abstract:  High-energy cosmic rays (CRs) can be accelerated in the relativistic jets of
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) powered by supermassive black holes. The baryon
loading efficiency onto relativistic CR baryons from the accreting black holes
is poorly constrained by observations so far. In this paper, we suggest that
the $\gamma$-ray emission of galaxy clusters can be used to study the baryon
loading factor of AGN jets, since CRs injected by AGN jets are completely
confined in the galaxy clusters and sufficiently interact with intra-cluster
medium via hadronic process, producing diffuse $\gamma$-rays. We study the
propagation of CRs in the galaxy clusters and calculate the radial distribution
of the gamma-rays in the galaxy cluster with different injection rates from
AGNs. By comparison with the $\gamma$-ray flux and upper limits of the Coma
cluster measured by $Fermi$-LAT and VERITAS, we find the upper limit of the
average baryon loading factor {(defined as the efficiency with which the
gravitational energy is converted into relativistic particles)} to be $\eta_{p,
\mathrm{grav}} < 0.1$. The upper limit is much lower than that required to
account for diffuse neutrino flux in the conventional blazar models.

Title:Optimizing Gravitational-Wave Detector Design for Squeezed Light,"
Abstract:  Achieving the quantum noise targets of third-generation detectors will
require 10 dB of squeezed-light enhancement as well as megawatt laser power in
the interferometer arms - both of which require unprecedented control of the
internal optical losses. In this work, we present a novel optimization approach
to gravitational-wave detector design aimed at maximizing the robustness to
common, yet unavoidable, optical fabrication and installation errors, which
have caused significant loss in Advanced LIGO. As a proof of concept, we employ
these techniques to perform a two-part optimization of the LIGO A+ design.
First, we optimize the arm cavities for reduced scattering loss in the presence
of point absorbers, as currently limit the operating power of Advanced LIGO.
Then, we optimize the signal recycling cavity for maximum squeezing
performance, accounting for realistic errors in the positions and radii of
curvature of the optics. Our findings suggest that these techniques can be
leveraged to achieve substantially greater quantum noise performance in current
and future gravitational-wave detectors.

Title:Tracking Halo Orbits and Their Mass Evolution around Large-scale Filaments,"
Abstract:  We have explored the dynamical and mass evolution of halos driven by
large-scale filaments using a dark matter-only cosmological simulation with the
help of a phase-space analysis. Since a non-negligible number of galaxies is
expected to fall into the cluster environment through large-scale filaments,
tracking how halos move around large-scale filaments can provide a more
comprehensive view on the evolution of cluster galaxies. Halos exhibit orbital
motions around filaments, which emerge as specific trajectories in a phase
space composed of halos' perpendicular distance and velocity component with
respect to filaments. These phase-space trajectories can be represented by
three cases according to their current states. We parameterize the trajectories
with halos' initial position and velocity, maximum velocity, formation time,
and time since first crossing, which are found to be correlated with each
other. These correlations are explained well in the context of the large-scale
structure formation. The mass evolution and dynamical properties of halos seem
to be affected by the density of filaments, which can be shown from the fact
that halos around denser filaments are more likely to lose their mass and be
bound within large-scale filaments. Finally we reproduce the mass segregation
trend around filaments found in observations. It is resulted because halos that
formed earlier arrived filaments earlier, and grew efficiently there being more
massive. We also found that dynamical friction helps to retain this segregation
trend.

Title:A Channel to Form Fast-spinning Black Hole--Neutron Star Binary Mergers as Multi-messenger Sources,"
Abstract:  After the successful detection of a gravitational-wave (GW) signal and its
associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts from GW170817, neutron star--black
hole (NSBH) mergers have been highly expected to be the next type of
multi-messenger source. However, despite the detection of several of NSBH
merger candidates during the GW third observation run, no confirmed EM
counterparts from these sources have been identified. The most plausible
explanation is that these NSBH merger candidates were plunging events mainly
because the primary BHs had near-zero projected aligned-spins based on GW
observations. In view that NSs can be easily tidally disrupted by BHs with high
projected aligned-spins, we study an evolution channel to form NSBH binaries
with fast-spinning BHs, the properties of BH mass and spin, and their
associated tidal disruption probability. We find that if the NSs are born
firstly, the companion helium stars would be tidally spun up efficiently, and
would thus finally form fast-spinning BHs. If BHs do not receive significant
natal kicks at birth, these NSBH binaries that can merge within the Hubble time
would have BHs with the projected aligned-spins $\chi_{z}\gtrsim0.8$ and,
hence, can certainly allow tidal disruption to happen. Even if significant BH
kicks are considered for a small fraction of NSBH binaries, the projected
aligned-spins of BHs are $\chi_z\gtrsim0.2$. These systems can still be
disrupted events unless the NSs are very massive. Thus, NS-first-born NSBH
mergers would be promising multi-messenger sources. We discuss various
potential EM counterparts associated with these systems and their detectability
in the upcoming fourth observation run.

Abstract:  The paper presents a correction to the scaling relations for red-giant stars
using model-based masses and radii. We measure radial-mode frequencies from
Kepler observations for 3,642 solar-like oscillators on the red-giant branch
and use them to characterise the stars with the grid-based modeling. We
determine fundamental stellar parameters with good precision: the typical
uncertainty is 4.5% for mass, 16% for age, 0.006 dex for surface gravity, and
1.7% for radius. We also achieve good accuracy for estimated masses and radii,
based on comparing with those determined for eclipsing binaries. We find a
systematic offset of ~15% in mass and ~7% in radius between the modeling
solutions and the scaling relations. Further investigation indicates that these
offsets are mainly caused by a systematic bias in the Delta nu scaling
relation: the original scaling relation underestimates Delta nu value by ~4%,
on average, and it is important to correct for the surface term in the
calibration. We find no significant offset in the nu_max scaling relation,
although a clear metallicity dependence is seen and we suggest including a
metallicity term in the formulae. Lastly, we calibrate new scaling relations
for red-giant stars based on observed global seismic parameters, spectroscopic
effective temperatures and metallicities, and modeling-inferred masses and
radii.

Abstract:  The pulsations of X-ray pulsars carry information about the accretion and

resolved pulse profiles of a sample of X-ray pulsars, focusing on high-mass
X-ray binaries. Our goal is to perform a classification of X-ray pulsars based
on their observed pulse profiles and look for correlations between this
classification and their principle physical observables. The analysis pipeline
is available online. We analysed the pulse profiles of a sample of X-ray
pulsars using data obtained with the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. We fit the energy
resolved pulse profiles with a Fourier series of up to five harmonics. We
investigate relationships between the pulse profile properties and other
observables of the systems (e.g., orbital period, magnetic field strength, and
luminosity) to study the extreme physics of these systems. The sources were
divided into three groups by a classification based on the shape, the dominance
of the fitted Fourier harmonics and their respective evolution with energy. We
do not find a conclusive correlation between the pulse profile shapes or groups
and other parameters of the systems. However, a weak trend was found when
comparing our classification to the sources' location in the spin
period-orbital period diagram. Further studies are required to confirm this
trend. Despite the large variety of pulse profiles of the X-ray pulsars, we
found that with our approach clear categories emerge which we use to classify
their behavior as function of energy. As we do not find a clear relationship
between our classification scheme and other parameters we conclude that X-ray
pulse profiles are influenced by other hidden variables.

Title:Methane-saturated layers limit the observability of impact craters on Titan,"
Abstract:  As the only icy satellite with a thick atmosphere and liquids on its surface,
Titan represents a unique end-member to study the impact cratering process.
Unlike craters on other Saturnian satellites, Titan's craters are
preferentially located in high-elevation regions near the equator. This led to
the hypothesis that the presence of liquid methane in Titan's lowlands affects
crater morphology, making them difficult to identify. This is because surfaces
covered by weak fluid-saturated sediment limit the topographic expression of
impact craters, as sediment moves into the crater cavity shortly after
formation. Here we simulate crater-forming impacts on Titan's surface,
exploring how a methane-saturated layer overlying a methane-clathrate layer
affects crater formation. Our numerical results show that impacts form smaller
craters in a methane-clathrate basement than a water-ice basement, due to the
differences in strength. We find that the addition of a methane-saturated layer
atop this basement reduces crater depths and influences crater morphology. The
morphology of impact craters formed in a thin methane-saturated layer are
similar to those in a ""dry"" target, but a thick saturated layer produces an
impact structure with little to no topography. A thick methane-saturated layer
(thicker than 40% of the impactor diameter) could explain the dearth of craters
in the low-elevation regions on Titan.

Title:Testing particle acceleration models for BL LAC jets with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer,"
Abstract:  To determine if the recently launched Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer
(IXPE) can follow the polarization variations induced by different particle
acceleration mechanisms in blazars jets we simulate observations of a high
synchrotron peak (HSP) blazar variable in polarization degree and angle
according to the theoretical predictions of Tavecchio et al., 2020 (shock
acceleration model), Bodo et al., 2021 (magnetic reconnection model) and
Marscher \& Jorstad, 2021 (Turbulent Extreme Multi-Zone Model). We use the
Monte Carlo tool ixpeobssim to create realistic IXPE data products. We create
simulated light-curves of polarization degree and angle by time-slicing the
simulated data into arbitrary short time bins. We use a $\chi^2$ test to assess
the performance of the observations in detecting the time variability of the
polarization properties. A series of 10 ks long observations permits IXPE to
follow the time variability of the polarization degree in the case of the shock
acceleration model. In the case of the magnetic reconnection model, the nominal
injected model provides the best fit of the simulated IXPE data for time bins
of 5-10 ks, depending on the tested flux level. For the TEMZ model, shorter
time slices of 0.5 ks are needed for obtaining a formally good fit of the
simulated IXPE data with the injected model. On the other hand, we find that a
fit with a constant model provides a $\chi^2$ lower than the fit with the
nominal injected model when using time slices of 20 ks, 60/70 ks, and 5 ks for
the case of the shock acceleration, magnetic reconnection and TEMZ model,
respectively. We conclude that, provided that the statistics of the observation
allows slicing of the data in adequately short time bins, IXPE observations of
an HSP blazar at a typical flux level can detect the time variability predicted
by popular models for particle acceleration in jets.

Title:3D hydrodynamical simulations of the impact of mechanical feedback on accretion in supersonic stellar-mass black holes,"
Abstract:  Isolated stellar-mass BH accrete gas, often at supersonic speeds, and can
form outflows that can influence the accreted gas. The latter process, known as
mechanical feedback, can significantly affect the accretion rate. We use
hydrodynamical simulations to assess the impact of mechanical feedback on the
accretion rate when the BH moves supersonically through a uniform medium. We
carry out 3D hydrodynamical simulations of outflows fueled by accretion that
interact with a uniform medium, probing scales similar to and larger than the
accretor gravitational sphere of influence. In the simulations the accretor is
at rest and the medium moves at supersonic speeds. The outflow power is assumed
to be proportional to the accretion rate. The simulations are run for different
outflow-medium motion angles and velocity ratios. The impact of different
degrees of outflow collimation, accretor size, and resolution is also
investigated. In general, the accretion rate is significantly affected by
mechanical feedback. The effect is small for outflows perpendicular to the
medium motion, and quickly grows for smaller angles. Moreover, the smaller the
medium-to-outflow velocity ratio is, the more accretion decreases. On the other
hand, the impact of outflow collimation seems moderate. The effect is enhanced
when the accretor size is reduced. For a population of BH with random outflow
orientations, the average accretion rate drops by (high-low resolution)
~0.2-0.4 and ~0.1-0.2 for medium-to-outflow velocity ratios of 1/20 and 1/100,
respectively, when compared to the corresponding cases without outflow. Our
results strongly indicate that, on the considered scales, mechanical feedback
can easily reduce the energy available from supersonic accretion by a factor of
several. This should be taken into account when studying the mechanical,
thermal and non-thermal output of isolated BH.

Abstract:  Galaxy clusters (GCs) are the largest and most massive gravitationally bound
objects in the large-scale structure of the Universe. Due to keV temperatures
of virialized gas in the intracluster medium (ICM) and presence of cosmic rays
(CRs), GCs are effective sources of thermal X-ray radiation and non-thermal
leptonic (synchrotron) radio emission. GCs are also store-rooms for hadronic
CRs, but non-thermal hadronic gamma-ray emission (mainly, due to pp collisions
and subsequent pion decay) from GCs has not been detected yet. In this work we
simulate the expected non-thermal hadronic gamma-ray and neutrino emission from
dominant part of Hercules cluster - GC A2151 - and estimate a perspective of
detection of this emission by existing (Fermi-LAT, LHASSO, IceCube) and planned
(CTA, IceCube-Gen2) ground-based ans space-based detectors.

Title:The Stability of the Electron Strahl against the Oblique Fast-magnetosonic/Whistler Instability in the Inner Heliosphere,"
Abstract:  We analyze the micro-kinetic stability of the electron strahl in the solar
wind depending on heliocentric distance. The oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler
(FM/W) instability has emerged in the literature as a key candidate mechanism
for the effective scattering of the electron strahl into the electron halo
population. Using data from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Helios, we compare the
measured strahl properties with the analytical thresholds for the oblique FM/W
instability in the low- and high-$\beta_{\parallel c}$ regimes, where
$\beta_{\parallel c}$ is the ratio of the core parallel thermal pressure to the
magnetic pressure. Our PSP and Helios data show that the electron strahl is on
average stable against the oblique FM/W instability in the inner heliosphere.
Our analysis suggests that the instability, if at all, can only be excited
sporadically and on short timescales. We discuss the caveats of our analysis
and potential alternative explanations for the observed scattering of the
electron strahl in the solar wind. Furthermore, we recommend the numerical
evaluation of the stability of individual distributions in the future to
account for any uncertainties in the validity of the analytical expressions for
the instability thresholds.

Title:Searching for Anomalous Microwave Emission in nearby galaxies. K-band observations with the Sardinia Radio Telescope,"
Abstract:  We observed four nearby spiral galaxies (NGC 3627, NGC 4254, NGC 4736 and NGC
5055) in the K band with the 64-m Sardinia Radio Telescope, with the aim of
detecting the Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME), a radiation component
presumably due to spinning dust grains, observed so far in the Milky Way and in
a handful of other galaxies only (most notably, M 31). We mapped the galaxies
at 18.6 and 24.6 GHz and studied their global photometry together with other
radio-continuum data from the literature, in order to find AME as emission in
excess of the synchrotron and thermal components. We only find upper limits for
AME. These non-detections, and other upper limits in the literature, are
nevertheless consistent with the average AME emissivity from the few
detections: it is $\epsilon^\mathrm{AME}_{\mathrm{30~GHz}} = 2.4\pm0.4 \times
10^{-2}$ MJy sr$^{-1}$ (M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$)$^{-1}$ in units of dust surface
density (equivalently, $1.4\pm0.2 \times 10^{-18}$ Jy sr$^{-1}$ (H
cm$^{-2}$)$^{-1}$ in units of H column density). We finally suggest to search
for AME in quiescent spirals with relatively low radio luminosity, such as
M~31.

Title:Analytic modeling of recurrent Forbush decreases caused by corotating interaction regions,"
Abstract:  On scales of days, the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux is affected by coronal
mass ejections and corotating interaction regions (CIRs), causing so-called
Forbush decreases and recurrent Forbush decreases (RFDs), respectively. We
explain the properties and behavior of RFDs recorded at about 1 au that are
caused by CIRs generated by solar wind high-speed streams (HSSs) that emanate
from coronal holes. We employed a convection-diffusion GCR propagation model
based on the Fokker-Planck equation and applied it to solar wind and
interplanetary magnetic field properties at 1 au. Our analysis shows that the
only two effects that are relevant for a plausible overall explanation of the
observations are the enhanced convection effect caused by the increased
velocity of the HSS and the reduced diffusion effect caused by the enhanced
magnetic field and its fluctuations within the CIR and HSS structure. These two
effects that we considered in the model are sufficient to explain not only the
main signatures of RFDs, but also the sometimes observed ""over-recovery"" and
secondary dips in RFD profiles. The explanation in terms of the
convection-diffusion GCR propagation hypothesis is tested by applying our model
to the observations of a long-lived CIR that recurred over 27 rotations in
2007-2008. Our analysis demonstrates a very good match of the model results and
observations.

Title:Generic profile of a long-lived corotating interaction region and associated recurrent Forbush decrease,"
Abstract:  We observe and analyse a long-lived corotating interaction region (CIR),
originating from a single coronal hole (CH), recurring in 27 consecutive
Carrington rotations 2057-2083 in the time period from June 2007 - May 2009. We
studied the in situ measurements of this long-lived CIR as well as the
corresponding depression in the cosmic ray (CR) count observed by SOHO/EPHIN
throughout different rotations. We performed a statistical analysis, as well as
the superposed epoch analysis, using relative values of the key parameters: the
total magnetic field strength, B, the magnetic field fluctuations, dBrms,
plasma flow speed, v, plasma density, n, plasma temperature, T , and the
SOHO/EPHIN F-detector particle count, and CR count. We find that the mirrored
CR count-time profile is correlated with that of the flow speed, ranging from
moderate to strong correlation, depending on the rotation. In addition, we find
that the CR count dip amplitude is correlated to the peak in the magnetic field
and flow speed of the CIR. These results are in agreement with previous
statistical studies. Finally, using the superposed epoch analysis, we obtain a
generic CIR example, which reflects the in situ properties of a typical CIR
well. Our results are better explained based on the combined
convection-diffusion approach of the CIR-related GCR modulation. Furthermore,
qualitatively, our results do not differ from those based on different CHs
samples. This indicates that the change of the physical properties of the
recurring CIR from one rotation to another is not qualitatively different from
the change of the physical properties of CIRs originating from different CHs.
Finally, the obtained generic CIR example, analyzed on the basis of superposed
epoch analysis, can be used as a reference for testing future models.

Title:The merging galaxy cluster Abell 3266 at low radio frequencies,"
Abstract:  We present new low-frequency ($\nu = 88$-216 MHz) observations of the complex
merging galaxy cluster Abell 3266. These new observations are taken with the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in its Phase II 'extended', long-baseline
configuration, offering the highest-resolution low-frequency view of the
cluster to date. We report on the detection of four steep spectrum ($\alpha
\lesssim -1$ for $S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$) extended radio sources within the
cluster. We confirm the detection of a $\sim 570$ kpc radio relic to the south
of the cluster, and a possible bridge of emission connecting the relic to the
cluster core. We also detect two new ultra-steep-spectrum ($\alpha \lesssim
-1.7$) fossil plasma sources to the north and west of the cluster centre
without associated compact radio emission. A previously detected radio galaxy
in the cluster is also found to have a spectrally steepening tail with
steep-spectrum components highlighted by the MWA. We do not detect a giant
radio halo in the cluster. After simulating a range of radio haloes at 216 MHz
we place upper limits on the radio luminosity corresponding to $\sim 7.2 \times
10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 150 MHz assuming the expected 500 kpc radius, up to a
factor 5 lower than expected from scaling relations. Why a giant radio halo is
undetected in Abell 3266 is unclear - the timeline of the merger and overall
mass of the system as determined by optical and X-ray studies suggest the
foundation for a hosting system.

Title:Probing infrared excess connection with Li enhancement among red clump giants,"
Abstract:  We have performed a search among low mass red giants for finding evidence for
merger scenario for triggering He-flash and subsequent Li enhancement. We chose
a sample of red giants from GALAH survey with well-measured Li abundances, and
near and mid-IR fluxes from 2MASS and WISE surveys, respectively. The sample
contains 418 cool red clump giants and 359 upper red giant branch giants. Most
of the giants and majority of super Li-rich giants show no IR excess. Only five
red clump giants and one RGB giant show IR excess. Notably, of the five red
clump giants with IR excess, three are super Li-rich (A(Li) > = 3.2 dex), and
two are Li-rich (A(Li) > = 1.0 dex). Results suggest Li enhancement among red
clump giants may be due to two channels: one resulting from in-situ He-flash in
single star evolution and the other due to He-flash triggered by events like
merger of He-white dwarfs with giants He-inert core on RGB. In the latter case,
IR excess, as a result of mass loss, is expected from merger events. We have
modelled IR excess in all six giants using DUSTY code and derived dust
parameters. The estimated kinematic ages and time scales of dust envelopes of
the super Li-rich phase suggest Li enhancement took place very recently.
Further, the analysis shows a significantly higher proportion (four out of five
red clump giants) of rapid rotators (vsini > = 8 km/s) among Li-rich giants
with IR excess compared to Li-normal and Li-rich giants with no IR excess.

Title:Constraining galaxy overdensities around three z~6.5 quasars with ALMA and MUSE,"
Abstract:  We quantify galaxy overdensities around three high-redshift quasars with
known [CII] 158um companions: PJ231-20 (z=6.59), PJ308-21 (z=6.24) and
J0305-3150 (z=6.61). Recent SCUBA2 imaging revealed the presence of 17
submillimeter galaxies (SMG) with sky separations $0.7'< \theta < 2.4'$ from
these three quasars. We present ALMA Band 6 follow-up observations of these
SCUBA2-selected SMGs to confirm their nature and redshift. We also search for
continuum-undetected [CII] emitters in the ALMA pointings and make use of
archival MUSE observations to search for Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitters (LAE)
associated with the quasars. While most of the SCUBA2-selected sources are
detected with ALMA in the continuum, no [CII] line emission could be detected,
indicating that they are not at the quasar redshifts. Based on the
serendipitous detection of CO 7-6 and [CI] emission lines, we find that four
SMGs in the field of PJ231-20 are at z~2.4, which is coincident with the
redshift of a Mg II absorber in the quasar rest-frame UV spectrum. We report
the discovery of 2 LAEs within <0.6 cMpc of PJ231-20 at the same redshift,
indicating a LAE overdensity around this quasar. Taken together, these
observations provide new constraints on the large-scale excess of
Lyman-$\alpha$- and [CII]-emitting galaxies around z>6 quasars and suggest that
only wide-field observations, such as MUSE, ALMA or JWST mosaics, can reveal a
comprehensive picture of large-scale structure around quasars in the first
billion years of the Universe.

Title:Mid-infrared Variability of Low-redshift Active Galactic Nuclei : Constraints on a Hot Dust Component with a Variable Covering Factor,"
Abstract:  We utilize mid-infrared multi-epoch data from Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer (WISE) over a $\sim10$-year period in W1 (3.4$\mu$m) and W2
(4.6$\mu$m) bands to investigate the structure of dusty torus in low-redshift
($0.15<z\le 0.4$) active galactic nuclei (AGN). We calculate a Spearman
correlation coefficient ($r_{12}$) between W1 magnitude and W1$-$W2 color based
on the light curve in individual objects. Interestingly, $r_{12}$ spans a broad
range from $-1$ to $1$, and is detected to be correlated with mean W1$-$W2
color and AGN bolometric luminosity, in the sense that objects with blue
W1$-$W2 color and low AGN luminosity tend to become redder (bluer) with
increasing (decreasing) W1 brightness in the light curve (i.e. $r_{12} < 0$),
although the correlation of $r_{12}$ with the bolometric luminosity is
relatively weak. The fit for the spectral energy distribution reveals a
significant contribution from the host galaxy in the W1 and W2 bands. However,
the dependencies of $r_{12}$ on W1$-$W2 color and AGN luminosity still persist
even after careful elimination of the host light contribution. We propose that
this result can be explained if covering factor of the hot dust component
decreases as AGN luminosity increases.

Title:Tidal stripping of dark matter subhalos by baryons from analytical perspectives: disk shocking and encounters with stars,"
Abstract:  The cold dark matter (CDM) scenario predicts that galactic halos should host
a huge amount of subhalos possibly lighter than planets, depending on the
nature of dark matter. Predicting their abundance and distribution has
important implications for dark matter searches and searches for subhalos
themselves, as they could provide a decisive test of the CDM paradigm. A major
difficulty in subhalo population model building is to account for the
gravitational stripping induced by baryons, which strongly impact on the
overall dynamics inside galaxies. In this paper, we focus on these ""baryonic""
tides from analytical perspectives, summarizing previous work on galactic disk
shocking, and thoroughly revisiting the impact of individual encounters with
stars. For the latter, we go beyond the reference calculation of Gerhard and
Fall (1983) to deal with penetrative encounters, and provide new analytical
results. Based upon a full statistical analysis of subhalo energy change during
multiple stellar encounters possibly occurring during disk crossing, we show
that subhalos lighter than $\sim 1$~M$_\odot$ are very efficiently pruned by
stellar encounters. This modifies their mass function in a stellar environment.
In contrast, disk shocking is more efficient at pruning massive subhalos. In
short, if reasonably resilient, subhalos surviving disk crossing have lost all
their mass but an inner cuspy part, with a tidal mass function strongly
departing from the cosmological one. If fragile, stellar encounters make their
number density drop by an additional order of magnitude with respect to
disk-shocking effects only (e.g., at the solar position in the Milky Way). Our
results can be incorporated to any analytical or numerical subhalo population
model, as we show for illustration. This study complements those based on
cosmological simulations, which cannot resolve dark matter subhalos on such
small scales.

Title:Inhomogeneous Jets from Neutron Star Mergers: One Jet to Rule them all,"
Abstract:  The broad, $\sim 4$ order of magnitude range in energy, inferred via
afterglow observations, for the short Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) population is
difficult to reconcile with the narrow energy distribution expected from
neutron star merger progenitors. Using the resultant profiles from 3D
hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic jets interacting with neutron star
merger wind ejecta, we show how the inhomogeneity of energy and velocity can
alter the observed afterglow lightcurve. From a single jet we find that the
peak afterglow flux depends sensitively on the observer's line-of-sight: at an
inclination within the GRB emitting region we find peak flux variability on the
order $<0.5$ dex through rotational orientation, and $<1.3$ dex for polar
inclination. The inferred jet kinetic energy for a fixed parameter afterglow
covers $\sim 1/3$ of the observed short GRB population. We find a physically
motivated, analytic jet structure function via our simulations and include an
approximation for the varying collimation due to the merger ejecta mass. We
show that by considering the observed range of merger ejecta masses, a short
GRB jet population with a single intrinsic energy is capable of explaining the
observed broad diversity in short GRB kinetic energies.

Title:ExoCAM: A 3D Climate Model for Exoplanet Atmospheres,"
Abstract:  The TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI) project was
initiated to compare 3D climate models that are commonly used for predicting
theoretical climates of habitable zone extrasolar planets. One of the core
models studied as part of THAI is ExoCAM, an independently curated exoplanet
branch of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth
System Model (CESM) version 1.2.1. ExoCAM has been used for studying
atmospheres of terrestrial extrasolar planets around a variety of stars. To
accompany the THAI project and provide a primary reference, here we describe
ExoCAM and what makes it unique from standard configurations of CESM.
Furthermore, we also conduct a series of intramodel sensitivity tests of
relevant moist physical tuning parameters while using the THAI protocol as our
starting point. A common criticism of 3D climate models used for exoplanet
modeling is that cloud and convection routines often contain free parameters
that are tuned to the modern Earth, and thus may be a source of uncertainty in
evaluating exoplanet climates. Here, we explore sensitivities to numerous
configuration and parameter selections, including a recently updated radiation
scheme, a different cloud and convection physics package, different cloud and
precipitation tuning parameters, and a different sea ice albedo. Improvements
to our radiation scheme and the modification of cloud particle sizes have the
largest effect on global mean temperatures, with variations up to ~10 K,
highlighting the requirement for accurate radiative transfer and the importance
of cloud microphysics for simulating exoplanetary climates. However for the
vast majority of sensitivity tests, climate differences are small. For all
cases studied, intramodel differences do not bias general conclusions regarding
climate states and habitability.

Title:Estimates of the change rate of solar mass and gravitational constant based on the dynamics of the Solar System,"
Abstract:  The estimate of the change rate of the solar gravitational parameter
$\mathrm{d}(GM_{\odot})/\mathrm{d}t$ is obtained from processing modern
positional observations of planets and spacecraft. Observations were processed
and parameters were determined basing on the numerical planetary ephemeris
EPM2019. The obtained annual decrease in solar mass $M_{\odot}$ accounts for
the loss through radiation ${\dot M}_{{\odot}\mathrm{rad}}$, through the
outgoing solar wind ${\dot M}_{{\odot}{\mathrm{wind}}}$, and for the material
falling on the Sun ${\dot M}_{{\odot}\mathrm{fall}}$. The estimated relative
value is within $-13.4\cdot 10^{-14} < (\dot M_{\odot}
/M_{\odot})_{\mathrm{rad}+\mathrm{wind}+ \mathrm{fall}} < -8.7\cdot 10^{-14}$
per year. The following range for the change rate of the gravitational constant
$G$ was obtained: $-2.9 \cdot 10^{-14} < \dot G /G < + 4.6 \cdot 10^{-14}$ per
year $(3\sigma$). The new result reduces the interval for the change in $G$ and
narrows the limits of possible deviations for alternative gravitational
theories from general relativity.

"Title:Dark Matter Halos in Interacting Dark Energy Models: Formation History, Density Profile, Spin and Shape","
Abstract:  The interacting dark energy (IDE) model, which considers the interaction
between dark energy and dark matter, provides a natural mechanism to alleviate
the coincidence problem and can also relieve the observational tensions under
the $\Lambda$CDM model. Previous studies have put constraints on IDE models by
observations of cosmic expansion history, cosmic microwave background and
large-scale structures. However, these data are not yet enough to distinguish
IDE models from $\Lambda$CDM effectively. Because the non-linear structure
formation contains rich cosmological information, it can provide additional
means to differentiate alternative models. In this paper, based on a set of
$N$-body simulations for IDE models, we investigate the formation histories and
properties of dark matter halos, and compare with their $\Lambda$CDM
counterparts. For the model with dark matter decaying into dark energy and the
parameters being the best-fit values from previous constraints, the structure
formation is markedly slowed down, and the halos have systematically lower
mass, looser internal structure, higher spin and anisotropy. This is
inconsistent with the observed structure formation, and thus this model can be
safely ruled out from the perspective of non-linear structure formation.
Moreover, we find that the ratio of halo concentrations between IDE and
$\Lambda$CDM counterparts depends sensitively on the interaction parameter and
is independent of halo mass. This can act as a powerful probe to constrain IDE
models. Our results concretely demonstrate that the interaction of the two dark
components can affect the halo formation considerably, and therefore the
constraints from non-linear structures are indispensable.

Title:Tidal disruption of star clusters in galaxy formation simulations,"
Abstract:  We investigate the evolution of the tidal field experienced by massive star
clusters using cosmological simulations of Milky Way-sized galaxies. Clusters
in our simulations experience the strongest tidal force in the first few
hundred Myr after formation, when the maximum eigenvalue of the tidal tensor
reaches several times $10^4$ Gyr$^{-2}$. After about 1 Gyr the tidal field
plateaus at a lower value, with the median $\lambda_{\rm m} \sim 3 \times 10^3$
Gyr$^{-2}$. The fraction of time clusters spend in high tidal strength
($\lambda_{\rm m} > 3 \times 10^4$ Gyr$^{-2}$) regions also decreases with
their age from $\sim$20% immediately after formation to less than 1% after 1
Gyr. At early ages both the in situ and ex situ clusters experience similar
tidal fields, while at older ages the in situ clusters in general experience
stronger tidal field due to their lower orbits in host galaxy. This difference
is reflected in the survival of clusters: we looked into cluster disruption
calculated in simulation runtime and found that ex situ star clusters of the
same initial mass typically end up with higher bound fraction at the last
available simulation snapshot than the in situ ones.

Title:On the evolution of the Hubble constant with the SNe Ia Pantheon Sample and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations: a feasibility study for GRB-cosmology in 2030,"
Abstract:  The difference from 4 to 6 $\sigma$ in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) between
the values observed with the local (Cepheids and Supernovae Ia, SNe Ia) and the
high-z probes (CMB obtained by the Planck data) still challenges the
astrophysics and cosmology community. Previous analysis has shown that there is
an evolution in the Hubble constant that scales as
$f(z)=\mathcal{H}_{0}/(1+z)^{\eta}$, where $\mathcal{H}_0$ is $H_{0}(z=0)$ and
$\eta$ is the evolutionary parameter. Here, we investigate if this evolution
still holds by using the SNe Ia gathered in the Pantheon sample and the BAOs.
We assume $H_{0}=70 \textrm{km s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ as the local value and
divide the Pantheon into 3 bins ordered in increasing values of redshift.
Similar to our previous analysis but varying two cosmological parameters
contemporaneously ($H_0$, $\Omega_{0m}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model and $H_0$,
$w_a$ in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model), for each bin we implement a MCMC analysis
obtaining the value of $H_0$ $[...]$. Subsequently, the values of $H_0$ are
fitted with the model $f(z)$. Our results show that a decreasing trend with
$\eta \sim10^{-2}$ is still visible in this sample. The $\eta$ coefficient
reaches zero in 2.0 $\sigma$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model up to 5.8 $\sigma$ for
$w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model. This trend, if not due to statistical fluctuations,
could be explained through a hidden astrophysical bias, such as the effect of
stretch evolution, or it requires new theoretical models, a possible
proposition is the modified gravity theories, $f(R)$ $[...]$. This work is also
a preparatory to understand how the combined probes still show an evolution of
the $H_0$ by redshift and what is the current status of simulations on GRB
cosmology to obtain the uncertainties on the $\Omega_{0m}$ comparable with the
ones achieved through SNe Ia.

Title:The black hole population in low-mass galaxies in large-scale cosmological simulations,"
Abstract:  Recent systematic searches for massive black holes (BHs) in local dwarf
galaxies led to the discovery of a population of faint Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN). We investigate the agreement of the BH and AGN populations in the
Illustris, TNG, Horizon-AGN, EAGLE, and SIMBA simulations with current
observational constraints in low-mass galaxies. We find that some of these
simulations produce BHs that are too massive, and that the BH occupation
fraction at z=0 is not inherited from the simulation seeding modeling. The
ability of BHs and their host galaxies to power an AGN depends on BH and galaxy
subgrid modeling. The fraction of AGN in low-mass galaxies is not used to
calibrate the simulations, and thus can be used to differentiate galaxy
formation models. AGN fractions at z=0 span two orders of magnitude at fixed
galaxy stellar mass in simulations, similarly to observational constraints, but
uncertainties and degeneracies affect both observations and simulations. The
agreement is difficult to interpret due to differences in the masses of
simulated and observed BHs, BH occupation fraction affected by numerical
choices, and an unknown fraction of obscured AGN. Our work advocates for more
thorough comparisons with observations to improve the modeling of cosmological
simulations, and our understanding of BH and galaxy physics in the low-mass
regime. The mass of BHs, their ability to efficiently accrete gas, and the AGN
fraction in low-mass galaxies have important implications for the build-up of
the entire BH and galaxy populations with time.

Title:The Maximum Mass-Loss Efficiency for a Photoionization-Driven Isothermal Parker Wind,"
Abstract:  Observations of present-day mass-loss rates for close-in transiting
exoplanets provide a crucial check on models of planetary evolution. One common
approach is to model the planetary absorption signal during the transit in
lines like He I 10830 with an isothermal Parker wind, but this leads to a
degeneracy between the assumed outflow temperature $T_0$ and the mass-loss rate
$\dot{M}$ that can span orders of magnitude in $\dot{M}$. In this study, we
re-examine the isothermal Parker wind model using an energy-limited framework.
We show that in cases where photoionization is the only heat source, there is a
physical upper limit to the efficiency parameter $\varepsilon$ corresponding to
the maximal amount of heating. This allows us to rule out a subset of winds
with high temperatures and large mass-loss rates as they do not generate enough
heat to remain self-consistent. To demonstrate the utility of this framework,
we consider spectrally unresolved metastable helium observations of HAT-P-11b,
WASP-69b, and HAT-P-18b. For the former two planets, we find that only
relatively weak ($\dot{M}\lesssim 10^{11.5}$ g s$^{-1}$) outflows can match the
metastable helium observations while remaining energetically self-consistent,
while for HAT-P-18b all of the Parker wind models matching the helium data are
self-consistent. Our results are in good agreement with more detailed
self-consistent simulations and constraints from high-resolution transit
spectra.

Title:Low-Energy Supernovae Severely Constrain Radiative Particle Decays,"
Abstract:  The hot and dense core formed in the collapse of a massive star is a powerful
source of hypothetical feebly-interacting particles such as sterile neutrinos,
dark photons, axion-like particles (ALPs), and others. Radiative decays such as
$a\to2\gamma$ deposit this energy in the surrounding material if the mean free
path is less than the radius of the progenitor star. For the first time, we use
a supernova (SN) population with particularly low explosion energies as the
most sensitive calorimeters to constrain this possibility. These SNe are
observationally identified as low-luminosity events with low ejecta velocities
and low masses of ejected $^{56}$Ni. Their low energies limit the energy
deposition from particle decays to less than about 0.1 B, where $1~{\rm
B~(bethe)}=10^{51}~{\rm erg}$. For 1-500 MeV-mass ALPs, this generic argument
excludes ALP-photon couplings $G_{a\gamma\gamma}$ in the

measurements reveal an asymmetrical spatial distribution of metal-rich ejecta
gas. Especially the asymmetry on the western part of the central Fe
distribution is remarkable. While the location of the contact discontinuity is
generally at $\sim 5$ pc from the geometric center of the X-ray emission of DEM
L71, it is uncertain in western part of the remnant. Fe is enhanced in the
ejecta while O and Ne abundances are generally negligible. This finding
confirms the Type Ia origin of DEM L71. We estimate an upper limit on the Sedov
age of $\sim 6,660\pm 770$ yr and explosion energy of $\sim 1.74\pm 0.35\times
10^{51}$ erg for the remnant. This explosion energy estimate is consistent with
a canonical explosion of a Type Ia supernova remnant.

Title:Co-evolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies at high redshift: discrepancies from six cosmological simulations and the key role of JWST,"
Abstract:  The James Webb Space Telescope will have the power to characterize
high-redshift quasars at z>6 with an unprecedented depth and spatial
resolution. While the brightest quasars at such redshift (i.e., with bolometric
luminosity L_bol> 10^46 erg/s) provide us with key information on the most
extreme objects in the Universe, measuring the black hole (BH) mass and
Eddington ratios of fainter quasars with L_bol= 10^45-10^46 erg/s opens a path
to understand the build-up of more normal BHs at z>6. In this paper, we show
that the Illustris, TNG100, TNG300, Horizon-AGN, EAGLE, and SIMBA large-scale
cosmological simulations do not agree on whether BHs at z>4 are overmassive or
undermassive at fixed galaxy stellar mass with respect to the M_BH-M_star
scaling relation at z=0 (BH mass offsets). Our conclusions are unchanged when
using the local scaling relation produced by each simulation or empirical
relations. We find that the BH mass offsets of the simulated faint quasar
population at z>4, unlike those of bright quasars, represent the BH mass
offsets of the entire BH population, for all the simulations. Thus, a
population of faint quasars with L_bol= 10^45-10^46 erg/s observed by JWST can
provide key constraints on the assembly of BHs at high redshift. Moreover, this
will help constraining the high-redshift regime of cosmological simulations,
including BH seeding, early growth, and co-evolution with the host galaxies.
Our results also motivate the need for simulations of larger cosmological
volumes down to z=6, with the same diversity of sub-grid physics, in order to
gain statistics on the most extreme objects at high redshift.

Title:The Pulsating Helium-Atmosphere White Dwarfs I: New DBVs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"
Abstract:  We present a dedicated search for new pulsating helium-atmosphere (DBV) white
dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using the McDonald 2.1m Otto Struve
Telescope. In total we observed 55 DB and DBA white dwarfs with spectroscopic
temperatures between 19,000 and 35,000K. We find 19 new DBVs and place upper
limits on variability for the remaining 36 objects. In combination with
previously known DBVs, we use these objects to provide an update to the
empirical extent of the DB instability strip. With our sample of new DBVs, the
red edge is better constrained, as we nearly double the number of DBVs known
between 20,000 and 24,000K. We do not find any new DBVs hotter than PG
0112+104, the current hottest DBV at $T_{\mathrm{eff}}\,{\approx}$ 31,000K, but
do find pulsations in four DBVs with temperatures between 27,000 and 30,000K,
improving empirical constraints on the poorly defined blue edge. We investigate
the ensemble pulsation properties of all currently known DBVs, finding that the
weighted mean period and total pulsation power exhibit trends with effective
temperature that are qualitatively similar to the pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere
white dwarfs.

Title:Hard-state optical wind during the discovery outburst of the black-hole X-ray dipper MAXI J1803-298,"
Abstract:  We present twelve epochs of optical spectroscopy taken across the discovery
outburst of the black hole candidate MAXI J1803-298 with the GTC and VLT
telescopes. The source followed a standard outburst evolution with hard and
soft states. The system displays a triangular shape in the hardness intensity
diagram, consistent with that seen in high inclination black hole transients
and the previously reported detection of X-ray dips. The two epochs observed
during the initial hard state exhibited asymmetric emission line profiles,
including a P-Cygni profile simultaneously detected in H-alpha and He I 6678,
which indicates the presence of an optical wind in the system. The remaining
spectra, obtained during the transition to the soft state and the subsequent
decay, are instead characterized by narrower, double peaked emission lines
embedded into broad absorption components. One epoch (intermediate state) also
includes near-infrared coverage, revealing complex line profiles in the Paschen
and Bracket series, which suggests that the outflow is still present during the
outburst decay through the soft state. The growing list of low-mass X-ray
binaries with optical and near-infrared outflow signatures indicates that these
are common features. Furthermore, the lowest luminosity spectrum exhibits an
H-alpha full-width-at-half-maximum of 1570 +- 100 km/s. This, together with
previous constraints on the binary parameters, allows us to favor a compact
object mass of ~ 3-10 Msun, further supporting its black hole nature.

Title:The luminosity-dependent contribution from the broad line region to the wavelength-dependent lags in Mrk 110,"
Abstract:  We have measured the wavelength-dependent lags between the X-ray, UV and
optical bands in the high accretion rate ($L/L_{\rm Edd}\approx40\%$) Active
Galactic Nucleus Mrk 110 during two intensive monitoring campaigns in February
and September 2019. We divide the observations into three intervals with
different X-ray luminosities. The first interval, already published in
Vincentelli et al. (2021), has the lowest X-ray luminosity and did not exhibit
the U-band excess positive lag, or the X-ray excess negative lag that is seen
in most AGN. However, these excess lags are seen in the two subsequent
intervals of higher X-ray luminosity. Although the data are limited, the excess
lags appear to scale with X-ray luminosity. Our modelling shows that lags
expected from reprocessing of X-rays by the accretion disc vary hardly at all
with increasing luminosity. Therefore, as the U-band excess almost certainly
arises from Balmer continuum emission from the broad line region (BLR), we
attribute these lag changes to changes in the contribution from the BLR. The
change is easily explained by the usual increase in the inner radius of the BLR
with increasing ionising luminosity.

Title:Creating the Radius Gap without Mass Loss,"
Abstract:  The observed exoplanet population features a gap in the radius distribution
that separates the smaller super-Earths ($\lesssim$1.7 Earth radii) from the
larger sub-Neptunes ($\sim$1.7--4 Earth radii). While mass loss theories can
explain many of the observed features of this radius valley, it is difficult to
reconcile them with potentially rising population of terrestrials beyond
orbital periods of $\sim$30 days. We investigate the ability of gas accretion
during the gas-poor phase of disk evolution to reproduce both the location of
the observed radius gap and the existence of long-period terrestrial planets.
Updating the analytic scaling relations of gas accretion rate accounting for
the shrinking of the bound radius by hydrodynamic effects and deriving a more
realistic disk temperature profile, we find that the late-stage gas accretion
alone is able to carve out the observed radius gap, with slopes $R_{\rm gap}
\propto P^{-0.096}$ and $R_{\rm gap} \propto M_\star^{0.15}$ for top-heavy; and
$R_{\rm gap} \propto P^{-0.089}$ and $R_{\rm gap} \propto M_\star^{0.22}$ for
bottom-heavy core mass distributions, in good agreement with observations. The
general morphology of the primordial radius gap is stable against a range of
disk gas density and disk accretion rate with the latter affecting mostly the
population of large planets ($\gtrsim$3--4$R_\oplus$). The peaks and valleys in
the radius distribution were likely set in place primordially while
post-formation mass loss further tunes the exoplanetary population. We provide
potential observational tests that may be possible with TESS, PLATO and Roman
Space Telescope.

Title:A novel way of measuring the gas disk mass of protoplanetary disks using N2H+ and C18O,"
Abstract:  Measuring the gas mass of protoplanetary disks, the reservoir available for
giant planet formation, has proven to be difficult. We currently lack a
far-infrared observatory capable of observing HD, and the most common gas mass
tracer, CO, suffers from a poorly constrained CO-to-H$_2$ ratio. Expanding on
previous work, we investigate if N2H+, a chemical tracer of CO poor gas, can be
used to observationally measure the CO-to-H$_2$ ratio and correct CO-based gas
masses. Using disk structures obtained from the literature, we set up
thermochemical models for three disks, TW Hya, DM Tau and GM Aur, to examine
how well the CO-to-H$_2$ ratio and gas mass can be measured from N2H+ and C18O
line fluxes. Furthermore, we compare these gas masses to independently gas
masses measured from archival HD observations. The N2H+ (3-2)/C18O (2-1) line
ratio scales with the disk CO-to-H$_2$ ratio. Using these two lines, we measure
4.6e-3 Msun < Mdisk < 1.1e-1 Msun for TW Hya, 1.5e-2 Msun < Mdisk < 9.6e-2 Msun
for GM Aur and 3.1e-2 Msun < Mdisk < 9.6e-2 Msun for DM Tau. These gas masses
agree with values obtained from HD within their respective uncertainties. The
uncertainty on the N2H+ + C18O gas mass can be reduced by observationally
constraining the cosmic ray ionization rate in disks. These results demonstrate
the potential of using the combination of N2H+ and C18O to measure gas masses
of protoplanetary disks.

Title:Fraction of broad absorption line quasars in different radio morphologies,"
Abstract:  In this study, we investigated the orientation model of Broad Absorption Line
(BAL) quasars using a sample of sources that are common in Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) Data Release (DR)-16 quasar catalog and Very Large Array
(VLA)-Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) survey. Using
the radio cut-out images from the FIRST survey, we first designed a deep
learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify the quasar
radio morphologies into the core-only, young jet, single lobe, or triples.
These radio morphologies are further sub-classified into core-dominated and
lobe-dominated sources. The CNN models can classify the sources with a high
precision of >98% for all the morphological sub-classes. The average BAL
fraction in the resolved core, core-dominated, and lobe-dominated quasars are
consistent with the BAL fraction inferred from radio and infra-red surveys. We
also present the distribution of BAL quasars as a function of quasar
orientation by using the radio core-dominance as an orientation indicator. A
similar analysis is performed for HiBALs, LoBALs, and FeLoBALs. All the radio
morphological sub-classes and BAL sub-classes show an increase in BAL fraction
at high orientation angles of the jets with respect to the line of sight. Our
analysis suggests that BAL quasars are more likely to be found in viewing
angles close to the equatorial plane of the quasar. However, a pure orientation
model is inadequate, and a combination of orientation and evolution is probably
the best way to explain the complete BAL phenomena.

Title:Radio AGN in nearby dwarf galaxies: the important role of AGN in dwarf-galaxy evolution,"
Abstract:  We combine deep optical and radio data, from the Hyper Suprime-Cam and the
Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) respectively, to study 78 radio AGN in nearby
(z<0.5) dwarf galaxies. Comparison to a control sample, matched in stellar mass
and redshift, indicates that the AGN and controls reside in similar
environments, show similar star-formation rates (which trace gas availability)
and exhibit a comparable incidence of tidal features (which indicate recent
interactions). We explore the AGN properties by combining the predicted gas
conditions in dwarfs from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with a
Monte-Carlo suite of simulated radio sources, based on a semi-analytical model
for radio-galaxy evolution. In the subset of LOFAR-detectable simulated
sources, which have a similar distribution of radio luminosities as our
observed AGN, the median jet powers, ages and accretion rates are $\sim
10^{35}$ W, $\sim 5$ Myr and $\sim 10^{-3.4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$
respectively. The median mechanical energy output of these sources is $\sim100$
times larger than the median binding energy expected in dwarf gas reservoirs,
making AGN feedback plausible. Since special circumstances (in terms of
environment, gas availability and interactions) are not necessary for the
presence of AGN, and the central gas masses are predicted to be an order of
magnitude larger than that required to fuel the AGN, AGN triggering in dwarfs
is likely to be stochastic and a common phenomenon. Together with the
plausibility of energetic feedback, this suggests that AGN could be important
drivers of dwarf-galaxy evolution, as is the case in massive galaxies.

Title:Final Report for SAG 21: The Effect of Stellar Contamination on Space-based Transmission Spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  Study Analysis Group 21 (SAG21) of the Exoplanet Exploration Program Analysis
Group (ExoPAG) was organized to study the effect of stellar contamination on
space-based transmission spectroscopy, a method for studying exoplanetary
atmospheres by measuring the wavelength-dependent radius of a planet as it
transits its star. Transmission spectroscopy relies on a precise understanding
of the spectrum of the star being occulted. However, stars are not homogeneous,
constant light sources but have temporally evolving photospheres and
chromospheres with inhomogeneities like spots, faculae, and plages. This SAG
has brought together an interdisciplinary team of more than 100 scientists,
with observers and theorists from the heliophysics, stellar astrophysics,
planetary science, and exoplanetary atmosphere research communities, to study
the current needs that can be addressed in this context to make the most of
transit studies from current NASA facilities like HST and JWST. The analysis
produced 14 findings, which fall into three Science Themes encompassing (1) how
the Sun is used as our best laboratory to calibrate our understanding of
stellar heterogeneities (""The Sun as the Stellar Benchmark""), (2) how stars
other than the Sun extend our knowledge of heterogeneities (""Surface
Heterogeneities of Other Stars"") and (3) how to incorporate information
gathered for the Sun and other stars into transit studies (""Mapping Stellar
Knowledge to Transit Studies"").

Title:A massive AGB donor in Scutum X-1: Identification of the first Mira variable in an X-ray binary,"
Abstract:  The symbiotic X-ray binary Sct X-1 was suggested as the first known neutron
star accreting from a red supergiant companion. Although known for nearly 50
years, detailed characterization of the donor remains lacking, particularly due
to the extremely high reddening towards the source ($A_V\gtrsim25$ mag). Here,
we present i) improved localization of the counterpart using Gaia and Chandra
observations, ii) the first broadband infrared spectrum ($\approx1-5\,\mu$m;
$R\approx 2000$) obtained with SpeX on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and
iii) $J$-band light curve from the Palomar Gattini-IR survey. The infrared
spectrum is characterized by i) deep water absorption features (H$_2$O index
$\approx 40$%), ii) strong TiO, VO and CO features, and iii) weak/absent CN
lines. We show that these features are inconsistent with known red supergiants,
but suggest a M8-9 III type O-rich Mira donor star. We report the discovery of
large amplitude ($\Delta J\approx3.5$ mag) periodic photometric variability
suggesting a pulsation period of
$621\pm36\,{\rm(systematic)}\pm8\,{\rm(statistical)}$ days, which we use to
constrain the donor to be a relatively luminous Mira ($M_K=-8.6\pm0.3$ mag) at
a distance of $3.6^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ kpc. Comparing these characteristics to
recent models, we find the donor to be consistent with a $\approx 3-5$
M$_\odot$ star at an age of $\approx 0.1-0.3$ Gyr. Together, we show that Sct
X-1 was previously mis-classified as an evolved High Mass X-ray Binary; instead
it is an intermediate mass system with the first confirmed Mira donor in an
X-ray binary. We discuss the implications of Mira donors in symbiotic X-ray
binaries, and highlight the potential of wide-field infrared time domain
surveys and broadband infrared spectroscopy to unveil their demographics.

Title:Paradigm shift in understanding the Galactic eROSITA Bubbles,"
Abstract:  The magnificent bubbles at the Galactic center provide a great channel to
understand the effects of feedback on galaxy evolution. The newly discovered
eROSITA bubbles show enhanced X-ray emission from the shells around bubbles.
Previous works assumed that the X-ray emitting gas in the shells has a single
temperature component and that they trace the shock-heated lower-temperature
Galactic halo gas. Here we show that the thermal structure of the eROSITA
bubble shells is more complex. Using Suzaku observations we find with high
confidence that the X-ray emission from the shells is best described by a
two-temperature thermal model, one near Galaxy's virial temperature at $\rm kT
\approx 0.2 ~keV$ and the other at super-virial temperatures ranging between
$\rm kT = 0.4-1.1 ~keV$. Furthermore, we show that temperatures of the virial
and super-virial components are similar in the shells and in the ambient
medium, although the emission measures are significantly higher in the shells.
We argue that the X-ray bright eROSITA bubble shells are the signature of
compressed isothermal radiative shocks. The age of the bubbles is constrained
to $70$--$\rm 130~Myr$. This expansion timescale, as well as the observed
non-solar Ne/O and Mg/O ratios, favor the stellar feedback models for the
formation of the Galactic bubbles, settling a long-standing debate on the
origin of the Galactic bubbles.

Abstract:  We confirm the existence of a second Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) star
cluster, KMHK 1592, with an age that falls in the middle of the so-called LMC
star cluster age gap, a long period of time (~ 4 - 11 Gyr) where no star
cluster had been uncovered, except ESO121-SC03. The age (8.0+-0.5 Gyr) and the
metallicity ([Fe/H]=-1.0+-0.2 dex) of KMHK1592 were derived from the fit of
theoretical isochrones to the intrinsic star cluster colour-magnitude diagram
sequences, which were unveiled using a robust star-by-star membership
probability procedure. Because of the relative low brightness of the star
cluster, deep GEMINI GMOS images were used. We discuss the pros and cons of
three glimpsed scenarios that could explain the presence of both LMC age gap
star clusters in the outskirts of the LMC, namely: in-situ star cluster
formation, capture from the Small Magellanic Cloud, or accretion of a small

Title:Ancestral Black Holes of Binary Merger GW190521,"
Abstract:  GW190521 was the most massive black hole merger discovered by LIGO/Virgo so
far, with masses in tension with stellar evolution models. A possible
explanation of such heavy black holes is that they themselves are the remnants
of previous mergers of lighter black holes. Here we estimate the masses of the
ancestral black holes of GW190521, assuming it is the end product of previous
mergers. We find that the heaviest parental black holes has a mass of
$62^{+21}_{-19}$ M$_\odot$ (90% credible level). We find 78% probability that
it is in the $50$ M$_\odot-120$ M$_\odot$ mass gap, indicating that it may also
be the end product of a previous merger. We therefore also compute the expected
mass distributions of the ""grandparent"" black holes of GW190521, assuming they
existed. Ancestral black hole masses could represent an additional puzzle piece
in identifying the origin of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA's heaviest black holes.

Abstract:  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the nearest laboratory for detailed
studies on the formation and survival of complex organic molecules (COMs),
including biologically important ones, in low-metallicity environments--typical
for earlier cosmological epochs. We report the results of 1.2 mm continuum and
molecular line observations of three fields in the star-forming region N105
with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). N105 lies at the
western edge of the LMC bar with on-going star formation traced by H$_2$O, OH,
and CH$_3$OH masers, ultracompact H II regions, and young stellar objects.
Based on the spectral line modeling, we estimated rotational temperatures,
column densities, and fractional molecular abundances for twelve 1.2 mm
continuum sources. We identified sources with a range of chemical make-ups,
including two bona fide hot cores and four hot core candidates. The CH$_3$OH
emission is widespread and associated with all the continuum sources. COMs
CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$OCH$_3$ are detected toward two hot cores in N105 together
with smaller molecules typically found in Galactic hot cores (e.g., SO$_2$, SO,
and HNCO) with the molecular abundances roughly scaling with metallicity. We
report a tentative detection of the astrobiologically relevant formamide
molecule (NH$_2$CHO) toward one of the hot cores; if confirmed, this would be
the first detection of NH$_2$CHO in an extragalactic sub-solar metallicity
environment. We suggest that metallicity inhomogeneities resulting from the
tidal interactions between the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) might
have led to the observed large variations in COM abundances in LMC hot cores.

Title:Far and extreme UV radiation feedback in molecular clouds and its influence on the mass and size of star clusters,"
Abstract:  We study the formation of star clusters in molecular clouds by performing
three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations with far ultraviolet
(FUV; $6 ~{\rm eV} \leqq h \nu \leqq 13.6 ~{\rm eV}$) and extreme ultraviolet
(EUV; $h\nu \geqq 13.6~{\rm eV}$) radiative feedback. We find that the FUV
feedback significantly suppresses the star formation in diffuse clouds with the
initial surface densities of $\Sigma_{\rm cl} \lesssim \rm 50~M_{\odot} \;
pc^{-2}$. In the cases of clouds with $\Sigma_{\rm cl} \sim \rm
100-200~M_{\odot} \; pc^{-2}$, the EUV feedback plays a main role and decrease
the star formation efficiencies less than $0.3$. We show that thermal pressure
from PDRs or H{\sc ii} regions disrupts the clouds and makes the size of the
star clusters larger. Consequently, the clouds with the mass $M_{\rm cl}
\lesssim 10^{5}~\rm M_{\odot}$ and the surface density $\Sigma_{\rm cl}
\lesssim 200~\rm M_{\odot}\; pc^{-2}$ remain the star clusters with the stellar
densities of $\sim 100~\rm M_{\odot}\; pc^{-3}$ that nicely match the observed
open clusters in the Milky Way. If the molecular clouds are massive ($M_{\rm
cl} \gtrsim 10^{5}~\rm M_{\odot}$) and compact ($\Sigma \gtrsim 400~\rm
M_{\odot}\; pc^{-2}$), the radiative feedback is not effective and they form
massive dense cluster with the stellar densities of $\sim 10^{4}~\rm
M_{\odot}\; pc^{-3}$ like observed globular clusters or young massive star
clusters. Thus, we suggest that the radiative feedback and the initial
conditions of molecular clouds are key factors inducing the variety of the
observed star clusters.

Abstract:  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the most luminous satellite galaxy of the
Milky Way and owing to its companion, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC),
represents an excellent laboratory to study the interaction of dwarf galaxies.
The aim of this study is to investigate the kinematics of the outer regions of
the LMC by using stellar proper motions to understand the impact of
interactions, e.g. with the SMC about 250 Myr ago. {We calculate proper motions
using multi-epoch $K_\mathrm{s}$-band images from the VISTA survey of the
Magellanic Clouds system (VMC). Observations span a time baseline of 2$-$5 yr.
We combine the VMC data with data from the Gaia early Data Release 3 and
introduce a new method to distinguish between Magellanic and Milky Way stars
based on a machine learning algorithm. This new technique enables a larger and
cleaner sample selection of fainter sources as it reaches below the red clump

LMC and find hints of stripped SMC debris. The south east region of the LMC
shows a slow rotational speed compared to the overall rotation. $N$-body
simulations suggest that this could be caused by a fraction of stripped SMC
stars, located in that particular region, that move opposite to the expected
rotation.

Abstract:  In 2017, the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) published its first data release

planet radii revealed that small planets are bifurcated into two distinct
populations: super-Earths (smaller than 1.5 $R_E$) and sub-Neptunes (between
2.0 and 4.0 $R_E$), with few planets in between (the ""Radius Gap."") Several
theoretical models of the Radius Gap predict variation with stellar mass, but
testing these predictions are challenging with CKS DR1 due to its limited

mechanisms. We found no evidence that $m$ varies with $M_\star$. We observed a

\propto M_\star^\alpha$ with $\alpha = 0.25 \pm 0.03$. In contrast, there is no
detectable change for super-Earths. These $M_\star$-$R_p$ trends suggests that
protoplanetary disks can efficiently produce cores up to a threshold mass of
$M_c$, which grows linearly with stellar mass according to $M_c \approx 10
M_E~(M_\star / M_\odot)$. There is no significant correlation between
sub-Neptune size and stellar metallicity (over $-$0.5 to $+$0.5 dex) suggesting
a weak relationship between planet envelope opacity and stellar metallicity.
Finally, there is no significant variation in sub-Neptune size with stellar age
(over 1 to 10 Gyr), which suggests that the majority of envelope contraction
concludes after $\sim$1 Gyr.

Title:Mysterious Odd Radio Circle near the Large Magellanic Cloud -- An Intergalactic Supernova Remnant?,"
Abstract:  We report the discovery of J0624-6948, a low-surface brightness radio ring,
lying between the Galactic Plane and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). It was
first detected at 888 MHz with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
(ASKAP), and with a diameter of ~196 arcsec. This source has phenomenological
similarities to Odd Radio Circles (ORCs). Significant differences to the known
ORCs - a flatter radio spectral index, the lack of a prominent central galaxy
as a possible host, and larger apparent size - suggest that J0624-6948 may be a
different type of object. We argue that the most plausible explanation for
J0624-6948 is an intergalactic supernova remnant due to a star that resided in
the LMC outskirts that had undergone a single-degenerate type Ia supernova, and
we are seeing its remnant expand into a rarefied, intergalactic environment. We
also examine if a massive star or a white dwarf binary ejected from either
galaxy could be the supernova progenitor. Finally, we consider several other
hypotheses for the nature of the object, including the jets of an active
galactic nucleus (AGN) or the remnant of a nearby stellar super-flare.

"Title:ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions -- VIII. A search for hot cores by using C$_2$H$_5$CN, CH$_3$OCHO and CH$_3$OH lines","
Abstract:  Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are
considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical
environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by
using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules
(C$_2$H$_5$CN, CH$_3$OCHO and CH$_3$OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter
Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions
and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10
mJy/beam, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being
newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas
temperatures ($>$ 100 K) and small source sizes ($<$ 0.1 pc). So far this is
the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and
spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen
differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores.
Column densities of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$OCHO increase as rotation temperatures
rise. The column density of CH$_3$OCHO correlates tightly with that of
CH$_3$OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based
on the spatial position difference between hot cores and UC~H{\sc ii} regions,
we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated while the other hot cores
are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help
establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and
astrochemistry.

Title:GENGA II: GPU planetary N-body simulations with non-Newtonian forces and high number of particles,"
Abstract:  We present recent updates and improvements of the graphical processing unit
(GPU) N-body code GENGA. Modern state-of-the-art simulations of planet
formation require the use of a very high number of particles to accurately
resolve planetary growth and to quantify the effect of dynamical friction. At
present the practical upper limit is in the range of 30,000 - 60,000 fully
interactive particles; possibly a little more on the latest GPU devices. While
the original hybrid symplectic integration method has difficulties to scale up
to these numbers, we have improved the integration method by i) introducing
higher level changeover functions and ii) code improvements to better use the
most recent GPU hardware efficiently for such large simulations. We added
treatments of non-Newtonian forces such as general relativity, tidal
interaction, rotational deformation, the Yarkovsky effect, and
Poynting-Robertson drag, as well as a new model to treat virtual collisions of
small bodies in the solar system. We added new tools to GENGA, such as
semi-active test particles that feel more massive bodies but not each other, a
more accurate collision handling and a real-time openGL visualization. We
present example simulations, including a 1.5 billion year terrestrial planet
formation simulation that initially started with 65,536 particles, a 3.5
billion year simulation without gas giants starting with 32,768 particles, the
evolution of asteroid fragments in the solar system, and the planetesimal
accretion of a growing Jupiter simulation. GENGA runs on modern NVIDIA and AMD
GPUs.

Title:Statistical analysis of intermittency and its association with proton heating in the near Sun environment,"
Abstract:  We use data from the first six encounters of Parker Solar Probe and employ
the Partial Variance of Increments ($PVI$) method to study the statistical
properties of coherent structures in the inner heliosphere with the aim of
exploring physical connections between magnetic field intermittency and
observable consequences such as plasma heating and turbulence dissipation. Our
results support proton heating localized in the vicinity of, and strongly
correlated with, magnetic structures characterized by $PVI \geq 1$. We show
that on average, such events constitute $\approx 19\%$ of the dataset, though
variations may occur depending on the plasma parameters. We show that the
waiting time distribution ($WT$) of identified events is consistent across all
six encounters following a power-law scaling at lower $WTs$. This result
indicates that coherent structures are not evenly distributed in the solar wind
but rather tend to be tightly correlated and form clusters. We observe that the
strongest magnetic discontinuities, $PVI \geq 6$, usually associated with
reconnection exhausts, are sites where magnetic energy is locally dissipated in
proton heating and are associated with the most abrupt changes in proton
temperature. However, due to the scarcity of such events, their relative
contribution to energy dissipation is minor. Taking clustering effects into
consideration, we show that smaller scale, more frequent structures with PVI
between, $1\lesssim PVI \lesssim 6$, play the major role in magnetic energy
dissipation. The number density of such events is strongly associated with the
global solar wind temperature, with denser intervals being associated with
higher $T_{p}$.

Title:relensing: Reconstructing the mass profile of galaxy clusters from gravitational lensing,"
Abstract:  In this work we present relensing, a package written in python whose goal is
to model galaxy clusters from gravitational lensing. With relensing we extend
the amount of software available, which provides the scientific community with
a wide range of models that help to compare and therefore validate the physical
results that rely on them. We implement a free-form approach which computes the
gravitational deflection potential on an adaptive irregular grid, from which
one can characterize the cluster and its properties as a gravitational lens.
Here, we use two alternative penalty functions to constrain strong lensing. We
apply relensing to two toy models, in order to explore under which conditions
one can get a better performance in the reconstruction. We find that by
applying a smoothing to the deflection potential, we are able to increase the
capability of this approach to recover the shape and size of the mass profile
of galaxy clusters, as well as its magnification map. This translates into a
better estimation of the critical and caustic curves. The power that the
smoothing provides is also tested on the simulated clusters Ares and Hera, for
which we get an rms on the lens plane of ~0.17 arcsec and ~0.16 arcsec,
respectively. Our results represent an improvement with respect to
reconstructions that were carried out with methods of the same nature as
relensing. At the same time, the smoothing also increases the stability of our
implementation, and decreases the computation time. In its current state,
relensing is available upon request.

Title:Solar Radio-Frequency Reflectivity and Localization of FRB from Solar Reflection,"
Abstract:  The radiation of a Fast Radio Burst (FRB) reflects from the Moon and Sun. If
a reflection is detected, the time interval between the direct and reflected
signals constrains the source to a narrow arc on the sky. If both Lunar and
Solar reflections are detected these two arcs intersect, narrowly confining the
source location on the sky. A previous paper calculated reflection by the Moon.
Here we calculate the reflectivity of the Sun in the ""flat Sun"" approximation
as a function of angle of incidence and frequency. The reflectivity is high at
frequencies $\lessapprox 100\,$MHz and grazing incidence (angles $\gtrapprox
60^\circ$), but exceeds 0.1 for frequencies $\lessapprox 80\,$MHz at all
angles. However, the intense thermal emission of the Solar corona likely
precludes detection of the Solar reflection of even MJy Galactic bursts like
FRB 200428.

Title:Mixing fraction in classical novae,"
Abstract:  Context. Classical novae are powered by thermonuclear runaways occurring on
the surface of accreting white dwarfs (WDs). In the observations, the
enrichments of heavy elements in nova ejecta have been detected, indicating a
mixing process between the accreted matter and the matter from the outer layers
of the underlying WDs prior to nova outbursts. However, the mixing fraction in
classical novae is still uncertain.
Aims. The purpose of this article is to investigate some elemental abundance
ratios during nova outbursts that can be used to estimate the WD mixing
fraction in classical novae.
Methods. By considering different WD mixing fractions with the stellar
evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we
carried out a series of simulations of nova outbursts, in which the initial CO
WD masses range from $0.7-1.0\,M_\odot$.
Results. We identified four elemental abundance ratios (i.e. $\rm (H+He)/\sum
CNO$, $\rm (H+He)/Ne$, $\rm \sum CNO/Mg,$ and $\rm \sum CNO/Si$) that satisfy
the conditions for determining the WD mixing fraction, in which $\rm
(H+He)/\sum CNO$ is the most suitable mixing meter. We also estimated the WD
mixing fraction in some representative classical novae. Additionally, we found
that a higher metallicity (i.e. higher WD mixing fraction) is preferentially
accompanied by a longer $t_{\rm 2}$ (the time of decline by two magnitudes from
peak luminosity) during nova outbursts. Our results can be used to constrain
the mixing process in classical novae.

detect anomalous objects; and a JavaScript frontend to allow interaction with
the data, labelling of interesting anomalous and active learning. Astronomaly
is designed to be modular, extendable and run on almost any type of

Title:The DRAKE mission: finding the frequency of life in the Cosmos,"
Abstract:  In the search for life in the Universe, exoplanets represent numerous natural
experiments in planet formation, evolution, and the emergence of life. This
raises the fascinating prospect of evaluating cosmic life on a statistical
basis. One key statistic is the occurrence rate of life-bearing worlds, $f_{\rm
L}$, the 'frequency of life' term in the famous Drake Equation. Measuring
$f_{\rm L}$ would give profound insight into how common life is and may help to
constrain origin-of-life theories. I propose $f_{\rm L}$ as the goal for the
DRAKE mission (Dedicated Research for Advancing Knowledge of Exobiology): a
transit spectroscopy survey of M-dwarf habitable zone terrestrial planets. I
investigate how the uncertainty on the observed value of $f_{\rm L}$ scales
with sample size. I determine that sampling error dominates over observational
error and that the uncertainty is a function of the observed $f_{\rm L}$ value.
I show that even small sample sizes can provide significant constraints on
$f_{\rm L}$, boding well for the transit spectroscopy approach. I perform a
feasibility study of the DRAKE mission using a nominal instrument design and
mission plan. Due to low observing efficiencies, DRAKE may need to be
incorporated into a wider-ranging deep-space or lunar observatory. A 50-planet
survey could constrain $f_{\rm L}$ to $\leq$ 0.06 (at 95% confidence) if the
sample $f_{\rm L}$ = 0, or 0.03-0.2 if the sample $f_{\rm L}$ = 0.1. This can
be achieved (on average) in 10 years using a 17-m telescope with an
unrestricted field-of-regard. DRAKE is a viable approach to attempting the
first experimental measurement of $f_{\rm L}$.

Title:Accurate effective fluid approximation for ultralight axions,"
Abstract:  Ultralight axions are theoretically interesting and phenomenologically rich
dark sector candidates, but they are difficult to track across cosmological
timescales because of their fast oscillations. We resolve this problem by
developing a novel method to evolve them efficiently and accurately. We first
construct an exact effective fluid which at late times matches the axion but
which evolves in a simple way. We then approximate this evolution with a
carefully chosen equation of state and sound speed. With our scheme we find
that we can obtain subpercent accuracy for the linear theory suppression of
axion density fluctuations relative to that of cold dark matter without
tracking even a single complete oscillation of the axion field. We use our
technique to test other approximation schemes and to provide a fitting formula
for the transfer function for the matter power spectrum in linear theory in
axion models. Implementing our approach in existing cosmological axion codes is
straightforward and will help unleash the potential of high-precision
next-generation experiments.

Title:Testing time evolution of the mass distribution of the black hole mergers,"
Abstract:  Detection of the gravitational-wave events revealed that there are numerous
population of the black hole binaries which can merge within the age of the
Universe. Although several formation channels of such binaries are known,
considerable theoretical uncertainties associated in each channel defeats the
robust prediction of how much each channel contributes to the total merger rate
density. Given that the time evolution of the merger rate density in some
channels is (exactly or nearly) independent of the BH masses, clarifying this
feature from the observational data will shed some light on the nature of the
black hole binaries. Based on this motivation, we formulate the methodology to
perform the statistical test of whether the mass distribution of the black hole
mergers evolves in time or not by means of the hypothesis testing. Our
statistical test requires neither a priori specification of the mass
distribution which is largely uncertain nor that of the time dependence of the
merger rate. We then apply it to the mock data for some concrete shapes of the
merger rate density and show that the proposed method rejects/(does not reject)
the null hypothesis correctly for the large sample size. We also investigate if
the catalog of the gravitational-wave events obtained during the LIGO-Virgo's
third observing run has a large sample size enough to apply our hypothesis
testing. We find that the number of the events is too small to draw any
statistical conclusion regarding our test and the meaningful result of our
hypothesis testing can be obtained only by the future detectors having much
better sensitivity. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
hypothesis testing to determine from the (future) observational data whether
the merger rate density evolves in time independently of the BH masses or not.

Title:Improving INTEGRAL/SPI data analysis of GRBs,"
Abstract:  INTEGRAL/SPI is a coded mask instrument observing since 2002 in the keV to
MeV energy range, which covers the peak of the $\nu F\nu$ spectrum of most
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). Since its launch in 2008, Fermi/GBM has been the
primary instrument for analyzing GRBs in the energy range between $\approx$ 10
keV to $\approx$ 10 MeV. Herein, we show that SPI, covering a similar energy
range, can give equivalently constraining results for some parameters if we use
an advanced analysis method. Also, combining the data of both instruments
reduces the allowed parameter space in spectral fits. The main advantage of SPI
as compared to GBM is the energy resolution of $\approx$ 0.2\% at 1.3 MeV
compared to $\approx$ 10\% for GBM. Therefore, SPI is an ideal instrument to
precisely measure the curvature of the spectrum. This is important, as it has
been shown in recent years that physical models rather than heuristic functions
should be fit to GRB data to obtain better insights into their still unknown
emission mechanism, and the curvature of the peak is unique to the different
physical models. To fit physical models to SPI GRB data and get the maximal
amount of information from the data, we developed a new open source analysis
software {\tt PySPI}. We apply these new techniques to GRB 120711A in order to
validate and showcase {\tt PySPI}'s capabilities. We show that {\tt PySPI}
improves the analysis of SPI GRB data compared to the {\tt OSA} analysis. In
addition, we demonstrate that the GBM and the SPI data of this GRB can be
fitted well with a physical synchrotron model. This evinces that SPI can play
an important role in GRB spectral model fitting.

Title:Discerning between different 'Oumuamua models by optical and infrared observations,"
Abstract:  The first interstellar object to be observed in our solar system 1I/2017 U1
'Oumuamua combines the lack of observable cometary activity with an
extra-gravitational acceleration. This has given rise to several mutually
exclusive explanations based on different assumptions in the material
composition of 'Oumuamua. We show how a combination of observations in the
infrared and optical spectra may serve to distinguish between these
explanations once another object with 'Omuamua-like properties comes close
enough to earth. This possibility is linked to the widely different thermal
properties of the different material models that have been proposed. Developing
a model for the thermal conduction and infrared signal from a fractal model we
compare predictions of the infrared signal with that from standard thermal
models that assume 'Oumuamua to be either a solid piece of rock/ice or a thin
sheet.

Abstract:  Detecting molecular line emission from classical nova remnants has the
potential of revealing information on the composition of the ejecta, in
particular, it can deliver accurate isotopic ratios in the matter processed by
a thermonuclear runaway. We conducted searches toward more than 100 classical
novae for emission in lines of the CO or HCN molecules using single-dish
telescopes and interferometric arrays at millimeter and submillimeter
wavelengths. The survey demonstrates that classical novae, young or old, are
not strong sources of molecular emission at submillimeter and millimeter
wavelengths. Additionally, we mapped CO emission around Nova Persei 1901 (GK
Per), earlier claimed to be circumstellar in origin. Our measurements indicate
that the observed emission is from the interstellar medium. Although no
molecular emission at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths has been found
in classical novae, it is still likely that some will be detected with
high-sensitivity interferometers such as ALMA.

Title:The sharp ALMA view of infall and outflow in the massive protocluster G31.41+0.31,"
Abstract:  Context. To better understand the formation of high-mass stars, it is
fundamental to investigate how matter accretes onto young massive stars, how it
is ejected, and how all this differs from the low-mass case. The massive
protocluster G31.41+0.31 is the ideal target to study all these processes
because observations at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths have resolved the
emission of the Main core into at least four massive dust continuum sources,
named A, B, C, and D, within 1"" or 0.018 pc, and have identified signatures of
infall and several outflows associated with the core. Aims. We study the
interplay between infall and outflow in G31.41+0.31 by investigating at a
spatial resolution of a few 100 au their properties and their possible impact
on the core. Methods. We carried out molecular line observations of typical
high-density tracers, such as CH3CN or H2CO, and shock and outflow tracers,
such as SiO, with ALMA at 1.4 mm that achieved an angular resolution of 0.09""
(340 au). Results. The observations have revealed inverse P-Cygni profiles in
CH3CN and H2CO toward the four sources embedded in the Main core, suggesting
that all of them are undergoing collapse. The infall rates, estimated from the
red-shifted absorption are on the order of 1E-2 Msun/yr. The individual infall
rates imply that the accretion timescale of the Main core is an order of
magnitude smaller than its rotation timescale. This confirms that rotating
toroids such as the G31 Main core are non-equilibrium, transient collapsing
structures that need to be constantly replenished with fresh material from a
large-scale reservoir. For sources B, C, and D, the infall could be
accelerating inside the sources, while for source A, the presence of a second
emission component complicates the interpretation. The SiO observations have
revealed the presence of at least six outflows in the G31.41+0.31 star-forming

Title:Constraints on the structure and seasonal variations of Triton's atmosphere from the 5 October 2017 stellar occultation and previous observations,"
Abstract:  A stellar occultation by Neptune's main satellite, Triton, was observed on 5
October 2017 from Europe, North Africa, and the USA. We derived 90 light curves
from this event, 42 of which yielded a central flash detection.
We aimed at constraining Triton's atmospheric structure and the seasonal
variations of its atmospheric pressure since the Voyager 2 epoch (1989). We
also derived the shape of the lower atmosphere from central flash analysis. We
used Abel inversions and direct ray-tracing code to provide the density,
pressure, and temperature profiles in the altitude range $\sim$8 km to
$\sim$190 km, corresponding to pressure levels from 9 {\mu}bar down to a few
nanobars.
Results. (i) A pressure of 1.18$\pm$0.03 {\mu}bar is found at a reference
radius of 1400 km (47 km altitude). (ii) A new analysis of the Voyager 2 radio
science occultation shows that this is consistent with an extrapolation of
pressure down to the surface pressure obtained in 1989. (iii) A survey of
occultations obtained between 1989 and 2017 suggests that an enhancement in
surface pressure as reported during the 1990s might be real, but debatable, due
to very few high S/N light curves and data accessible for reanalysis. The
volatile transport model analysed supports a moderate increase in surface
pressure, with a maximum value around 2005-2015 no higher than 23 {\mu}bar. The
pressures observed in 1995-1997 and 2017 appear mutually inconsistent with the
volatile transport model presented here. (iv) The central flash structure does
not show evidence of an atmospheric distortion. We find an upper limit of
0.0011 for the apparent oblateness of the atmosphere near the 8 km altitude.

Title:Doppler boosting the stochastic gravitational wave background,"
Abstract:  One of the guaranteed features of the stochastic gravitational wave
background (SGWB) is the presence of Doppler anisotropies induced by the motion
of the detector with respect to the rest frame of the SGWB source. We point out
that kinematic effects can be amplified if the SGWB is characterised by large
tilts in its spectrum as a function of frequency, or by sizeable intrinsic
anisotropies. Hence we examine the possibility to use Doppler effects as
complementary probes of the SGWB frequency profile. For this purpose we work in
multipole space, and we study the effect of kinematic modulation and aberration
on the GW energy density parameter and on its angular power spectrum. We
develop a Fisher forecast analysis and we discuss prospects for constraining
parameters controlling kinematically induced anisotropies with future detector
networks. As a case study, we apply our framework to a background component
with constant slope in frequency, potentially detectable by a network of future
ground-based interferometers. For this specific example, we show that a
measurement of kinematic anisotropies with a network of Einstein Telescope and
Cosmic Explorer will allow us to constrain the spectral shape with a precision
of about 16$\%$. Finally, we identify cosmological and astrophysical scenarios
where kinematic effects are enhanced in frequency ranges probed by current and
future GW experiments.

Abstract:  We investigate how different mid-infrared (mid-IR) properties of galaxies
trace the environment in which the galaxies are located. For this purpose, we
first study the dependence of galaxy clustering on the absolute magnitude at
3.4 $\mu$m and redshift. Then, we look into the correlation between various
mid-IR properties and the environment. We also explore how various infrared
galaxy luminosity selections influence the galaxy clustering measurements. We
use a set of W1 (3.4 $\mu$m) absolute magnitude ($M_\text{W1}$) selected
samples from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey matched with mid-IR
properties from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in the redshift
range $0.07 \leq z < 0.43$. We compute the galaxy two-point correlation
function (2pCF) and compare the clustering lengths between subsamples binned in
$M_\text{W1}$ and in redshift. We also measure the marked correlation functions
(MCFs) using the luminosities in the WISE W1 to W4 (3.4 to 22 $\mu$m) bands. We
also measure MCFs with different estimates of stellar mass and star formation
rate used as marks and compare the results. Finally, we check how different
selections applied to the sample affect the clustering measurements. We show
strong clustering dependence on the W1 absolute magnitude: galaxies brighter in
the W1 band are more strongly clustered than their fainter counterparts. We
also observe a lack of significant redshift dependence of clustering in the
redshift range $0.07 \leq z < 0.43$. We show that W1 and W2 bands closely
follow the stellar mass and W3 and W4 bands closely follow the star formation
rate in tracing the galaxy clustering. We demonstrate the agreement between
different estimates of the stellar mass and the star formation rate in tracing

interferometers. Intensity interferometers do not rely on phase coherence of
the optical elements and thus function without high grade optics and light
combining delay lines. However, the coherence time of starlight observed with
realistic optical filter bandwidths (> 0.1 nm) is usually much smaller than the
time resolution of the detection system (> 10 ps), resulting in a greatly
reduced correlation signal. Reaching high signal to noise in a reasonably short
measurement time can be achieved in different ways: either by increasing the
time resolution, which increases the correlation signal height, or by
increasing the photon rate, which decreases statistical uncertainties of the
measurement. We present laboratory measurements employing both approaches and
directly compare them in terms of signal to noise ratio. A high time-resolution
interferometry setup designed for small to intermediate size optical telescopes
and thus lower photon rates (diameters < some meters) is compared to a setup
capable of measuring high photon rates, which is planned to be installed at
Cherenkov telescopes with dish diameters of > 10 m. We use a Xenon lamp as a
common light source simulating starlight. Both setups measure the expected
correlation signal and work at the expected shot-noise limit of statistical
uncertainties for measurement times between 10 min and 23 h. We discuss the
quantitative differences in the measurement results and give an overview of
suitable operation regimes for each of the interferometer concepts.

Title:Pair-instability mass loss for top-down compact object mass calculations,"
Abstract:  Population synthesis relies on semi-analytic formulae to determine masses of
compact objects from the (helium or carbon-oxygen) cores of collapsing stars.
Such formulae are combined across mass ranges that span different explosion
mechanisms, potentially introducing artificial features in the compact object
mass distribution. Such artifacts impair the interpretation of
gravitational-wave observations. We propose a ""top-down"" remnant mass
prescription where we remove mass from the star for each possible mass-loss
mechanism, instead of relying on the fallback onto a ""proto-compact-object"" to
get the final mass. For one of these mass-loss mechanisms, we fit the
metallicity-dependent mass lost to pulsational-pair instability supernovae from
numerical simulations. By imposing no mass loss in the absence of pulses, our
approach recovers the existing compact object masses prescription at the low
mass end and ensures continuity across the
core-collapse/pulsational-pair-instability regime. Our remnant mass
prescription can be extended to include other mass-loss mechanisms at the final
collapse.

Title:Simulation of Nuclear Recoils due to Supernova Neutrino-induced Neutrons in Liquid Xenon Detectors,"
Abstract:  Neutrinos from supernova (SN) bursts can give rise to detectable number of
nuclear recoil (NR) events through the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus
scattering (CE$\nu$NS) process in large scale liquid xenon detectors designed
for direct dark matter search, depending on the SN progenitor mass and
distance. Here we show that in addition to the direct NR events due to
CE$\nu$NS process, the SN neutrinos can give rise to additional nuclear recoils
due to the elastic scattering of neutrons produced through inelastic
interaction of the neutrinos with the xenon nuclei. We find that the
contribution of the supernova neutrino-induced neutrons ($\nu$I$n$) can
significantly modify the total xenon NR spectrum at large recoil energies
compared to that expected from the CE$\nu$NS process alone. Moreover, for
recoil energies $\gtrsim20$ keV, dominant contribution is obtained from the
($\nu$I$n$) events. We numerically calculate the observable S1 and S2 signals
due to both CE$\nu$NS and $\nu$I$n$ processes for a typical liquid xenon based
detector, accounting for the multiple scattering effects of the neutrons in the
case of $\nu$I$n$, and find that sufficiently large signal events, those with
S1$\gtrsim$50 photo-electrons (PE) and S2$\gtrsim$2300 PE, come mainly from the
$\nu$I$n$ scatterings.

Title:The 1.28 GHz MeerKAT Galactic Center Mosaic,"
Abstract:  The inner $\sim$200 pc region of the Galaxy contains a 4 million M$_{\odot}$
supermassive black hole (SMBH), significant quantities of molecular gas, and
star formation and cosmic ray energy densities that are roughly two orders of
magnitude higher than the corresponding levels in the Galactic disk. At a
distance of only 8.2 kpc, the region presents astronomers with a unique
opportunity to study a diverse range of energetic astrophysical phenomena, from
stellar objects in extreme environments, to the SMBH and star-formation driven
feedback processes that are known to influence the evolution of galaxies as a
whole. We present a new survey of the Galactic center conducted with the South
African MeerKAT radio telescope. Radio imaging offers a view that is unaffected
by the large quantities of dust that obscure the region at other wavelengths,
and a scene of striking complexity is revealed. We produce total intensity and
spectral index mosaics of the region from 20 pointings (144 hours on-target in
total), covering 6.5 square degrees with an angular resolution of 4$""$,at a
central frequency of 1.28 GHz. Many new features are revealed for the first
time due to a combination of MeerKAT's high sensitivity, exceptional
$u,v$-plane coverage, and geographical vantage point. We highlight some initial
survey results, including new supernova remnant candidates, many new
non-thermal filament complexes, and enhanced views of the Radio Arc Bubble, Sgr
A and Sgr B regions. This project is a SARAO public legacy survey, and the
image products are made available with this article.

Title:A dusty veil shading Betelgeuse during its Great Dimming,"
Abstract:  Red supergiants are the most common final evolutionary stage of stars that
have initial masses between 8 and 35 times that of the Sun. During this stage,
which lasts roughly 100,000 years1, red supergiants experience substantial mass
loss. However, the mechanism for this mass loss is unknown. Mass loss may
affect the evolutionary path, collapse and future supernova light curve of a
red supergiant, and its ultimate fate as either a neutron star or a black hole.
From November 2019 to March 2020, Betelgeuse - the second-closest red
supergiant to Earth (roughly 220 parsecs, or 724 light years, away) -
experienced a historic dimming of its visible brightness. Usually having an
apparent magnitude between 0.1 and 1.0, its visual brightness decreased to
1.614 +/- 0.008 magnitudes around 7-13 February 2020 - an event referred to as
Betelgeuse's Great Dimming. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations
showing that the southern hemisphere of Betelgeuse was ten times darker than
usual in the visible spectrum during its Great Dimming. Observations and
modelling support a scenario in which a dust clump formed recently in the
vicinity of the star, owing to a local temperature decrease in a cool patch
that appeared on the photosphere. The directly imaged brightness variations of
Betelgeuse evolved on a timescale of weeks. Our findings suggest that a
component of mass loss from red supergiants is inhomogeneous, linked to a very
contrasted and rapidly changing photosphere

Title:Statistical Properties of the Population of the Galactic Center Filaments: The Spectral Index and Equipartition Magnetic Field,"
Abstract:  We present high-pass filtered continuum images of the inner
$3.5^\circ\times2.5^\circ$ of the Galactic center at 20 cm with $6.4''$
resolution. These mosaic images are taken with MeerKAT and reveal a large
number of narrow filaments, roughly an order of magnitude increase in their
numbers compared to past measurements. For the first time, we carry out
population studies of the spectral index and magnetic field of the entire
region. The mean spectral indices of the filaments are steeper than supernova
remnants (SNRs) (-0.62) with a value of $\alpha\sim-0.83$. The variation in
$\alpha$ is much larger than for the SNRs, suggesting that these
characteristics have a different origin. A large-scale cosmic-ray driven wind
has recently been proposed to explain the origin of filaments and the
large-scale 430 pc bipolar radio and X-ray structure. This favors the
possibility that the large-scale bipolar radio/X-ray structure is produced by
past activity of Sgr A* rather than coordinated burst of supernovae. A trend of
steeper indices is also noted with increasing distance from the Galactic plane.
This could be explained either by synchrotron cooling or weak shocks
accelerating cosmic-ray particles in the context of the cosmic-ray driven wind.
The mean magnetic field strengths along the filaments ranges from $\sim100$ to
400 $\mu$G depending on the assumed ratio of cosmic-ray protons to electrons.
Given that there is a high cosmic ray pressure in the Galactic center, the
large equipartition magnetic field implies that the magnetic field is weak in
most of the interstellar volume of the Galactic center.

Title:Subaru/HSC z-Broadband Excess Selection of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies at z<1,"
Abstract:  We present a search for extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at z<1 in the
COSMOS and North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) fields with imaging from Subaru/Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC) and a combination of new and existing spectroscopy. We select
EELGs on the basis of substantial excess flux in the z broadband, which is
sensitive to H$\alpha$ at 0.3<z<0.42 and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 at 0.7<z<0.86. We
identify 10,470 galaxies with z excesses in the COSMOS dataset and 91,385 in
the NEP field. We cross-reference the COSMOS EELG sample with the zCOSMOS and
DEIMOS 10k spectral catalogs, finding 1395 spectroscopic matches. We made an
additional 71 (46 unique) spectroscopic measurements with Y<23 using the HYDRA
multi-object spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m telescope, and 204 spectroscopic
measurements from the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck II telescope, providing a
total of 1441/10,470 spectroscopic redshifts for the EELG sample in COSMOS
(~14%). We confirm that 1418 (~98%) are H$\alpha$ or [OIII]$\lambda$5007
emitters in the above stated redshift ranges. We also identify 240 redshifted
H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emitters in the NEP using spectra taken with
WIYN/HYDRA and Keck/DEIMOS. Using broadband selection techniques in g-r-i color
space, we distinguish between H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emitters with
98.6% accuracy. We test our EELG selection by constructing H$\alpha$ and
[OIII]$\lambda$5007 luminosity functions and comparing to recent literature
results. We conclude that broadband magnitudes from HSC, the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory, and other deep optical multi-band surveys can be used to select
EELGs in a straightforward manner.

Title:Using AGN lightcurves to map accretion disc temperature fluctuations,"
Abstract:  We introduce a new model for understanding AGN continuum variability. We
start from a Shakura--Sunyaev thin accretion disc with a steady-state radial
temperature profile $T(R)$ and assume that the variable flux is due to
axisymmetric temperature perturbations $\delta T(R,t)$. After linearizing the
equations, we fit UV-optical AGN lightcurves to determine $\delta T(R,t)$ for a
sample of seven AGNs. We see a diversity of $|\delta T/T| \sim 0.1$ fluctuation
patterns which are not dominated by outgoing waves traveling at the speed of
light as expected for the ""lamppost"" model used to interpret disc reverberation
mapping studies. Rather, the most common pattern resembles slow ($v \ll c$)
ingoing waves. An explanation for our findings is that these ingoing waves
trigger central temperature fluctuations that act as a lamppost, producing
lower amplitude temperature fluctuations moving outwards at the speed of light.
The lightcurves are dominated by the lamppost signal -- even though the
temperature fluctuations are dominated by other structures with similar
variability time-scales -- because the discs exponentially smooth the
contributions from the slower moving ($v \ll c$) fluctuations to the observed
lightcurves. This leads to lightcurves that closely resemble the expectations
for a lamppost model but with the slow variability time-scales of the ingoing
waves. This also implies that longer time-scale variability signals will
increasingly diverge from lamppost models because the smoothing of
slower-moving waves steadily decreases as their period or spatial wavelength
increases.

Title:A Transparent Window into Early-Type Stellar Variability,"
Abstract:  Subsurface convection zones are ubiquitous in early-type stars. Driven by
narrow opacity peaks, these thin convective regions transport little heat but
play an important role in setting the magnetic properties and surface
variability of stars. Here we demonstrate that these convection zones are
\emph{not} present in as wide a range of stars as previously believed. In
particular, there are regions which 1D stellar evolution models report to be
convectively unstable but which fall below the critical Rayleigh number for
onset of convection. For sub-solar metallicity this opens up a \emph{stability
window} in which there are no subsurface convection zones. For LMC metallicity
this surface stability region extends roughly between $8M_\odot$ and
$16M_\odot$, increasing to $8M_\odot$ -- $35M_\odot$ for SMC metallicity. Such
windows are then an excellent target for probing the relative influence of
subsurface convection and other sources of photometric variability in massive
stars.

Title:Probing star formation and ISM properties using galaxy disk inclination III: Evolution in dust opacity and clumpiness between redshift 0.0 < z < 0.7 constrained from UV to NIR,"
Abstract:  (Abridged) In this paper, we use the Tuffs et al. attenuation - inclination
models in ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) bands to
investigate the average global dust properties in galaxies as a function of
stellar mass $M_{*}$, stellar mass surface density $\mu_{*}$, star-formation
rate $SFR$, specific star-formation rate $sSFR$, star-formation main-sequence
offset $dMS$, and star-formation rate surface density $\Sigma_{SFR}$ at
redshifts $z \sim 0$ and $z \sim 0.7$. We use star-forming galaxies from SDSS
($\sim$ 20000) and GAMA ($\sim$ 2000) to form our low-z sample at $0.04 < z <
0.1$ and star-forming galaxies from COSMOS ($\sim$ 2000) for the sample at $0.6
<z < 0.8$. We find that galaxies at $z \sim 0.7$ have higher optical depth
$\tau_{B}^{f}$ and clumpiness $F$ than galaxies at $z \sim 0$. The increase in
$F$ hints that the stars of $z \sim 0.7$ galaxies are less likely to escape
their birth cloud, which might indicate that the birth clouds are larger. We
also found that $\tau_{B}^{f}$ increases with $M_{*}$ and $\mu_{*}$independent
of sample and therefore redshift. We found no clear trends in $\tau_{B}^{f}$ or
$F$ with $SFR$, which could imply that the dust mass distribution is
independent of $SFR$. In turn, this would imply that the balance of dust
formation and destruction is independent of the $SFR$. Based on an analysis of
the inclination-dependence of the Balmer decrement, we find that reproducing
the Balmer line emission requires not only a completely optically thick dust
component associated with star forming regions, as in the standard Tuffs et al.
model, but an extra component of optically thin dust within the birth clouds.
This new component implies the existence of dust inside HII regions that
attenuates the Balmer emission before it escapes through gaps in the birth
cloud and we find it is more important in high-mass galaxies.

Title:Hunting for Massive Black Holes in Dwarf Galaxies,"
Abstract:  Despite traditional thinking, an appreciable population of massive black
holes may be lurking in dwarf galaxies. Prior to the last decade, nearly all
massive black holes were found in the nuclei of giant galaxies and the
existence of massive black holes in dwarf galaxies was highly controversial.
The field has now been transformed with a growing community of researchers
working on a variety of observational studies and theoretical models of dwarf
galaxies hosting massive black holes. Work in this area is not only important
for a holistic understanding of dwarf galaxy evolution and feedback, but it may
just tell us how the first ""seeds"" of massive black holes formed in the early
Universe. In this Perspective, I discuss the current state of the field as well
as future prospects. I also present new insights on the demographics of nearby
dwarf galaxies, which can be used to help constrain the black hole
occupation/active fraction as a function of mass and dwarf galaxy type.

Title:Constraining IGM enrichment and metallicity with the C IV forest correlation function,"
Abstract:  The production and distribution of metals in the diffuse intergalactic medium
(IGM) have implications for galaxy formation models and the baryon (re)cycling
process. The relative abundance of metals in high versus low-ionization states
has also been argued to be sensitive to the Universe's reionization history.
However, measurements of the background metallicity of the IGM at z~4 are
sparse and in poor agreement with one another, and reduced sensitivity in the
near-IR renders detecting individual metal absorbers nearly impossible. We
present a new clustering-based technique that enables the detection of these
weak IGM absorbers by statistically averaging over all spectral pixels, here
applied to the C IV forest. We simulate the z=4.5 IGM with different models of
inhomogeneous metal distributions and investigate its two-point correlation
function (2PCF) using mock skewers of the C IV forest. The 2PCF demonstrates a
clear peak at the doublet separation of the C IV line. The peak amplitude
scales quadratically with metallicity, while enrichment morphology affects both
the shape and amplitude of the 2PCF. The effect of enrichment topology can also
be framed in terms of the metal mass- and volume-filling factors, and we show
their trends as a function of the enrichment topology. For models consistent
with the distribution of metals at z~3, we find that we can constrain [C/H] to
within 0.2 dex, log$\,M_{\rm{min}}$ to within 0.4 dex, and $R$ to within 15%.
We show that strong absorbers arising from the circumgalactic medium of
galaxies can be easily identified and masked, allowing one to recover the
underlying IGM signal. The auto-correlation of the metal-line forest presents a
new and compelling avenue to simultaneously constrain IGM metallicity and
enrichment topology with high precision at z>4, thereby pushing such
measurements into the Epoch of Reionization.

Abstract:  We study the relationships between stellar mass, size and age within the
quiescent population, using two mass-complete spectroscopic samples with
$\mathrm{log_{10}}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})>10.3$, taken from VANDELS at
$1.0<z<1.3$, and LEGA-C at $0.6<z<0.8$. Using robust D$_{n}$4000 values, we
demonstrate that the well-known 'downsizing' signature is already in place by
$z\simeq1.1$, with D$_{n}$4000 increasing by $\simeq0.1$ across a $\simeq$ 1
dex mass interval for both VANDELS and LEGA-C. We then proceed to investigate
the evolution of the quiescent galaxy stellar mass-size relation from
$z\simeq1.1$ to $z\simeq0.7$. We find the median size increases by a factor of
$1.9\pm{0.1}$ at $\mathrm{log_{10}}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})=10.5$, and
see tentative evidence for flattening of the relation, finding slopes of
$\alpha=0.72\pm0.06$ and $\alpha=$ $0.56\pm0.04$ for VANDELS and LEGA-C
respectively. We finally split our sample into galaxies above and below our
fitted mass-size relations, to investigate how size and D$_{n}$4000 correlate.
For LEGA-C, we see a clear difference, with larger galaxies found to have
smaller D$_{n}$4000 at fixed stellar mass. Due to the faintness and smaller
numbers of the VANDELS sample, we cannot confirm whether a similar relation
exists at $z\simeq1.1$. We consider whether differences in stellar age or
metallicity are most likely to drive this size-D$_{n}$4000 relation, finding
that any metallicity differences are unlikely to fully explain the observed
offset, meaning smaller galaxies must be older than their larger counterparts.
We find the observed evolution in size, mass and D$_{n}$4000 across the
$\simeq2$ Gyr from $z\sim1.1$ to $z\sim0.7$ can be explained by a simple toy
model in which VANDELS galaxies evolve passively, whilst experiencing a series
of minor mergers.

Title:Ultra-short period contact binaries: restricting the parameters of the primary using Gaia parallax,"
Abstract:  Possible M-type contact binaries were investigated by selecting W UMa-type
variables with orbital periods below the 0.22-day cutoff. Gaia parallaxes were
combined with Gaia and 2MASS photometry to obtain G and J-band absolute
magnitudes of 674 red variable stars catalogued as contact binaries in the VSX
database. The absolute magnitude of main sequence cool dwarfs varies strongly
with spectral type, which was used to create a selection of 218 systems with
primaries potentially of spectral types M0-M3. Lightcurves of the 46 systems
with lowest near-infrared luminosities were inspected individually to confirm
or reject the W UMa classification where possible. The extinction limits and
amplitudes were combined with the calculated absolute magnitudes in order to
set upper limits for the masses of the primary components. This is achieved via
the consideration that the luminosity of the primary is no less than that of a
main sequence star of the same mass. For 26 possible contact binaries the mass
of the primary was limited to less than 0.5 solar masses with some systems
having upper limits for the primary as low as 0.35 solar masses. These rare
systems are intriguing targets for more detailed observations since they are on
the low-mass end of the contact binary distribution and their formation and
evolution are still unclear.

Title:The EXPRES Stellar Signals Project II. State of the Field in Disentangling Photospheric Velocities,"
Abstract:  Measured spectral shifts due to intrinsic stellar variability (e.g.,
pulsations, granulation) and activity (e.g., spots, plages) are the largest
source of error for extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) exoplanet
detection. Several methods are designed to disentangle stellar signals from
true center-of-mass shifts due to planets. The EXPRES Stellar Signals Project
(ESSP) presents a self-consistent comparison of 22 different methods tested on
the same extreme-precision spectroscopic data from EXPRES. Methods derived new
activity indicators, constructed models for mapping an indicator to the needed
RV correction, or separated out shape- and shift-driven RV components. Since no
ground truth is known when using real data, relative method performance is
assessed using the total and nightly scatter of returned RVs and agreement
between the results of different methods. Nearly all submitted methods return a
lower RV RMS than classic linear decorrelation, but no method is yet
consistently reducing the RV RMS to sub-meter-per-second levels. There is a
concerning lack of agreement between the RVs returned by different methods.
These results suggest that continued progress in this field necessitates
increased interpretability of methods, high-cadence data to capture stellar
signals at all timescales, and continued tests like the ESSP using consistent
data sets with more advanced metrics for method performance. Future comparisons
should make use of various well-characterized data sets -- such as solar data
or data with known injected planetary and/or stellar signals -- to better
understand method performance and whether planetary signals are preserved.

Title:Gravitational Wave Statistics for Pulsar Timing Arrays: Examining Bias from Using a Finite Number of Pulsars,"
Abstract:  Recently, many different pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have
reported strong evidence for a common stochastic process in their data sets.
The reported amplitudes are in tension with previously computed upper limits.
In this paper, we investigate how using a subset of a set of pulsars biases
Bayesian upper limit recovery. We generate 500 simulated PTA data sets based on
the NANOGrav 11-year data set with an injected stochastic gravitational wave
background (GWB). We then compute upper limits by sampling individual pulsar
likelihoods, and combine them through a factorized version of the PTA
likelihood to obtain upper limits on the GWB amplitude using different numbers
of pulsars. We find that it is possible to recover an upper limit (95\%
credible interval) \textit{below} the injected value, and that it is
significantly more likely for this to occur when using a subset of pulsars to
compute the upper limit. When picking pulsars to induce the maximum possible
bias, we find that the 95\% Bayesian upper limit recovered is below the
injected value in 10.6\% (53 of 500) of realizations. Further, we find that if
we choose a subset of pulsars in order to obtain a lower upper limit than when
using the full set of pulsars, the distribution of upper limits obtained from
these 500 realizations is shifted to lower amplitude values.

explosive devices (NED) in the penetrators, combined with soon-to-be-realized
heavy lift launch assets with positive $C_3$ such as NASA SLS or SpaceX
Starship (with in-orbit refueling) is sufficient to mitigate this existential
threat. A threat of this magnitude hitting the Earth at a closing speed of 40
km/s for the comet and 20 km/s for the asteroid would have an impact energy of
roughly 65 Teratons TNT, or about ten thousand times larger than the current
combined nuclear arsenal of the entire world. This is similar in energy to the
KT extinction event that killed the dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. Such
an event, if not mitigated, would be an existential threat to humanity. We show
that mitigation is conceivable using existing technology, even with the short
time scale of 6 months warning, but that the efficient coupling of the NED
energy is critical.

"Title:The emptiness inside: Finding gaps, valleys, and lacunae with geometric data analysis","
Abstract:  Discoveries of gaps in data have been important in astrophysics. For example,
there are kinematic gaps opened by resonances in dynamical systems, or
exoplanets of a certain radius that are empirically rare. A gap in a data set
is a kind of anomaly, but in an unusual sense: Instead of being a single
outlier data point, situated far from other data points, it is a region of the
space, or a set of points, that is anomalous compared to its surroundings. Gaps
are both interesting and hard to find and characterize, especially when they
have non-trivial shapes. We present in this paper a statistic that can be used
to estimate the (local) ""gappiness"" of a point in the data space. It uses the
gradient and Hessian of the density estimate (and thus requires a
twice-differentiable density estimator). This statistic can be computed at
(almost) any point in the space and does not rely on optimization; it allows to
highlight under-dense regions of any dimensionality and shape in a general and
efficient way. We illustrate our method on the velocity distribution of nearby
stars in the Milky Way disk plane, which exhibits gaps that could originate
from different processes. Identifying and characterizing those gaps could help
determine their origins. We provide in an Appendix implementation notes and
additional considerations for finding under-densities in data, using critical
points and the properties of the Hessian of the density.

attenuating factor of 1.25x10$^{4}$, which produces crosstalk ghosts with an
average signal-to-noise ratio of 0.64$\pm$0.1 on the bright images. We find no
evidence of crosstalk signals between CCDs not connected in the hardware setup.
The distribution of attenuation factors is also found to be dependent on
crosstalk movement. A clear dependence on cell column offsets is found,
consistent with the idea that the source star charge is progressively
attenuated during the traversal of cell readout lines. While we can see the
trends, the uncertainties on aperture magnitude measurements are large at this
stage.

Title:The Hierarchical Structure of Galactic Haloes: Generalised N-Dimensional Clustering with CluSTAR-ND,"
Abstract:  We present CluSTAR-ND, a fast hierarchical galaxy/(sub)halo finder that
produces {\bf Clu}stering {\bf S}tructure via {\bf T}ransformative {\bf
A}ggregation and {\bf R}ejection in {\bf N}-{\bf D}imensions. It is designed to
improve upon Halo-OPTICS -- an algorithm that automatically detects and
extracts significant astrophysical clusters from the 3D spatial positions of
simulation particles -- by decreasing run-times, possessing the capability for
metric adaptivity, and being readily applicable to data with any number of
features. We directly compare these algorithms and find that not only does
CluSTAR-ND produce a similarly robust clustering structure, it does so in a
run-time that is at least $3$ orders of magnitude faster. In optimising
CluSTAR-ND's clustering performance, we have also carefully calibrated $4$ of
the $7$ CluSTAR-ND parameters which -- unless specified by the user -- will be
automatically and optimally chosen based on the input data. We conclude that
CluSTAR-ND is a robust astrophysical clustering algorithm that can be leveraged
to find stellar satellite groups on large synthetic or observational data sets.

"Title:Eviction-like resonances for satellite orbits. Application to Phobos, the main satellite of Mars","
Abstract:  The motion of a satellite can experience secular resonances between the
precession frequencies of its orbit and the mean motion of the host planet
around the star. Some of these resonances can significantly modify the
eccentricity (evection resonance) and the inclination (eviction resonance) of
the satellite. In this paper, we study in detail the secular resonances that
can disturb the orbit of a satellite, in particular the eviction-like ones.
Although the inclination is always disturbed while crossing one eviction-like
resonance, capture can only occur when the semi-major axis is decreasing. This
is, for instance, the case of Phobos, the largest satellite of Mars, that will
cross some of these resonances in the future because its orbit is shrinking
owing to tidal effects. We estimate the impact of resonance crossing in the
orbit of the satellite, including the capture probabilities, as a function of
several parameters, such as the eccentricity and the inclination of the
satellite, and the obliquity of the planet. Finally, we use the method of the
frequency map analysis to study the resonant dynamics based on stability maps,
and we show that some of the secular resonances may overlap, which leads to
chaotic motion for the inclination of the satellite.

Title:Characterizing Beam Errors for Radio Interferometric Observations of Reionization,"
Abstract:  A limiting systematic effect in 21-cm interferometric experiments is the
chromaticity due to the coupling between the sky and the instrument. This
coupling is sourced by the instrument primary beam; therefore it is important
to know the beam to extremely high precision. Here we demonstrate how known
beam uncertainties can be characterized using databases of beam models. In this
introductory work, we focus on beam errors arising from physically offset
and/or broken antennas within a station. We use the public code OSKAR to
generate an ""ideal"" SKA beam formed from 256 antennas regularly-spaced in a
35-m circle, as well as a large database of ""perturbed"" beams sampling
distributions of broken/offset antennas. We decompose the beam errors (""ideal""
minus ""perturbed"") using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel PCA
(KPCA). Using 20 components, we find that PCA/KPCA can reduce the residual of
the beam in our datasets by 60-90% compared with the assumption of an ideal
beam. Using a simulated observation of the cosmic signal plus foregrounds, we
find that assuming the ideal beam can result in 1% error in the EoR window and
10% in the wedge of the 2D power spectrum. When PCA/KPCA is used to
characterize the beam uncertainties, the error in the power spectrum shrinks to
below 0.01% in the EoR window and <1% in the wedge. Our framework can be used
to characterize and then marginalize over uncertainties in the beam for robust
next-generation 21-cm parameter estimation.

Title:High energy neutrinos from fast winds in Novae,"
Abstract:  We discuss a scenario in which TeV neutrinos are produced during explosions
of Novae. It is argued that hadrons are accelerated to very high energies in
the inner part of a Nova wind, as a result of reconnection of the strong
magnetic field of a White Dwarf. Hadrons are expected to interact efficiently
with a dense matter of the wind, either already during the acceleration process
or during their advection with the equatorial wind. We calculate the neutrino
spectra, and estimate the muon neutrino event rates in the IceCube telescope,
in the case of a few Novae. In general, those event rates are unlikely to be
detected with the present neutrino detectors. However, for favourable location
of the observer, some neutrino events might be detected not only from the class
of Novae recently detected in the GeV $\gamma$-rays by the {\it Fermi}-LAT
telescope but also from novae not detected in $\gamma$-rays. The GeV
$\gamma$-ray emission observed from Novae cannot originate in terms of the
model discussed here, since protons are accelerated within a few stellar radii
of the White dwarf, i.e. in the region in which GeV $\gamma$-rays are expected
to be severely absorbed in the interactions with the radiation field and the
matter of the wind.

Title:A Tight Three-parameter Correlation and Related Classification on Gamma-Ray Bursts,"
Abstract:  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are widely believed to be from massive collapsars
and/or compact binary mergers, which accordingly, would generate long and short
GRBs, respectively. The details on this classification scheme have been in
constant debate given more and more observational data available to us. In this
work, we apply a series of data mining methods to studying the potential
classification information contained in the prompt emission of GRBs detected by
the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. A tight global correlation is found between
fluence ($f$), peak flux ($F$) and prompt duration ($T_{90}$) which takes the
form of $ \log {\it f}= 0.75 \log T_{90} +0.92 \log F -7.14$. Based on this
correlation, we can define a new parameter $L = 1.66\log T_{90} + 0.84 \log
{\it f} - 0.46 \log F + 3.24$ by linear discriminant analysis that would
distinguish between long and short GRBs with much less ambiguity than $T_{90}$.
We also discussed the three subclasses scheme of GRB classification derived
from clusters analysis based on a Gaussian mixture model, and suggest that,
besides SGRBs, LGRBs may be divided into long-bright gamma-ray bursts (LBGRBs)
and long-faint gamma-ray bursts (LFGRBs), LBGRBs have statistical higher $f$
and $F$ than LFGRBs; further statistical analysis found that LBGRBs also have
higher number of GRB pulses than LFGRBs.

Title:Quantum mechanical simulations of the radical-radical chemistry on icy surfaces,"
Abstract:  The formation of the interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) is a hot
topic in astrochemistry. One of the main paradigms trying to reproduce the
observations postulates that iCOMs are formed on the ice mantles covering the
interstellar dust grains as a result of radical--radical coupling reactions.
We investigate iCOMs formation on the icy surfaces by means of computational
quantum mechanical methods. In particular, we study the coupling and direct
hydrogen abstraction reactions involving the CH$_3$ + X systems (X = NH$_2$,
CH$_3$, HCO, CH$_3$O, CH$_2$OH) and HCO + Y (Y = HCO, CH$_3$O, CH$_2$OH), plus
the CH$_2$OH + CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$O + CH$_3$O systems.
We computed the activation energy barriers of these reactions as well as the
binding energies of all the studied radicals, by means of density functional
theory (DFT) calculations on two ice water models, made of 33 and 18 water
molecules. Then, we estimated the efficiency of each reaction using the
reaction activation, desorption and diffusion energies and derived kinetics
with the Eyring equations.
We find that radical--radical chemistry on surfaces is not as straightforward
as usually assumed. In some cases, direct H abstraction reactions can compete
with radical--radical couplings, while in others they may contain large
activation energies. Specifically, we found that (i) ethane, methylamine and
ethylene glycol are the only possible products of the relevant radical--radical
reactions; (ii) glyoxal, methyl formate, glycolaldehyde, formamide, dimethyl
ether and ethanol formation is likely in competition with the respective
H-abstraction products, and (iii) acetaldehyde and dimethyl peroxide do not
seem a likely grain surface products.

Title:Gravitational lensing effects of supermassive black holes in cluster environments,"
Abstract:  This study explores the gravitational lensing effects of supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) in galaxy clusters. While the presence of central SMBHs in
galaxies is firmly established, recent work from high-resolution simulations
predict the existence of an additional population of wandering SMBHs. Though
the masses of these SMBHs are a minor perturbation on the larger scale and
individual galaxy scale dark matter components in the cluster, they can impact
statistical lensing properties and individual lensed image configurations.
Probing for these potentially observable signatures, we find that SMBHs imprint
detectable signatures in rare, higher-order strong lensing image configurations
although they do not manifest any statistically significant detectable evidence
in either the magnification distribution or the integrated shear profile.
Investigating specific lensed image geometries, we report that a massive, near
point-like, potential of an SMBH causes the following detectable effects: (ii)
image splitting leading to the generation of extra images; (ii) positional and
magnification asymmetries in multiply imaged systems; and (iii) the apparent
disappearance of a lensed counter-image. Of these, image splitting inside the
cluster tangential critical curve, is the most prevalent notable observational
signature. We demonstrate these possibilities in two cases of observed giant
arcs in $SGAS\,J003341.5+024217$ and $RX\,J1347.5-1145$, wherein specific image
configurations seen can be reproduced with SMBHs. Future observations with
high-resolution instrumentation (e.g. MAVIS-Very Large Telescope,
MICADO-Extremely Large Telescope, and the upgraded ngVLA, along with data from
the \textit{Euclid} \& \textit{Nancy Grace Roman} Space Telescopes and the
Rubin LSST Observatory are likely to allow us to probe these unique yet rare
SMBHs lensing signatures.

Title:Operating Spacecraft Around Comets: Evaluation of the Near-Nucleus Environment,"
Abstract:  We present a study of the current state of knowledge concerning spacecraft
operations and potential hazards while operating near a comet nucleus. Starting
from simple calculations comparing the cometary coma environment to benign
conditions on Earth, we progress to sophisticated engineering models of
spacecraft behavior, and then confront these models with recent spacecraft
proximity operations experience. Finally, we make recommendations from lessons
learned for future spacecraft missions that enter into orbit around a comet for
long-term operations. All of these considerations indicate that, with a proper
spacecraft design and operations planning, the near-nucleus environment can be
a relatively safe region in which to operate, even for an active short period
comet near perihelion with gas production rates as high as 1e29 molecules/s.
With gas densities similar to those found in good laboratory vacuums, dust
densities similar to Class 100 cleanrooms, dust particle velocities of 10s of
m/s, and microgravity forces that permit slow and deliberate operations, the
conditions around a comet are generally more benign than a typical day on Mars.
Even in strong dust jets near the nucleus surface, dust densities tend to be
only a few grains/cm3, about the same as in a typical interior room on Earth.
Stochastic forces on a modern spacecraft with tens of square meters of
projected surface area can be accounted for using modern Attitude Control
Systems to within tens of meters navigation error; surface contamination issues
are only important for spacecraft spending months to years within a few
kilometers of the nucleus surface; and the issues the Rosetta spacecraft faced,
confusion of celestial star trackers by sunlit dust particles flying past the
spacecraft, will be addressed using the next generation of star trackers
implementing improved transient rejection algorithms.

Title:Metallicity distribution of the progenitor of the Giant Stellar Stream in the Andromeda Galaxy,"
Abstract:  The Giant Stellar Stream (GSS) is a prominent tidal feature in the halo of
the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), representing the ongoing destruction of a satellite
galaxy. In this paper, we investigate the formation of the GSS through detailed
numerical simulations of the tidal disruption of a progenitor system. Assuming
that the stream was created in a single merger event between M31 and a dwarf
spheroidal galaxy with stellar mass of $10^{9}M_{\odot}$, we successfully
reproduce the dynamical properties of the GSS. As the metallicity distribution
along the stream has been well determined from the observations (PAndAS and
AMIGA data sets), we use Monte Carlo simulations to reconstruct the original
metallicity distribution of the dwarf progenitor. We find that a progenitor
dwarf galaxy with a negative radial metallicity gradient, $\Delta$FeH = -$0.3
\pm 0.2$, reproduces the observed GSS properties at a time between 2.4 and 2.9
Gyrs into the merger. We also show that the observed double peak metallicity
distribution along the stream is a transitory structure caused by unique merger
circumstances where two groups of streaming stars are moving in opposite
directions, intersecting to produce the peaks.

Title:The structure of accreted stellar streams,"
Abstract:  Many of the Milky Way's globular clusters are likely accreted from satellite
galaxies that have long since merged with the Milky Way. When these globular
clusters are susceptible to tidal disruption, this process likely starts
already inside the parent satellite leading to an early stellar stream within
the satellite. When the parent satellite merges with the Milky Way, the
globular cluster and its pre-merger stellar stream are accreted in a somewhat
chaotic process. Here, we investigate the properties of the accreted stream
after the merger as we would see it today using a suite of simulations of
accretion events. We find that the accretion process leads to a wide range of
behaviors, but generally scatters the accreted stream over a wide,
two-dimensional area of the sky. The behavior ranges from a set of a few or
more well-defined ""sub-streams"" extending out from the post-merger thin stream
by tens of degrees, to more widely dispersed debris over much of the sky,
depending on how close to the center of the MilkyWay the merger happened. Using
mock Gaia-like observations of the simulated streams, we demonstrate that an
accreted-stream component can explain the off-track features observed in the
GD-1 stream. Sub-streams can appear like thin tidal streams themselves that are
seemingly unassociated with the post-merger stream, raising the possibility
that some of the progenitor-less streams observed in the Milky Way are part of
a single or a few accreted streams created in an ancient merger event.

Title:Discovery of late-time X-ray flare and anomalous emission line enhancement after the nuclear optical outburst in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxy,"
Abstract:  CSS J102913+404220 is a peculiar narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy with an
energetic nuclear optical outburst. We present a detailed analysis of its
multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations covering a period
of decade since outburst. We detect mid-infrared (MIR) flares delayed by about
two months relative to the optical outburst, with an extremely high peak
luminosity of log(L_4.6um)>44 erg/s. The MIR peak luminosity is at least an
order of magnitude higher than any known supernovae explosions, suggesting the
optical outburst might be due to a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE). We
find late-time X-ray brightening by a factor of >30 with respect to what is
observed about 100 days after the optical outburst peak, followed by a flux
fading by a factor of ~4 within two weeks, making it one of Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGNs) with extreme variability. Despite the dramatic X-ray variability,
there are no coincident strong flux variations in optical, UV and MIR bands.
This unusual variability behavior has been seen in other highly accreting AGNs
and could be attributed to absorption variability. In this scenario, the
decrease in the covering factor of absorber with accretion rate could cause the
X-ray brightening, possibly induced by the TDE. Most strikingly, while the
UV/optical continuum remains little changes with time, an evident enhancement
in the flux of H_alpha broad emission line is observed, about a decade after
the nuclear optical outburst, which is an anomalous behavior never seen in any
other AGNs. Such an H_alpha anomaly could be explained by the replenishment of
gas clouds and excitation within Broad Line Region (BLR) that originates,
perhaps from the interaction of outflowing stellar debris with BLR. The results
highlight the importance of late-time evolution of TDE that could affect the
accreting properties of AGN, as suggested by recent simulations.

Title:Response of the Fe K_alpha line emission to the X-ray continuum variability in the changing-look active galactic nucleus NGC 1566,"
Abstract:  NGC 1566 is a changing look AGN known to exhibit recurrent X-ray outbursts
with each lasting for several years. The most recent X-ray outburst is observed
on 2018, with a substantial increase of 2--10 keV flux by a factor of ~24 than
the historical minimum. We re-analyze the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations
covering the pre-outburst, outburst and post-outburst epochs, and confirm the
discovery of the broad feature in the ~5--7 keV band during the period of
outburst that could be interpreted as a relativistic Fe K_alpha emission line.
Our analysis suggests that its flux has increased in tandem with the 2--10 keV
continuum, making it the second changing look AGN in which the broad Fe K_alpha
line responds to the X-ray continuum variability. This behavior strongly
supports the idea that X-rays originates in a corona above the accretion disk,
and disk reflection produces the relativistic Fe K_alpha line. In addition, we
find the response of narrow Fe K_alpha emission line to the changes in the
X-ray continuum on a time-scale as short as four months, allowing to put the
location of line-emitting region at <0.1 pc, comparable to the size of optical
BLR. By comparing to the changing look AGN NGC 2992, the Fe K_alpha variation
rate (the ratio of Fe K_alpha variation to luminosity variation) in NGC 1566
appears greater, which could be possibly explained by larger amount of gas or
Fe abundance responsible for producing the Fe K_alpha line for the latter. The
strength of variable broad Fe K_alpha line as well as the soft X-ray excess
emission appears to be correlated with the accretion rate, which could be
explained as due to the state transition associated with the changing-look
phenomenon.

Title:Massive Black Hole Binaries from the TNG50-3 Simulation: I. Coalescence and LISA Detection Rates,"
Abstract:  We evaluate the cosmological coalescence and detection rates for massive
black hole (MBH) binaries targeted by the gravitational wave observatory Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Our calculation starts with a population
of gravitationally unbound MBH pairs, drawn from the TNG50-3 cosmological
simulation, and follows their orbital evolution from kpc scales all the way to
coalescence using a semi-analytic model developed in our previous work. We find
that for a majority of MBH pairs that coalesce within a Hubble time dynamical
friction is the most important mechanism that determines their coalescence
rate. Our model predicts a MBH coalescence rate < 0.45/ yr and a LISA detection
rate < 0.34/ yr. Most LISA detections should originate from 10^6 - 10^6.8 solar
masses MBHs in gas-rich galaxies at redshifts 1.6 < z < 2.4, and have a
characteristic signal to noise ratio SNR ~ 100. We however find a dramatic
reduction in the coalescence and detection rates, as well as the average SNR,
if the effects of radiative feedback from accreting MBHs are taken into
account. In this case, the MBH coalescence rate is reduced by 78% (to < 0.1/
yr), and the LISA detection rate is reduced by 94% (to 0.02/ yr), whereas the
average SNR is ~ 10. We emphasize that our model provides a lower limit on the
LISA detection rate, consistent with other works in the literature that draw
their MBH pairs from cosmological simulations.

Title:The VISCACHA survey -- IV. The SMC West Halo in 8D,"
Abstract:  The structure of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is very complex, in
particular in the periphery that suffers more from the interactions with the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). A wealth of observational evidence has been
accumulated revealing tidal tails and bridges made up of gas, stars and star
clusters. Nevertheless, a full picture of the SMC outskirts is only recently
starting to emerge with a 6D phase-space map plus age and metallicity using
star clusters as tracers. In this work, we continue our analysis of another
outer region of the SMC, the so-called West Halo, and combined it with the
previously analysed Northern Bridge. We use both structures to define the
Bridge and Counter-bridge trailing and leading tidal tails. These two
structures are moving away from each other, roughly in the SMC-LMC direction.
The West Halo form a ring around the SMC inner regions that goes up to the
background of the Northern Bridge shaping an extended layer of the
Counter-bridge. Four old Bridge clusters were identified at distances larger
than 8 kpc from the SMC centre moving towards the LMC, which is consistent with
the SMC-LMC closest distance of 7.5 kpc when the Magellanic Bridge was formed
about 150Myr ago; this shows that the Magellanic Bridge was not formed only by
pulled gas, but it also removed older stars from the SMC during its formation.
We also found age and metallicity radial gradients using projected distances on
sky, which are vanished when we use the real 3D distances.

suite of constrained Local Group (LG) simulations. The HESTIA suite comprise of
a set of three high-resolution {\sc arepo}-based simulations of the LG, run
using the Auriga galaxy formation model. For this paper, we focus only on the
$z = 0$ simulation datasets and generate mock skymaps along with a power
spectrum analysis to show that the distributions of ions tracing
low-temperature gas (HI and SiIII) are more clumpy in comparison to warmer gas
tracers (OVI, OVII and OVIII). We compare to the spectroscopic CGM observations
of M31 and low-redshift galaxies. HESTIA under-produces the column densities of
the M31 observations, but the simulations are consistent with the observations
of low-redshift galaxies. A possible explanation for these findings is that the
spectroscopic observations of M31 are contaminated by gas residing in the CGM
of the Milky Way.

Title:Project Hephaistos I. Upper limits on partial Dyson spheres in the Milky Way,"
Abstract:  Dyson spheres are hypothetical megastructures built by advanced
extraterrestrial civilizations to harvest radiation energy from stars. Here, we
combine optical data from Gaia DR2 with mid-infrared data from AllWISE to set
the strongest upper limits to date on the prevalence of partial Dyson spheres
within the Milky Way, based on their expected waste-heat signatures.
Conservative upper limits are presented on the fraction of stars at G $\leq$ 21
that may potentially host non-reflective Dyson spheres that absorb 1 - 90$\%$
of the bolometric luminosity of their host stars and emit thermal waste-heat in
the 100 - 1000 K range. Based on a sample of $\approx$ $2.7\mathrm{e}\,5$ stars
within 100 pc, we find that a fraction less than $\approx$ $2\mathrm{e}\,-5$
could potentially host $\sim$300 K Dyson spheres at 90$\%$ completion. These
limits become progressively weaker for less complete Dyson spheres due to
increased confusion with naturally occurring sources of strong mid-infrared
radiation, and also at larger distances, due to the detection limits of WISE.
For the $\sim2.9\mathrm{e}\,8$ stars within 5 kpc in our Milky Way sample, the
corresponding upper limit on the fraction of stars that could potentially be
$\sim$300 K Dyson spheres at 90$\%$ completion is $\leq$ $8\mathrm{e}\,-4$.

Title:Rapid Mass Parameter Estimation of Binary Black Hole Coalescences Using Deep Learning,"
Abstract:  Deep learning can be used to drastically decrease the processing time of
parameter estimation for coalescing binaries of compact objects including black
holes and neutron stars detected in gravitational waves (GWs). As a first step,
we present two neural network models trained to rapidly estimate the posterior
distributions of the chirp mass and mass ratio of a detected binary black hole
system from the GW strain data of LIGO Hanford and Livingston Observatories.
Using these parameters the component masses can be predicted, which has
implications for the prediction of the likelihood that a merger contains a
neutron star. The results are compared to the 'gold standard' of parameter
estimation of gravitational waves used by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration (LVC),
LALInference. Our models predict posterior distributions consistent with that
from LALInference while using orders of magnitude less processing time once the
models are trained. The median predictions are within the 90% credible
intervals of LALInference for all predicted parameters when tested on real
binary black hole events detected during the LVC's first and second observing
runs. We argue that deep learning has strong potential for low-latency
high-accuracy parameter estimation suitable for real-time GW search pipelines.

Title:Cosmological perturbations: non-cold relics without the Boltzmann hierarchy,"
Abstract:  We present a formulation of cosmological perturbation theory where the
Boltzmann hierarchies that evolve the neutrino phase-space distributions are
replaced by integrals that can be evaluated easily with fast Fourier
transforms. The simultaneous evaluation of these integrals combined with the
differential equations for the rest of the system (dark matter, photons,
baryons) are then solved with an iterative scheme that converges quickly. The
formulation is particularly powerful for massive neutrinos, where the effective
phase space is three-dimensional rather than two-dimensional, and even moreso
for three different neutrino mass eigenstates. Therefore, it has the potential
to significantly speed up the computation times of cosmological-perturbation
calculations. This approach should also be applicable to models with other

five-band spectral energy distributions into variable (disc) and non-variable
(host galaxy) components. In modelling the disc spectra, we include attenuation
by dust on the line of sight through the host galaxy to its nucleus. We
consider five commonly used attenuation laws, and find that the best
description is by dust similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud, inferring
a lack of carbonaceous grains from the relatively weak 2175AA absorption
feature. We go on to construct a composite spectrum for the quasar variations
spanning 700 to 8000AA. By varying the assumed power-law
$L_{\nu}\propto\nu^\alpha$ spectral slope, we find a best-fit value
$\alpha=0.71\pm0.02$, excluding at high confidence the canonical
$L_{\nu}\propto\nu^{1/3}$ prediction for a steady-state accretion disc with a
$T\propto r^{-3/4}$ temperature profile. The bluer spectral index of the
observed quasar variations instead supports the model of Mummery & Balbus in
which a steeper temperature profile, $T\propto r^{-7/8}$, develops as a result
of finite magnetically-induced stress at the innermost stable circular orbit
extracting energy and angular momentum from the black hole spin.

"Title:HOLISMOKES. VIII. High-redshift, strong-lens search in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program","
Abstract:  We carry out a search for strong-lens systems containing high-redshift lens
galaxies with the goal of extending strong-lensing-assisted galaxy evolutionary
studies to earlier cosmic time. Two strong-lens classifiers are constructed
from a deep residual network and trained with datasets of different
lens-redshift and brightness distributions. We classify a sample of 5,356,628
pre-selected objects from the Wide-layer fields in the second public data
release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) by applying
the two classifiers to their HSC $gri$-filter cutouts. Cutting off at
thresholds that correspond to a false positive rate of $10^{-3}$ on our test
set, the two classifiers identify 5,468 and 6,119 strong-lens candidates.
Visually inspecting the cutouts of those candidates results in 735 grade-A or B
strong-lens candidates in total, of which 277 candidates are discovered for the
first time. This is the single largest set of galaxy-scale strong-lens
candidates discovered with HSC data to date, and nearly half of it (331/735)
contains lens galaxies with photometric redshifts above 0.6. Our discoveries
will serve as a valuable target list for ongoing and scheduled spectroscopic
surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the Subaru Prime
Focus Spectrograph project, and the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer.

"Title:Compact objects formation, retention, and growth through accretion onto gas-embedded white-dwarfs/neutron-stars in gas-enriched globular-clusters","
Abstract:  Observations of pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) give evidence that more
>10-20% of neutron stars (NSs) ever formed in GCs were retained there. However,
the velocity distribution of field pulsars peaks at 5-10 times the escape
velocities of GCs. Consequently, only a small fraction of GC-NSs should have
been retained, even accounting for low-velocity NSs formed through
electron-capture supernovae. Thus, too few low-velocity NSs should have been
retained in GCs, giving rise to the NS retention problem in GCs. Here we
suggest a novel solution, in which the progenitors of most GC-NSs were ONe
white-dwarfs (WDs) that accreted ambient intra-cluster gas and formed
low-velocity NSs through accretion induced collapse (AIC). The existence of an
early gas-enriched environment in GCs is supported by observations of GC
multiple stellar populations. It is thought that 10s-100s of Myrs after the
formation of the first generation of stars, and after ONe-WDs were already
formed, GCs were replenished with gas which formed a second generation of
stars. Accretion of such replenished gas onto the ONe-WDs catalyzed the AIC
processes. The number of AIC-formed NSs is then sufficient to explain the large
number of NSs retained in GCs. Similar processes might also drive CO-WDs to
produce type-Ia SNe or to merge and form NSs, and similarly drive NSs to AIC
and mergers producing BHs. Moreover, the wide variety of gas-catalyzed binary
mergers and explosive transients suggest to occur in the gas-rich environments
of AGN disk could similarly, and even more efficiently, occur in
second-generation gas in GCs.

Title:Constraints on the X-ray Luminosity Function of AGN at z=5.7-6.4 with the Extragalactic Serendipitous Swift Survey,"
Abstract:  X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) trace the
growth and evolution of supermassive black hole populations across cosmic time,
however, current XLF models are poorly constrained at redshifts of z>6. In this
work we constrain the bright-end of the XLF at z=5.7-6.4 using high-redshift
AGN identified within the Extragalactic Serendipitous Swift Survey (ExSeSS)
catalogue. Within ExSeSS we find one serendipitously detected X-ray selected
z>6 AGN, ATLAS J025.6821-33.4627, with an X-ray luminosity of
$L_\mathrm{X}=8.47^{+3.40}_{-3.13}\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and
z=6.31$\pm$0.03 making it the highest redshift, spectroscopically confirmed,
serendipitously detected X-ray selected quasar known to date. We also calculate
an upper limit on the space density at higher luminosities where no additional
sources are found, enabling us to place constraints on the shape of the XLF.
Our results are consistent with the rapid decline in the space densities of
high-luminosity AGN toward high redshift as predicted by extrapolations of
existing parametric models of the XLF. We also find that our X-ray based
measurements are consistent with estimates of the bolometric quasar luminosity
function based on UV measurements at $z\gtrsim6$, although they require a large
X-ray to bolometric correction factor (i.e. AGN that are relatively X-ray weak)
at these high luminosities.

Title:Non-star-forming molecular gas in the Abell 1367 intra-cluster multiphase orphan cloud,"
Abstract:  We report the detection of CO emission in the recently discovered multiphase
isolated gas cloud in the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 1367. The cloud is
located about 800 kpc in projection from the center of the cluster and at a
projected distance of > 80 kpc from any galaxy. It is the first and the only
known isolated intra-cluster cloud detected in X-ray, H$\alpha$, and CO
emission. We found a total of about $2.2\times 10^8 M_\odot$ of H$_2$ with the
IRAM 30-m telescope in two regions, one associated with the peak of H$\alpha$
emission and another with the peak of X-ray emission surrounded by weak
H$\alpha$ filaments. The velocity of the molecular gas is offset from the
underlying H$\alpha$ emission by > 100 km s$^{-1}$ in the region where the
X-ray peaks. The molecular gas may account for about 10% of the total cloud's
mass, which is dominated by the hot X-ray component. The previously measured
upper limit on the star formation rate in the cloud indicates that the
molecular component is in a non-star-forming state, possibly due to a
combination of low density of the gas and the observed level of velocity
dispersion. The presence of the three gas phases associated with the cloud
suggests that gas phase mixing with the surrounding intra-cluster medium is
taking place. The possible origin of the orphan cloud is a late evolutionary
stage of a ram pressure stripping event. In contrast, the nearby ram pressure
stripped galaxy 2MASX J11443212+2006238 is in an early phase of stripping and
we detected about $2.4\times 10^9 M_\odot$ of H$_2$ in its main body.

MuTe also discriminates inverse-trajectory and low-momentum muons by using a
picosecond Time-of-Flight system. We also characterise the instrument's
structural (mechanical and thermal) behaviour, discussing preliminary results
from the background composition and the telescope-health monitoring variables.
Finally, we discuss the implementations of an optimisation algorithm to improve
the volcano internal density distribution estimation and machine learning

Title:Classifying IGR J18007-4146 as an intermediate polar using XMM and NuSTAR,"
Abstract:  Many new and unidentified Galactic sources have recently been revealed by
ongoing hard X-ray surveys. A significant fraction of these have been shown to
be the type of accreting white dwarfs known as cataclysmic variables (CVs).
Follow-up observations are often required to categorize and classify these
sources, and may also identify potentially unique or interesting cases. One
such case is IGR J18007-4146, which is likely a CV based on follow-up Chandra
observations and constraints from optical/IR catalogs. Utilizing simultaneous
XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations, as well as the available optical/IR data,
we confirm the nature of IGR J18007-4146 as an intermediate polar type CV.
Timing analysis of the XMM data reveals a periodic signal at 424.4 +/- 0.7 s
that we interpret as the spin period of the white dwarf. Modeling the 0.3-78
keV spectrum, we use a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum but require intrinsic
absorption as well as a soft component and strong Fe lines between 6 and 7 keV.
We model the soft component using a single-temperature blackbody with kT = 73
+8/-6 eV. From the X-ray spectrum, we are able to measure the mass of the white
dwarf to be 1.06 +0.19/-0.10 Msun, which means IGR J18007-4146 is more massive
than the average for magnetic CVs.

Title:Plug Disintegration in GRB Jet Eruption,"
Abstract:  In this work we consider the eruption of a tenuous relativistic hydrodynamic
jet from a dense baryonic envelope. As the jet moves out and away, it carries
along and continues to accelerate a layer of baryonic material which we refer
to as the plug. We solve the relativistic equations of motion for the
trajectory of the plug, and verify it using a relativistic hydrodynamic
simulation. We show that under these conditions, the plug breaks up at a radius
larger by a factor of a few from the radius of the envelope, due to the onset
of the Rayleigh Taylor instability. After breakup the jet continues to
accelerate to higher Lorentz factors while the plug fragments maintain a
moderate Lorentz factor. The presence of slower moving ejecta can explain late
time features of GRBs such as X ray flares without recourse to a long lived
engine.

Title:Incremental Fermi Large Area Telescope Fourth Source Catalog,"
Abstract:  We present an incremental version (4FGL-DR3, for Data Release 3) of the
fourth Fermi-LAT catalog of gamma-ray sources. Based on the first twelve years
of science data in the energy range from 50 MeV to 1 TeV, it contains 6658
sources. The analysis improves on that used for the 4FGL catalog over eight
years of data: more sources are fit with curved spectra, we introduce a more
robust spectral parameterization for pulsars, and we extend the spectral points
to 1 TeV. The spectral parameters, spectral energy distributions, and
associations are updated for all sources. Light curves are rebuilt for all
sources with 1 yr intervals (not 2 month intervals). Among the 5064 original
4FGL sources, 16 were deleted, 112 are formally below the detection threshold
over 12 yr (but are kept in the list), while 74 are newly associated, 10 have
an improved association, and seven associations were withdrawn. Pulsars are
split explicitly between young and millisecond pulsars. Pulsars and binaries
newly detected in LAT sources, as well as more than 100 newly classified
blazars, are reported. We add three extended sources and 1607 new point
sources, mostly just above the detection threshold, among which eight are
considered identified, and 699 have a plausible counterpart at other
wavelengths. We discuss degree-scale residuals to the global sky model and
clusters of soft unassociated point sources close to the Galactic plane, which
are possibly related to limitations of the interstellar emission model and
missing extended sources.

Title:Direct First PSP Observation of the Interaction of Two Successive Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections in November 2020,"
Abstract:  We investigate the effects of the evolutionary processes in the internal
magnetic structure of two interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs)
detected in situ between 2020 November 29 and December 1 by Parker Solar Probe
(PSP). The sources of the ICMEs were observed remotely at the Sun in EUV and
subsequently tracked to their coronal counterparts in white light. This period
is of particular interest to the community since it has been identified as the
first widespread solar energetic particle event of Solar Cycle 25. The
distribution of various solar and heliospheric-dedicated spacecraft throughout
the inner heliosphere during PSP observations of these large-scale magnetic
structures enables a comprehensive analysis of the internal evolution and
topology of such structures. By assembling different models and techniques, we
identify the signatures of interaction between the two consecutive ICMEs and
the implications for their internal structure. We use multispacecraft
observations in combination with a remote-sensing forward modeling technique,
numerical propagation models, and in-situ reconstruction techniques. The
outcome, from the full reconciliations, demonstrates that the two CMEs are
interacting in the vicinity of PSP. Thus, we identify the in-situ observations
based on the physical processes that are associated with the interaction and
collision of both CMEs. We also expand the flux rope modeling and in-situ
reconstruction technique to incorporate the aging and expansion effects in a
distorted internal magnetic structure and explore the implications of both
effects in the magnetic configuration of the ICMEs.

Title:Individual element sensitivity for stellar evolutionary isochrones,"
Abstract:  Stellar evolution calculations with variable abundance ratios were used to
gauge the effects on temperatures, luminosities, and lifetimes in various
phases. Individual elements C, N, O, Mg, Si, and Fe were included. Most of the
effect relevant to integrated light models is contained in the temperature
variable, as opposed to the timescale or luminosity. We derive a recipe for
including abundance-sensitive temperature effects that is applicable to
existing isochrone grids. The resultant enhanced isochrones are incorporated
into composite stellar population models and compared with galaxy data from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A severe oxygen-age degeneracy is apparent, 2 - 3 Gyr
per 0.1 dex in [O/R], where R represents a heavy element such as Fe. Over the
range of early-type galaxy velocity dispersion, the spans of all abundance
ratios are reduced but the age range increases, systematically older. Allowing
Fe-peak elements the freedom to vary accentuates this increase of age span.
Overall, these results sharpen the age-mass correlation known as downsizing but
decrease the steepness of abundance ratio gradients. Both of these
observations, in turn, imply a more robust contribution from gas free mergers
in the histories of typical elliptical galaxies.

near $119.30\,$pc$\,$cm$^{-3}$ and have low mass companion stars
($\sim$$0.01-0.03\,$M$_\odot$), which do not cause strong radio eclipses or
orbital variations. Including these systems, there are now five known black
widow pulsars in M28. The pulsar searches were conducted as a part of an

Survey Project). These faint discoveries demonstrate the advantages of
MeerKAT's survey sensitivity over previous searches and we expect to find
additional pulsars in continued searches of this cluster.

Title:The Environments of CO Cores and Star Formation in the Dwarf Irregular Galaxy WLM,"
Abstract:  The low metallicities of dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrr) greatly influence
the formation and structure of molecular clouds. These clouds, which consist
primarily of H$_2$, are typically traced by CO, but low metallicity galaxies
are found to have little CO despite ongoing star formation. In order to probe
the conditions necessary for CO core formation in dwarf galaxies, we have used
the catalog of Rubio et al. (2022, in preparation) for CO cores in WLM, a Local
Group dwarf with an oxygen abundance that is 13% of solar. Here we aim to
characterize the galactic environments in which these 57 CO cores formed. We
grouped the cores together based on proximity to each other and strong FUV
emission, examining properties of the star forming region enveloping the cores
and the surrounding environment where the cores formed. We find that high HI
surface density does not necessarily correspond to higher total CO mass, but
regions with higher CO mass have higher HI surface densities. We also find the
cores in star forming regions spanning a wide range of ages show no correlation
between age and CO core mass, suggesting that the small size of the cores is
not due to fragmentation of the clouds with age. The presence of CO cores in a
variety of different local environments, along with the similar properties
between star forming regions with and without CO cores, leads us to conclude
that there are no obvious environmental characteristics that drive the
formation of these CO cores.

Title:Gravity or turbulence V: Star forming regions undergoing violent relaxation,"
Abstract:  Using numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of stellar
clusters within molecular clouds, we show that the stars in clusters formed
within collapsing molecular cloud clumps exhibit a constant velocity dispersion
regardless of their mass, as expected in a violent relaxation processes. In
contrast, clusters formed in turbulence-dominated environments exhibit an {\it
inverse} mass segregated velocity dispersion, where massive stars exhibit
larger velocity dispersions than low-mass cores, consistent with massive stars
formed in massive clumps, which in turn, are formed through strong shocks. We
furthermore use Gaia EDR3 to show that the stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster
exhibit a constant velocity dispersion as a function of mass, suggesting that
it has been formed by collapse within one free-fall time of its parental cloud,
rather than in a turbulence-dominated environment during many free-fall times
of a supported cloud. Additionally, we have addressed several of the criticisms
of models of collapsing star forming regions: namely, the age spread of the
ONC, the comparison of the ages of the stars to the free-fall time of the gas
that formed it, the star formation efficiency, and the mass densities of clouds
vs the mass densities of stellar clusters, showing that observational and
numerical data are consistent with clusters forming in clouds undergoing a
process of global, hierarchical and chaotic collapse, rather than been
supported by turbulence.

Title:Rotational modulation of spectroscopic Zeeman signatures in low-mass stars,"
Abstract:  Accurate tracers of the stellar magnetic field and rotation are cornerstones
for the study of M dwarfs and for reliable detection and characterization of
their exoplanetary companions. Such measurements are particularly challenging
for old, slowly rotating, fully convective M dwarfs. To explore the use of new
activity and rotation tracers, we examined multi-year near-infrared
spectroscopic monitoring of two such stars -- GJ 699 (Barnard's Star) and
Teegarden's Star -- carried out with Habitable Zone Planet Finder spectrograph.
We detected periodic variations in absorption line widths across the stellar
spectrum with higher amplitudes towards longer wavelengths. We also detected
similar variations in the strength and width of the 12435.67 Angstrom neutral
potassium (K I) line, a known tracer of the photospheric magnetic field.
Attributing these variations to rotational modulation, we confirm the known
$145\pm15$ d rotation period of GJ 699, and measure the rotation period of
Teegarden's Star to be $99.6\pm1.4$ d. Based on simulations of the K I line and
the wavelength-dependence of the line width signal, we argue that the observed
signals are consistent with varying photospheric magnetic fields and the
associated Zeeman effect. These results highlight the value of detailed line
profile measurements in the near-infrared for diagnosing stellar magnetic field
variability. Such measurements may be pivotal for disentangling activity and
exoplanet-related signals in spectroscopic monitoring of old, low-mass stars.

Title:A partial filament eruption in three steps induced by external magnetic reconnection,"
Abstract:  We present an investigation of partial filament eruption on 2012 June 17 in
the active region NOAA 11504. For the first time, we observed the vertical
splitting process during the partial eruption with high resolution narrow band
images at 10830 . The active filament was rooted in a small sunspot of the
active region. Particularly, it underwent the partial eruption in three steps,
i.e. the precursor, the first eruption, and the second eruption, while the
later two were associated with a C1.0 flare and a C3.9 flare, respectively.
During the precursor, slow magnetic reconnection took place between the
filament and the adjoining loops that also rooted in the sunspot. The
continuous reconnection not only caused the filament to split into three groups
of threads vertically but also formed a new filament, which was growing and
accompanied brightening took place around the site. Subsequently, the growing
filament erupted together with one group splitted threads, resulted in the
first eruption. At the beginning of the first eruption, a subsequent magnetic
reconnection occurred between the erupting splitted threads and another ambient
magnetic loop. After about three minutes, the second eruption occurred as a
result of the eruption of two larger unstable filaments induced by the magnetic
reconnection. The high-resolution observation provides a direct evidence that
magnetic reconnection between filament and its ambient magnetic fields could
induce the vertical splitting of the filament, resulting in partial eruption.

Abstract:  HESS J1804-216 is one of the brightest yet most mysterious TeV gamma-ray
sources discovered to date. Previous arc-minute scale studies of the
interstellar medium (ISM) surrounding this TeV gamma-ray source revealed HESS
J1804-216 is likely powered by a mature supernova remnant (SNR) or pulsar,
hence its origin remains uncertain. In this paper, we focus on the diffusive
escape of cosmic-ray protons from potential SNR accelerators. These cosmic rays
interact with the ISM to produce TeV gamma-rays. We utilise the isotropic
diffusion equation solution for particles escaping from a shell, to model the
energy-dependent escape and propagation of protons into the ISM. This work is
the first attempt at modelling the spatial morphology of gamma-rays towards
HESS J1804-216, using arc-minute ISM observations from both Mopra and the
Southern Galactic Plane Survey. The spectral and spatial distributions of
gamma-rays for the two nearby potential SNR counterparts, SNR G8.7-0.1 and the
progenitor SNR of PSR J1803-2137, are presented here. We vary the diffusion
parameters and particle spectrum and use a grid search approach to find the
best combination of model parameters. We conclude that moderately slow
diffusion is required for both candidates. The most promising candidate to be
powering the TeV gamma-rays from HESS J1804-216 in a hadronic scenario is the
progenitor SNR of PSR J1803-213.

Title:Proper elements for resonant planet-crossing asteroids,"
Abstract:  Proper elements are quasi-integrals of motion, meaning that they can be
considered constant over a certain timespan, and they permit to describe the
long-term evolution with a few parameters. Near-Earth objects (NEOs) generally
have a large eccentricity and therefore they can cross the orbits of the
planets. Moreover, some of them are known to be currently in a mean-motion
resonance with a planet. Thus, the methods previously used for the computation
of main-belt asteroid proper elements are not appropriate for such objects. In
this paper, we introduce a technique for the computation of proper elements of
planet-crossing asteroids that are in a mean-motion resonance with a planet.
First, we numerically average the Hamiltonian over the fast angles while
keeping all the resonant terms, and we describe how to continue a solution
beyond orbit crossing singularities. Proper elements are then extracted from a
frequency analysis of the averaged orbit-crossing solutions. We give proper
elements of some known resonant NEOs, and provide comparisons with non-resonant
models. These examples show that it is necessary to take into account the
effect of the resonance for the computation of accurate proper elements.

Title:Spectral variation across Pulsar Profile due to Coherent Curvature Radiation,"
Abstract:  The pulsar profile is characterised by two distinct emission components, the
core and the cone. The standard model of a pulsar radio emission beam
originating from dipolar magnetic fields, places the core at the centre
surrounded by concentric layers of inner and outer conal components. The core
emission is expected to have steeper spectra compared to the cones. We present
a detailed analysis of the relative differences in spectra between the core and
conal emission from a large sample of 53 pulsars over a wide frequency range
between 100 MHz and 10 GHz. The core was seen to be much steeper than the cones
particularly between 100 MHz and 1 GHz with a relative difference between the
spectral index $\Delta\alpha_{core/cone}\sim$ -1.0. In addition we also found
the spectra of the outer conal components to be steeper than the inner cone
with relative difference in the spectral index $\Delta\alpha_{in/out}\sim$
+0.5. The flattening of the spectra from the magnetic axis towards the edge of
the open field line region with increasing curvature of the field lines is a
natural outcome of the coherent curvature radiation from charged soliton
bunches, and explains the difference in spectra between the core and the cones.
In addition due to the relativistic beaming effect, the radiation is only
visible when it is directed towards the observer over a narrow angle
$\theta\leq 1/\gamma$, where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor of the outflowing
plasma clouds. This restricts the emission particularly from outer cones, that
are associated with field lines with larger curvature thereby making the
spectra steeper than the inner cones.

Title:Photometric signatures of corotating magnetospheres of hot stars governed by higher-order magnetic multipoles,"
Abstract:  The light curves of magnetic, chemically peculiar stars typically show
periodic variability due to surface spots that in most cases can be modeled by
low-order harmonic expansion. However, high-precision satellite photometry
reveals tiny complex features in the light curves of some of these stars that
are difficult to explain as caused by a surface phenomenon under reasonable
assumptions. These features might originate from light extinction in corotating
magnetospheric clouds supported by a complex magnetic field dominated by
higher-order multipoles. We aim to understand the photometric signatures of
corotating magnetospheres that are governed by higher-order multipoles. We
determined the location of magnetospheric clouds from the minima of the
effective potential along the magnetic field lines for different orders of
multipoles and their combination. From the derived magnetospheric density
distribution, we calculated light curves accounting for absorption and
subsequent emission of light. For axisymmetric multipoles, the rigidly rotating
magnetosphere model is able to explain the observed tiny features in the light
curves only when the higher-order multipoles dominate the magnetic field not
only at the stellar surface, but even at the Kepler radius. However, even a
relatively weak nonaxisymmetric component leads to warping of equilibrium
surfaces. This introduces structures that can explain the tiny features
observed in the light curves of chemically peculiar stars. The light emission
contributes to the light variability only if a significant fraction of light is
absorbed in the magnetosphere.

Title:A Decade of Black-Hole X-ray Binary Transients,"
Abstract:  The last decade has seen a significant gain in both space and ground-based
monitoring capabilities, producing vastly better coverage of BH X-ray binaries
during their (rare) transient events. This interval included two of the three
brightest X-ray outbursts ever observed, namely V404 Cyg in 2015, and MAXI
J1820+070 in 2018, as well as the outburst of Swift J1357.2-0933, the first
such system to show variable period optical dipping. There are now superb
multi-wavelength archives of these outbursts, both photometric and
spectroscopic, that show substantial outflows in the form of jets and disc
winds, and X-ray spectroscopy/timing that reveals how the inner accretion disc
evolves. The ground-based AAVSO optical monitoring of the MAXI J1820+070 event
was the most extensive ever obtained, revealing periodic variations that
evolved as it approached its state transition. These modulations were of an
amplitude never seen before, and suggested the development of an
irradiation-driven disc warp that persisted through the transition. All these
results have demonstrated the power of extensive multi-wavelength photometric
and spectroscopic monitoring on all time-scales.

Title:Alleviating the Transit Timing Variations bias in transit surveys. II. RIVERS: Twin resonant Earth-sized planets around Kepler-1972 recovered from Kepler's false positive,"
Abstract:  Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) can provide useful information for systems
observed by transit, by putting constraints on the masses and eccentricities of
the observed planets, or even constrain the existence of non-transiting
companions. However, TTVs can also prevent the detection of small planets in
transit surveys, or bias the recovered planetary and transit parameters. Here
we show that Kepler-1972 c, initially the ""not transit-like"" false positive
KOI-3184.02, is an Earth-sized planet whose orbit is perturbed by Kepler-1972 b
(initially KOI-3184.01). The pair is locked in a 3:2 Mean-motion resonance,
each planet displaying TTVs of more than 6h hours of amplitude over the
duration of the Kepler mission. The two planets have similar masses $m_b/m_c
=0.956_{-0.051}^{+0.056}$ and radii $R_b=0.802_{-0.041}^{+0.042}R_{Earth}$,
$R_c=0.868_{-0.050}^{+0.051}R_{Earth}$, and the whole system, including the
inner candidate KOI-3184.03, appear to be coplanar. Despite the faintness of
the signals (SNR of 1.35 for each transit of Kepler-1972 b and 1.10 for
Kepler-1972 c), we recovered the transits of the planets using the RIVERS
method, based on the recognition of the tracks of planets in river diagrams
using machine learning, and a photo-dynamic fit of the lightcurve. Recovering
the correct ephemerides of the planets is essential to have a complete picture
of the observed planetary systems. In particular, we show that in Kepler-1972,
not taking into account planet-planet interactions yields an error of $\sim
30\%$ on the radii of planets b and c, in addition to generating in-transit
scatter, which leads to mistake KOI3184.02 for a false positive. Alleviating
this bias is essential for an unbiased view of Kepler systems, some of the TESS
stars, and the upcoming PLATO mission.

Title:Simulation of a Xe-based X-ray Polarimeter at 10-30 keV,"
Abstract:  Polarization detection of X-rays is a non-negligible topic to astrophysical
observation. Many polarization detection methods have been well developed for
X-rays in the energy range below 10~keV, while the detection at 10-30~keV is
rarely discussed. This paper presents a simulation study of a Xe-based gas
pixel detector, which can achieve the polarization detection of X-rays at
10-30~keV. To verify the emission angle distribution of photoelectrons,
different electromagnetic models in Geant4 were investigated. After a necessary
modification by considering the missing factor when sampling the emission
angle, a good agreement can be achieved. Moreover, the detection capability of
20~keV polarized photons was discussed and the modulation factor could be 43\%.

Title:Statistical properties of the nebular spectra of 103 stripped envelope core collapse supernovae,"
Abstract:  We present an analysis of the nebular spectra of 103 stripped envelope (SE)
supernovae (SNe) collected from the literature and observed with the Subaru
Telescope from 2002 to 2012, focusing on [O I] 6300, 6363. The line profile and
width of [O I] are employed to infer the ejecta geometry and the expansion
velocity of the inner core. These two measurements are then compared with the
SN sub types, and further with the [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, which is used as an
indicator of the progenitor CO core mass. Based on the best fit results of the
[O I] profile, the objects are classified into different morphological groups,
and we conclude that the deviation from spherical symmetry is a common feature
for all types of SESNe. There is a hint (at about 1 sigma level) that the
distributions of the line profile fractions are different between canonical
SESNe and broad-line SNe Ic. A correlation between [O I] width and [O I]/[Ca
II] ratio is discerned, indicating that the oxygen-rich material tends to
expand faster for objects with a more massive CO core. Such a correlation can
be utilized to constrain the relation between the progenitor mass and the
kinetic energy of the explosion. Further, when [O I]/[Ca II] ratio increases,
the fraction of objects with Gaussian [O I] profile increases, while those with
double-peaked profile decreases. This phenomenon connects ejecta geometry and
the progenitor CO core mass.

Title:Correlated orientations of the axes of large quasar groups on Gpc scales,"
Abstract:  Correlated orientations of quasar optical and radio polarisation, and of
radio jets, have been reported on Gpc scales, possibly arising from intrinsic
alignment of spin axes. Optical quasar polarisation appears to be
preferentially either aligned or orthogonal to the host large-scale structure,
specifically large quasar groups (LQGs). Using a sample of 71 LQGs at redshifts
$1.0 \leq z \leq 1.8$, we investigate whether LQGs themselves exhibit
correlated orientation. We find that LQG position angles (PAs) are unlikely to
be drawn from a uniform distribution ($p$-values $0.008 \lesssim p \lesssim
0.07$). The LQG PA distribution is bimodal, with median modes at
$\bar{\theta}\sim45\pm2^{\circ}, 136\pm2^{\circ}$, remarkably close to the mean
angles of quasar radio polarisation reported in two regions coincident with our
LQG sample. We quantify the degree of alignment in the PA data, and find that
LQGs are aligned and orthogonal across very large scales. The maximum
significance is $\simeq 0.8\%$ ($2.4\sigma$) at typical angular (proper)
separations of $\sim 30^{\circ}$ (1.6 Gpc). If the LQG orientation correlation
is real, it represents large-scale structure alignment over scales larger than
those predicted by cosmological simulations and at least an order of magnitude
larger than any so far observed, with the exception of quasar-polarisation /
radio-jet alignment. We conclude that LQG alignment helps explain
quasar-polarisation / radio-jet alignment, but raises challenging questions
about the origin of the LQG correlation and the assumptions of the concordance
cosmological model.

Title:Thermal structure and aerosols in Mars' atmosphere from TIRVIM/ACS onboard the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter : validation of the retrieval algorithm,"
Abstract:  The Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS) onboard the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter
(TGO) monitors the Martian atmosphere through different spectral intervals in
the infrared light. We present a retrieval algorithm tailored to the analysis
of spectra acquired in nadir geometry by TIRVIM, the thermal infrared channel
of ACS. Our algorithm simultaneously retrieves vertical profile of atmospheric
temperature up to 50 km, surface temperature, and integrated optical depth of
dust and water ice clouds. The specificity of the TIRVIM dataset lies in its
capacity to resolve the diurnal cycle over a 54 sol period. However, it is
uncertain to what extent can the desired atmospheric quantities be accurately
estimated at different times of day. Here we first present an Observing System
Simulation Experiment (OSSE). We produce synthetic observations at various
latitudes, seasons and local times and run our retrieval algorithm on these
synthetic data, to evaluate its robustness. Different sources of biases are
documented, in particular regarding aerosol retrievals. Atmospheric temperature
retrievals are found robust even when dust and/or water ice cloud opacities are
not well estimated in our OSSE. We then apply our algorithm to TIRVIM
observations in April-May, 2018 and perform a cross-validation of retrieved
atmospheric temperature and dust integrated opacity by comparisons with
thousands of co-located Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) retrievals. Most differences
between TIRVIM and MCS atmospheric temperatures can be attributed to
differences in vertical sensitivity. Daytime dust opacities agree well with
each other, while biases are found in nighttime dust opacity retrieved from
TIRVIM at this season.

Abstract:  The LOw-Frequency ARray is a low-frequency radio interferometer composed by
observational stations spread across Europe and it is the largest precursor of
SKA in terms of effective area and generated data rates. In 2018, the Italian
community officially joined LOFAR project, and it deployed a distributed

infrastructure is based on 4 nodes distributed in different Italian locations

computational resources. In this paper, we describe the architecture and main

Title:Exploring the Connection between UV/Optical Variations and Radio Emission in Radio-Quiet Quasars: Clues on Radio Emission Origin,"
Abstract:  The radio emission in radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) has been a long mystery and
its physical origin remains unclear. In a previous work we find UV/optical more
variable quasars have stronger X-ray emission, indicating a link between disc
turbulence and X-ray corona heating. In this work, for the first time, we
investigate the relation between UV/optical variability and the radio emission
in RQQs selected from SDSS stripe 82 and FIRST radio survey. We median stack
the FIRST images and detect clear signals from RQQs in the co-added images of
individually radio non-detected sources. Controlling the effects of other
parameters, including redshift, black hole mass, bolometric luminosity and
Eddington ratio, we find more variable RQQs, which are known to be X-ray
relatively brighter, show tentatively weaker radio emission, contrary to the
linear X-ray/radio correlation if the radio emission is from or driven by the
corona. The discovery also suggests that if the radio emission in RQQs is
driven by AGN activity (such as weak jet), the underlying driving process is
independent to the disc turbulence which drives UV/optical variability and
probably also corona heating. Alternatively, the radio emission could be due to
star formation in the host galaxies.

Title:A Comprehensive Bayesian re-analysis of the SARAS2 data from the Epoch of Reionization,"
Abstract:  We present a Bayesian re-analysis of the sky-averaged 21-cm experimental data
from SARAS2 using nested sampling implemented with polychord, spectrally smooth
foreground modelling implemented with maxsmooth, detailed systematic modelling
and rapid signal emulation with globalemu. Our analysis differs from previous
analysis of the SARAS2 data through the use of a full Bayesian framework and
separate modelling of the foreground and non-smooth systematics. We use the
most up-to-date signal models including Lyman-$\alpha$ and CMB heating
parameterised by astrophysical parameters such as star formation efficiency,
X-ray heating efficiency, minimal virial circular velocity of star forming
galaxies, CMB optical depth and the low energy cutoff of the X-ray spectral
energy distribution. We consider models with an excess radio background above
the CMB produced via radio emission from early galaxies and parameterised by a
radio production efficiency. A non-smooth systematic is identified and modelled
as both a frequency damped sinusoid introduced by the electronics and
separately from the sky. The latter is modulated by the total efficiency of the
antenna and marginally favoured by the data. We consider three different models
for the noise in the data. The SARAS2 constraints on individual astrophysical
parameters are extremely weak however we identify classes of disfavoured
signals. We weakly disfavour standard astrophysical models with high
Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes and weak heating and more confidently disfavour exotic
models with high Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes, low X-ray efficiencies and high radio
production efficiencies in early galaxies.

Title:Water content trends in K2-138 and other low-mass multiplanetary systems,"
Abstract:  Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes have been found simultaneously in
multiplanetary systems, suggesting that they are appropriate to study
composition and formation within the same environment. We perform a homogeneous
interior structure analysis of five multiplanetary systems to explore the
compositional trends and its relation with planet formation. For K2-138, we
present revised masses and stellar host chemical abundances to improve the
constraints on the planetary interior. We conduct a line-by-line differential
spectroscopic analysis on the stellar spectra to obtain its chemical abundances
and the planetary parameters. We select multiplanetary systems with five or
more low-mass planets that have both mass and radius data available. We carry
out a homogeneous interior structure analysis on the systems K2-138, TOI-178,
Kepler-11, Kepler-102 and Kepler-80 and estimate the volatile mass fraction of
their planets assuming a volatile layer constituted of water in steam and
supercritical phases. Our interior-atmosphere model takes into account the
effects of irradiation on the surface conditions. K2-138 inner planets present
an increasing volatile mass fraction with distance from its host star, while
the outer planets present an approximately constant water content. This is
similar to the trend observed in TRAPPIST-1 in a previous analysis with the
same interior-atmosphere model. The Kepler-102 system could potentially present
this trend. In all multiplanetary systems, the low volatile mass fraction of
the inner planets could be due to atmospheric escape while the higher volatile
mass fraction of the outer planets can be the result of accretion of ice-rich
material in the vicinity of the ice line with later inward migration.
Kepler-102 and Kepler-80 present inner planets with high core mass fractions
which could be due to mantle evaporation, impacts or formation in the vicinity
of rocklines.

Title:Solar jets: SDO and IRIS observations in the perspective of new MHD simulations,"
Abstract:  Solar jets are observed as collimated plasma beams over a large range of
temperatures and wavelengths. They have been observed in Halpha and optical
lines for more than 50 years and called surges. The term ""jet"" comes from X-ray
observations after the launch of the Yohkoh satellite in 1991. They are the
means of transporting energy through the heliosphere and participate to the
corona heating and the acceleration of solar wind. Several characteristics have
been derived about their velocities, their rates of occurrence, and their
relationship with CMEs. However, the initiation mechanism of jets, e.g.
emerging flux, flux cancellation, or twist, is still debated. In the last
decade coordinated observations of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS) with the instruments on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) allow
to make a step forward for understanding the trigger of jets and the
relationship between hot jets and cool surges. We observe at the same time the
development of 2D and 3D MHD numerical simulations to interpret the results.
This paper summarizes recent studies of jets showing the loci of magnetic
reconnection in null points or in bald patch regions forming a current sheet.
In the pre-jet phase a twist is frequently detected by the existence of a mini
filament close to the dome of emerging flux. The twist can also be transferred
to the jet from a flux rope in the vicinity of the reconnection by slippage of
the polarities. Bidirectional flows are detected at the reconnection sites. We
show the role of magnetic currents detected in the footprints of flux rope and
quasi-separatrix layers for initiating the jets.
We select a few studies and show that with the same observations, different
interpretations are possible based on different approaches e.g. non linear
force free field extrapolation or 3D MHD simulation.

Abstract:  We compute the weak lensing Jacobi map at first order in perturbation theory

therefore do not induce any rotation. However, vector and tensor perturbations
do induce $B$-modes in the shear. We show that contrary to what is often
claimed in the literature, the shear $B$-mode power spectrum is not fully
determined by the rotation power spectrum. Also the $E$-mode shear power
spectrum is not determined by the convergence power spectrum. While this
difference is small for scalar perturbations, it becomes very relevant for
tensor perturbations, i.e. gravitational waves.

weeks to years, and by large scale ground-based surveys spanning years designed
to detect all time-variable phenomena. The new high precision data are full of

decade primarily as a result of light curves from the Kepler and TESS space
missions for: massive upper main-sequence OBAF stars, pre-main-sequence stars,
peculiar stars, classical pulsators, white dwarfs and subdwarfs, and tidally
interacting close binaries.

convective overshoot, core burning stage - supporting disparate fields such as
galactic archeology, exoplanet host stars, supernovae progenitors, gamma ray
and gravitational wave precursors, close binary star origins and evolution, and
standard candles.

Title:Tick-Tock: The Imminent Merger of a Supermassive Black Hole Binary,"
Abstract:  Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHs) are a fascinating byproduct of
galaxy mergers in the hierarchical universe. In the last stage of their orbital
evolution, gravitational wave radiation drives the binary inspiral and produces
the loudest siren awaiting to be detected by gravitational wave observatories.
Periodically varying emission from active galactic nuclei has been proposed as
a powerful approach to probe such systems, although none of the identified
candidates are close to their final coalescence such that the observed periods
stay constant in time. In this work, we report on the first system with rapid
decaying periods revealed by its optical and X-ray light curves, which has
decreased from about one year to one month in three years. Together with its
optical hydrogen line spectroscopy, we propose that the system is an uneven
mass-ratio, highly eccentric SMBH binary which will merge within three years,
as predicted by the trajectory evolution model. If the interpretation is true,
coordinated, multi-band electromagnetic campaign should be planned for this
first binary SMBH merger event observed in human history, together with
possible neutrino measurements. Gravitational wave memory from this event may
also be detectable by Pulsar Timing Array with additional five-to-ten year
observation.

Abstract:  Solar Atmospheric Neutrinos (SA$\nu$s) are produced by the interaction of

Title:Cascade adaptive optics: contrast performance analysis of a two-stage controller by numerical simulations,"
Abstract:  The contrast performance of current eXtreme Adaptive Optics (XAO) systems can
be improved by adding a second AO correction stage featuring its own wavefront
sensor, deformable mirror, and real-time controller. We develop a dynamical
model for such a cascade AO (CAO) system with two stages each controlled by a
standard integrator, and study its control properties. We study how such a
configuration can improve an existing system without modifying the first stage.
We analyze the CAO architecture in general and show how part of the disturbance
is transferred from low to high temporal frequencies with a nefarious effect of
the second stage integrator overshoot, and suggest possible ways to mitigate
this. We also carry out numerical simulations of the particular case of a first
stage AO using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor and a second stage AO with a
smaller deformable mirror running at a higher framerate to reduce temporal
error. In this case, we demonstrate that the second stage improves imaging
contrast by one order of magnitude and shortens the decorrelation time of
atmospheric turbulence speckles by even a greater factor. The results show that
CAO presents a promising and relatively simple way to upgrade some existing XAO
systems and achieve improved imaging contrasts fostering a large number of
science cases including the direct imaging of Exoplanets.

"Title:DI Herculis Revisited: Starspots, Gravity Darkening, and 3-D Obliquities","
Abstract:  DI Herculis is an eclipsing binary famous for a longstanding disagreement
between theory and observation of the apsidal precession rate, which was
resolved when both stars were found to be severely misaligned with the orbit.
We used data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to refine
our knowledge of the stellar obliquities and sharpen the comparison between the
observed and theoretical precession rates. The TESS data show variations with a
1.07-day period, which we interpret as rotational modulation from starspots on
the primary star. This interpretation is supported by the detection of
photometric anomalies during primary eclipses consistent with starspot
crossings. The secondary eclipse light curve shows a repeatable asymmetry which
we interpret as an effect of gravity darkening. By combining the TESS data with
previously obtained data, we determined the three-dimensional spin directions
of both stars. Using this information, the updated value of the theoretical
apsidal precession rate (including the effects of tides, rotation, and general
relativity) is $1.35^{+0.58}_{-0.50}$ arcsec/cycle. The updated value of the
observed rate (after including new TESS eclipse times) is
$1.41^{+0.39}_{-0.28}$ arcsec/cycle. Given the agreement between the observed
and theoretical values, we fitted all the relevant data simultaneously assuming
the theory is correct. This allowed us to place tighter constraints on the
stellar obliquities, which are $75^{+3}_{-3}$ and $80^{+3}_{-3}$ degrees for
the primary and secondary stars, respectively.

Title:Long-period Pulsars as Possible Outcomes of Supernova Fallback Accretion,"
Abstract:  For about half a century the radio pulsar population was observed to spin in
the ~0.002-12s range, with different pulsar classes having a spin-period
evolution that differs substantially depending on their magnetic fields or past
accretion history. The recent detection of several slowly rotating pulsars has
re-opened the long-standing question of the exact physics, and observational
biases, driving the upper bound of the period range of the pulsar population.
In this work, we perform a parameter study of the spin-period evolution of
pulsars interacting with supernova fallback matter and specifically look at the
fallback accretion disk scenario. Depending on the initial conditions at
formation, this evolution can differ substantially from the typical dipolar
spin-down, resulting in pulsars that show spin periods longer than their coeval
peers. By using general assumptions for the pulsar spin period and magnetic
field at birth, initial fallback accretion rates and including magnetic field
decay, we find that very long spin periods (>100s) can be reached in the
presence of strong, magnetar-like magnetic fields (>10^{14}G) and moderate
initial fallback accretion rates (~10^{22-27} g s^{-1}). In addition, we study
the cases of two recently discovered periodic radio sources, the pulsar PSR
J0901-4046 (P = 75.9 s) and the radio transient GLEAM-X\,J162759.5-523504.3 (P
= 1091 s), in light of our model. We conclude that the supernova fallback
scenario could represent a viable channel to produce a population of
long-period isolated pulsars that only recent observation campaigns are
starting to unveil.

Title:The spatially resolved PAH characteristics in the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51a),"
Abstract:  We present a detailed study on the spatially resolved polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) emission properties in the (circum)nuclear region (NR) and
extranuclear regions (ENRs) of M51a using Spitzer-IRS observations.
Correlations among PAH intensity ratios are examined with respect to each
other, local physical parameters, galactocentric distance ($R_{g}$), and very
small grain (VSG) emission. Additional comparison is performed with the
mid-infrared emission features in the H$_{\mathrm{II}}$ regions of M33 and M83.
The NR exhibits the strongest correlation among the PAH intensity ratios,
whereas ENRs are showing increased scatter attributed to ISM emission. Overall,
the radiation field hardness has a higher impact on PAH emission than
metallicity, with the latter regulating PAH variance as a function of $R_{g}$.
Specifically, the variance of PAH emission with respect to the different
physical parameters suggests a higher rate of small/medium PAH processing
compared to large PAHs and a higher ratio of small-to-large PAHs formed with
increasing galactocentric distance. We find similarities between the 7.7 $\mu$m
carriers in M51a's NR and M83's H$_{\mathrm{II}}$ regions, the 8.6 $\mu$m
carriers in M51a's NR and M33 H$_{\mathrm{II}}$ regions, and both types of
carriers between M51a's ENRs, M33's, and M83's H$_{\mathrm{II}}$ regions. We
have identified a positive correlation between PAH/VSG and the PAH intensity
ratios. We conclude that the relative abundance of PAHs and VSG is not solely

"Title:The Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum Survey I: New, Diverse Local Lyman-Continuum Emitters","
Abstract:  The origins of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons responsible for the reionization
of the universe are as of yet unknown and highly contested. Detecting LyC
photons from the epoch of reionization is not possible due to absorption by the
intergalactic medium, which has prompted the development of several indirect
diagnostics to infer the rate at which galaxies contribute LyC photons to
reionize the universe by studying lower-redshift analogs. We present the
Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS) comprising measurements made with
HST/COS for a z=0.2-0.4 sample of 66 galaxies. After careful processing of the
FUV spectra, we obtain a total of 35 Lyman continuum emitters (LCEs) detected
with 97.725% confidence, nearly tripling the number of known local LCEs. We
estimate escape fractions from the detected LyC flux and upper limits on the
undetected LyC flux, finding a range of LyC escape fractions up to 50%. Of the
35 LzLCS LCEs, 12 have LyC escape fractions greater than 5%, more than doubling
the number of known local LCEs with cosmologically relevant LyC escape.

Title:Revealing new high redshift quasar populations through Gaussian mixture model selection,"
Abstract:  We present a novel method to identify candidate high redshift quasars (HzQs;
($z\gtrsim5.5$), which are unique probes of supermassive black hole growth in
the early Universe, from large area optical/infrared photometric surveys. Using
Gaussian Mixture Models to construct likelihoods and incorporate informed
priors based on population statistics, our method uses a Bayesian framework to
assign posterior probabilities that differentiate between HzQs and
contaminating sources. We additionally include deep radio data to obtain
informed priors. Using existing HzQ data in the literature, we set a posterior
threshold that accepts ${\sim}90\%$ of known HzQs while rejecting $>99\%$ of
contaminants such as dwarf stars or lower redshift galaxies. Running the
probability selection on test samples of simulated HzQs and contaminants, we
find that the efficacy of the probability method is higher than traditional
colour cuts, decreasing the fraction of accepted contaminants by 86% while
retaining a similar fraction of HzQs. As a test, we apply our method to the
Pan-STARRS Data Release 1 (PS1) source catalogue within the HETDEX Spring field
area on the sky, covering 400 sq. deg. and coinciding with deep radio data from
the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 1 (LoTSS DR1). From an initial
sample of ${\sim}5\times10^5$ sources in PS1, our selection shortlists 251
candidate HzQs, which are further reduced to 63 after visual inspection.
Shallow spectroscopic follow-up of 13 high probability HzQs resulted in the
confirmation of a previously undiscovered quasar at $z=5.66$ with photometric
colours $i-z = 1.4$, lying outside the typically probed regions when selecting
HzQs based on colours. This discovery demonstrates the efficacy of our
probabilistic HzQ selection method in selecting more complete HzQ samples,
which holds promise when employed on large existing and upcoming photometric
data sets.

Title:Milky Way Satellite Census. IV. Constraints on Decaying Dark Matter from Observations of Milky Way Satellite Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We use a recent census of the Milky Way (MW) satellite galaxy population to
constrain the lifetime of particle dark matter (DM). We consider two-body
decaying dark matter (DDM) in which a heavy DM particle decays with lifetime
$\tau$ comparable to the age of the Universe to a lighter DM particle (with
mass splitting $\epsilon$) and to a dark radiation species. These decays impart
a characteristic ""kick velocity,"" $V_{\mathrm{kick}}=\epsilon c$, on the DM
daughter particles, significantly depleting the DM content of low-mass subhalos
and making them more susceptible to tidal disruption. We fit the suppression of
the present-day DDM subhalo mass function (SHMF) as a function of $\tau$ and
$V_{\mathrm{kick}}$ using a suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of
MW-mass halos, and we validate this model on new DDM simulations of systems
specifically chosen to resemble the MW. We implement our DDM SHMF predictions
in a forward model that incorporates inhomogeneities in the spatial
distribution and detectability of MW satellites and uncertainties in the
mapping between galaxies and DM halos, the properties of the MW system, and the
disruption of subhalos by the MW disk using an empirical model for the
galaxy--halo connection. By comparing to the observed MW satellite population,
we conservatively exclude DDM models with $\tau < 18\ \mathrm{Gyr}$ ($29\
\mathrm{Gyr}$) for $V_{\mathrm{kick}}=20\ \mathrm{km}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ($40\
\mathrm{km}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$) at $95\%$ confidence. These constraints are
among the most stringent and robust small-scale structure limits on the DM
particle lifetime and strongly disfavor DDM models that have been proposed to
alleviate the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions.

Title:Implications for Galaxy Formation Models from Observations of Globular Clusters around Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We present an analysis of Hubble Space Telescope observations of globular
clusters (GCs) in six ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Coma cluster, a
sample that represents UDGs with large effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$), and use
the results to evaluate competing formation models. We eliminate two
significant sources of systematic uncertainty in the determination of the
number of GCs, $N_{\rm GC}$ by using sufficiently deep observations that (i)
reach the turnover of the GC luminosity function and (ii) provide a sufficient
number of GCs with which to measure the GC number radial distribution. We find
that $N_{\rm GC}$ for these galaxies is on average $\sim$20, which implies an
average total mass, $M_{\rm total}$, $\sim$ $10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$ when applying
the relation between $N_{\rm GC}$ and $M_{\rm total}$. This value of $N_{\rm
GC}$ lies at the upper end of the range observed for dwarf galaxies of the same
stellar mass and is roughly a factor of two larger than the mean. The GC
luminosity function, radial profile and average colour are more consistent with
those observed for dwarf galaxies than with those observed for the more massive
($L^*$) galaxies, while both the radial and azimuthal GC distributions closely
follow those of the stars in the host galaxy. Finally, we discuss why our
observations, specifically the GC number and GC distribution around these six
UDGs, pose challenges for several of the currently favoured UDG formation
models.

Title:Host galaxy properties of quasi-periodically erupting X-ray sources,"
Abstract:  Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions (QPEs) are a recently discovered phenomenon,
the nature of which remains unclear. Based on their discovery in active
galactic nuclei (AGN), explanations related to an AGN accretion disk, or
potentially stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), were put forward. Following
the report of QPEs in apparently passive galaxies, alternatives including
highly unequal mass compact object binaries have been proposed to explain their
properties. We perform a systematic study of the five known QPE host galaxies
with the aim of providing new insights into their nature. We analyse new and
archival medium resolution optical spectroscopy of the QPE hosts. We measure
emission (and absorption) line fluxes, their ratios and equivalent widths
(EWs), to locate the QPE hosts on diagnostic diagrams. We also measure the
velocity dispersion of the stellar absorption lines to estimate their black
hole masses. All QPE host galaxies show emission lines in their optical
spectra. Based on their ratios and EWs, we find evidence for the presence of an
active galactic nucleus in all sources, including those previously reported as
passive. We measure velocity dispersions between 36 and 90 km/s, implying the
presence of low mass (10^5-6.7 solar masses) black holes, consistent with
literature findings. Finally, we find a significant over-representation (2/5
sources, or a factor of 13 +13 -10.5) of quiescent, Balmer strong (post
starburst) galaxies among QPE hosts. The presence of a narrow line region
consistent with an AGN in all QPE host galaxies implies that a pre-existing
accretion flow likely plays an integral part to the QPE phenomenon. The strong
over-representation of quiescent Balmer strong galaxies among QPE hosts can be
naturally explained in both the TDE and interacting extreme mass ratio inspiral
hypotheses.

Title:Gas dynamics in dwarf galaxies as testbeds for dark matter and galaxy evolution,"
Abstract:  Dwarf galaxies are ideal laboratories to test dark matter models and
alternative theories because their dynamical mass (from observed kinematics)
largely outweighs their baryonic mass (from gas and stars). In most
star-forming dwarfs, cold atomic gas forms regularly rotating disks extending
beyond the stellar component, thus probing the gravitational potential out to
the outermost regions. Here I review several aspects of gas dynamics in dwarf
galaxies, such as rotation curves, mass models, and noncircular motions.
Star-forming dwarfs extend the dynamical laws of spiral galaxies to lower
masses, surface densities, and accelerations. The three main dynamical laws of
rotation-supported galaxies point to three distinct acceleration scales, which
play different physical roles but display the same value, within uncertainties.
The small scatter around these dynamical laws implies a tight coupling between
baryons and dark matter in galaxies, which will be better understood with
next-generation surveys that will enlarge current sample sizes by orders of
magnitude.

Title:Jet Formation in 3D GRMHD Simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton Accretion,"
Abstract:  A black hole (BH) travelling through a uniform, gaseous medium is described
by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. If the medium is magnetized, then the
black hole can produce relativistic outflows. We performed the first 3D,
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of BHL accretion onto
rapidly rotating black holes using the code H-AMR, where we mainly varied the
strength of a background magnetic field that threads the medium. We found that
the ensuing accretion continuously drags to the BH the magnetic flux, which
accumulates near the event horizon until it becomes dynamically important.
Depending on the strength of the background magnetic field, the BHs can
sometimes launch relativistic jets with high enough power to drill out of the
inner accretion flow, become bent by the headwind, and escape to large
distances. While for stronger background magnetic fields the jets are
continuously powered, at weaker field strengths they are intermittent, turning
on and off depending on the fluctuating gas and magnetic flux distributions
near the event horizon. We find that our jets reach extremely high efficiencies
of $\sim100-300\%$, even in the absence of an accretion disk. We also
calculated the drag forces exerted by the gas onto to the BH, finding that the
presence of magnetic fields causes drag forces to be much less efficient than
in unmagnetized BHL accretion, and sometimes become negative, accelerating the
BH rather than slowing it down. Our results extend classical BHL accretion to
rotating BHs moving through magnetized media and demonstrate that accretion and
drag are significantly altered in this environment.

Title:AGN accretion and black hole growth across compact and extended galaxy evolution phases,"
Abstract:  The extent of black hole growth during different galaxy evolution phases and
the connection between galaxy compactness and AGN activity remain poorly
understood. We use Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the CANDELS fields to
identify star-forming and quiescent galaxies at z=0.5-3 in both compact and
extended phases and use Chandra X-ray imaging to measure the distribution of
AGN accretion rates and track black hole growth within these galaxies.
Accounting for the impact of AGN light changes ~20% of the X-ray sources from
compact to extended galaxy classifications. We find that ~10-25% of compact
star-forming galaxies host an AGN, a mild enhancement (by a factor ~2) compared
to extended star-forming galaxies or compact quiescent galaxies of equivalent
stellar mass and redshift. However, AGN are not ubiquitous in compact
star-forming galaxies and this is not the evolutionary phase, given its
relatively short timescale, where the bulk of black hole mass growth takes
place. Conversely, we measure the highest AGN fractions (~10-30%) within the
relatively rare population of extended quiescent galaxies. For massive galaxies
that quench at early cosmic epochs, substantial black hole growth in this
extended phase is crucial to produce the elevated black hole mass-to-galaxy
stellar mass scaling relation observed for quiescent galaxies at z~0. We also
show that AGN fraction increases with compactness in star-forming galaxies and
decreases in quiescent galaxies within both the compact and extended
sub-populations, demonstrating that AGN activity depends closely on the
structural properties of galaxies.

Title:A Simple Condition for Sustained Super-Eddington Black Hole Growth,"
Abstract:  One of the most pressing questions in cosmology is how the black holes (BHs)
powering quasars at high redshift grow to supermassive scales within a billion
years of the Big Bang. Here we show that sustained super-Eddington accretion
can be achieved for BHs with Eddington fractions $f_{\rm Edd}$ > 2/$\epsilon$,
where $\epsilon$ is the efficiency with which radiation is generated in the
accretion process. In this regime, the radiation carries too little momentum to
halt the accretion flow and the infalling gas traps the radiation. The BH
growth then proceeds unimpeded until the gas supply is exhausted, in contrast
to accretion at lower rates which is limited by the radiation generated in the
accretion process. The large gas supply available in massive high-redshift
quasar host galaxies may be readily accreted onto seed BHs via this
supply-limited mode of accretion, providing an explanation for how such
supermassive BHs are assembled in the early universe. This sustained
super-Eddington growth may also explain the short lifetimes inferred for the H
II regions surrounding high-redshift quasars, if the bulk of the BH growth
occurs without the associated radiation escaping to ionize the intergalactic
medium. It furthermore implies that a population of obscured rapidly growing
BHs may be difficult to detect, perhaps explaining why so few quasars with
Eddington fractions higher than a few have been observed. Finally, this simple
condition for sustained super-Eddington growth can easily be implemented in
cosmological simulations which can be used to assess in which environments it
occurs.

Title:Radius Constraints from Reflection Modeling of Cygnus X-2 with NuSTAR and NICER,"
Abstract:  We present a spectral analysis of NuSTAR and NICER observations of the
luminous, persistently accreting neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary Cygnus
X-2. The data were divided into different branches that the source traces out
on the Z-track of the X-ray color-color diagram; namely the horizontal branch,
normal branch, and the vertex between the two. The X-ray continuum spectrum was
modeled in two different ways that produced a comparable quality fit. The
spectra showed clear evidence of a reflection component in the form of a
broadened Fe K line, as well as a lower energy emission feature near 1 keV
likely due to an ionized plasma located far from the innermost accretion disk.
We account for the reflection spectrum with two independent models (relxillns
and rdblur*rfxconv). The inferred inclination is in agreement with earlier
estimates from optical observations of ellipsoidal light curve modeling
(relxillns: $i=67^{\circ}\pm4^{\circ}$, rdblur*rfxconv:
$i=60^{\circ}\pm10^{\circ}$). The inner disk radius remains close to the NS
($R_{\rm in}\leq1.15\ R_{\mathrm{ISCO}}$) regardless of the source position
along the Z-track or how the 1 keV feature is modeled. Given the optically
determined NS mass of $1.71\pm0.21\ M_{\odot}$, this corresponds to a
conservative upper limit of $R_{\rm in}\leq19.5$ km for $M=1.92\ M_{\odot}$ or
$R_{\rm in}\leq15.3$ km for $M=1.5\ M_{\odot}$. We compare these radius
constraints to those obtained from NS gravitational wave merger events and
recent NICER pulsar light curve modeling measurements.

Title:Origins of Hot Jupiters from the Stellar Obliquity Distribution,"
Abstract:  The obliquity of a star, or the angle between its spin axis and the average
orbit normal of its companion planets, provides a unique constraint on that
system's evolutionary history. Unlike the Solar System, where the Sun's equator
is nearly aligned with its companion planets, many hot Jupiter systems have
been discovered with large spin-orbit misalignments, hosting planets on polar
or retrograde orbits. We demonstrate that, in contrast to stars harboring hot
Jupiters on circular orbits, those with eccentric companions follow no
population-wide obliquity trend with stellar temperature. This finding can be
naturally explained through a combination of high-eccentricity migration and
tidal damping. Furthermore, we show that the joint obliquity and eccentricity
distributions observed today are consistent with the outcomes of
high-eccentricity migration, with no strict requirement to invoke the other hot
Jupiter formation mechanisms of disk migration or in-situ formation. At a
population-wide level, high-eccentricity migration can consistently shape the
dynamical evolution of hot Jupiter systems.

Abstract:  We present Keck/NIRC2 $K_{\rm p}L_{\rm p}$ high-contrast imaging observations

cavity, which is the second report among protoplanetary disks in the Perseus
star forming region after the LkH$\alpha$~330 system. Our data and forward
modeling using RADMC-3D suggests $\sim80$~au for the cavity radius. There is
discrepancy between J0337's SED and the modeled SED at $\sim10\micron$ and this
suggests an unseen inner disk. We also searched for companions around J0337 but
did not detect any companion candidates at separations between $0\farcs1$ and
$2\farcs5$. The $L_{\rm p}$-band detection limit corresponds to $\sim20 M_{\rm
Jup}$ at 60~au, $\sim9-10 M_{\rm Jup}$ at 90~au, and $\sim3 M_{\rm Jup}$ at
$>120$~au. Compared with other young systems with large cavities such as PDS~70
and RX~J1604, multiple Jovian planets, a single eccentric Jovian planet, or a
massive brown-dwarf at an inner separation could exist within the cavity.

Title:Particle Acceleration in Mildly Relativistic Outflows of Fast Energetic Transient Sources,"
Abstract:  Recent discovery of fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) as a new class of
energetic transient sources can shed light on the long-standing problem of
supernova-long gamma-ray burst connections. A distinctive feature of such
objects is the presence of modestly relativistic outflows which place them in
between the non-relativistic and relativistic supernovae-related events. Here
we present the results of kinetic particle-in-cell and Monte Carlo simulations
of particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification by shocks with the
velocities in the interval between 0.1 and 0.7 c. These simulations are needed
for the interpretation of the observed broad band radiation of FBOTs. Their
fast, mildly to moderately relativistic outflows may efficiently accelerate
relativistic particles. With particle-in-cell simulations we demonstrate that
synchrotron radiation of accelerated relativistic electrons in the shock
downstream may fit the observed radio fluxes. At longer timescales, well beyond
those reachable within a particle-in-cell approach, our nonlinear Monte Carlo
model predicts that protons and nuclei can be accelerated to petaelectronvolt
(PeV) energies. Therefore, such fast and energetic transient sources can
contribute to galactic populations of high energy cosmic rays.

Title:The Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum Survey. Unveiling the ISM properties of low-$z$ Lyman continuum emitters,"
Abstract:  Combining 66 ultraviolet (UV) spectra and ancillary data from the
Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS) and 23 LyC observations by earlier
studies, we form a statistical sample of star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 0.3$
to study the role of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) gas in the leakage of
ionizing radiation. We first constrain the massive star content (ages and
metallicities) and UV attenuation, by fitting the stellar continuum with a
combination of simple stellar population models. The models, together with
accurate LyC flux measurements, allow to determine the absolute LyC photon
escape fraction for each galaxy ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}$). We measure the
equivalent widths and residual fluxes of multiple HI and low-ionization state
(LIS) lines, and the geometrical covering fraction adopting the picket-fence
model. The $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}$ spans a wide range, with a median (0.16,
0.84 quantiles) of 0.04 (0.02, 0.20), and 50 out of the 89 galaxies detected in
the LyC. The HI and LIS line equivalent widths scale with the UV luminosity and
attenuation, and inversely with the residual flux of the lines. The HI and LIS
residual fluxes are correlated, indicating that the neutral gas is spatially
traced by the LIS transitions. We find the observed trends of the absorption
lines and the UV attenuation are primarily driven by the covering fraction. The
non-uniform gas coverage demonstrates that LyC photons escape through
low-column density channels in the ISM. The equivalent widths and residual
fluxes of the UV lines strongly correlate with $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}$: strong
LyC leakers show weak absorption lines, low UV attenuation, and large
Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths. We finally show that simultaneous UV absorption
line and dust attenuation measurements can predict, on average, the escape
fraction of galaxies and the method can be applied to galaxies across a wide
redshift range.

Title:A Digital Calibration Source for 21cm Cosmology Telescopes,"
Abstract:  Foreground mitigation is critical to all next-generation radio
interferometers that target cosmology using the redshifted neutral hydrogen 21
cm emission line. Attempts to remove this foreground emission has led to new
analysis techniques as well as new developments in hardware specifically
dedicated to instrument beam and gain calibration, including stabilized signal
injection into the interferometric array and drone-based platforms for beam
mapping. The radio calibration sources currently used in the literature are
broad-band incoherent sources that can only be detected as excess power and
with no direct sensitivity to phase information. In this paper, we describe a
digital radio source which uses Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) derived time
stamps to form a deterministic signal that can be broadcast from an aerial
platform. A copy of this source can be deployed locally at the instrument
correlator such that the received signal from the aerial platform can be
correlated with the local copy, and the resulting correlation can be measured
in both amplitude and phase for each interferometric element. We describe an
initial implementation and verification of this source using commercial boards,
and suggest a further upgrade that takes advantage of new, fast Xilinx Radio
Frequency System-on-a-Chip (RFSoCs).

Title:Constraining Global Coronal Models with Multiple Independent Observables,"
Abstract:  Global coronal models seek to produce an accurate physical representation of
the Sun's atmosphere which can be used, for example, to drive space weather
models. Assessing their accuracy is a complex task and there are multiple
observational pathways to provide constraints and tune model parameters. Here,
we combine several such independent constraints, defining a model-agnostic
framework for standardized comparison. We require models to predict the
distribution of coronal holes at the photosphere, and neutral line topology at
the model outer boundary. We compare these predictions to extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) observations of coronal hole locations, white-light Carrington maps of
the streamer belt and the magnetic sector structure measured \textit{in situ}
by Parker Solar Probe and 1AU spacecraft. We study these metrics for Potential
Field Source Surface (PFSS) models as a function of source surface height and
magnetogram choice, as well as comparing to the more physical Wang-Sheeley-Arge
(WSA) and the Magnetohydrodynamics Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) models. We
find that simultaneous optimization of PFSS models to all three metrics is not
currently possible, implying a trade-off between the quality of representation
of coronal holes and streamer belt topology. WSA and MAS results show the
additional physics they include addresses this by flattening the streamer belt
while maintaining coronal hole sizes, with MAS also improving coronal hole
representation relative to WSA. We conclude that this framework is highly
useful for inter- and intra-model comparisons. Integral to the framework is the
standardization of observables required of each model, evaluating different
model aspects.

intensity over the observation period. The resulting data set is highly
complementary to other CHIME beam measurements -- both in terms of angular
coverage and systematics -- and plays an important role in the ongoing program

Abstract:  We describe realistic observing scenarios for early warning detection of

gravitational-wave detectors as these approach design sensitivity. Using Fisher
analysis, we estimate that Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will detect one
signal before merger in their fourth observing run provided they maintain a
70\% duty cycle. 60\% of all observations and 8\% of those detectable 20
seconds before merger will be localized to $\lesssim 100 \thinspace
\mathrm{deg}^2$. If KAGRA is able to achieve a 25 Mpc horizon, these prospects
increase to $\lesssim 2$ early detections with 70\% of all BNS localized to
$\lesssim 100 \thinspace \mathrm{deg}^2$ by merger. As the AHKLV network
approaches design sensitivity over the next $\sim10$ years, we expect up to 1
(14) detections made 100 (10) seconds before merger. Although adding detectors
to the HLV network impacts the detection rate at $\lesssim 50\%$ level, it
improves localization prospects and increases the completeness of compact
binary surveys. Given uncertainties in sensitivities, participating detectors,
and duty cycles, we consider 103 future detector configurations so
electromagnetic observers can tailor preparations towards their preferred
models.

Title:Identifying Blue Large Amplitude Pulsators from Gaia DR2 & ZTF DR3,"
Abstract:  Blue Large Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are hot, subluminous stars undergoing
rapid variability with periods of under 60 mins. They have been linked with the
early stages of pre-white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs. They are a rare class of
variable star due to their evolutionary history within interacting binary
systems and the short timescales relative to their lifetime in which they are
pulsationally unstable. All currently known BLAPs are relatively faint (15-19
mag) and are located in the Galactic plane. These stars have intrinsically blue
colours but the large interstellar extinction in the Galactic plane prevents
them from swift identification using colour-based selection criteria. In this
paper, we correct the Gaia $G$-band apparent magnitude and
$G_{\mathrm{BP}}-G_{\mathrm{RP}}$ colours of 89.6 million sources brighter than
19 mag in the Galactic plane with good quality photometry combined with
supplementary all-sky data totalling 162.3 million sources. Selecting sources
with colours consistent with the known population of BLAPs and performing a
cross-match with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR3, we identify 98 short
period candidate variables. Manual inspection of the period-folded light curves
reveals 22 candidate BLAPs. Of these targets, 6 are consistent with the
observed periods and light curves of the known BLAPs, 10 are within the
theoretical period range of BLAPs and 6 are candidate high-gravity BLAPs. We
present follow-up spectra of 21 of these candidate sources and propose to
classify 1 of them as a BLAP, and tentatively assign an additional 8 of them as
BLAPs for future population studies.

we allow to vary some model parameters among the two spectral bands. Motivated
by this result, we produced new SEDs using the radiative transfer code SKIRT.

and polar exponent of the power-law density profile, opacity, and viewing
angle. Furthermore, we also test the dust grains size and different optical and

two concentric components with outer radii of 1.8 and 28 pc, respectively. We

silicate grains in the dust structure are key to reproduce the spectra of
NGC1068. We conclude that the dust in NGC1068 reaches different scales, where
the highest contribution to the mid-infrared is given by a central and compact
component. A less dense and extended component is present, which can be either
part of the same torus (conforming a flared disk) or can represent the emission
of a polar dust component, as already suggested from interferometric
observations.

Title:On-orbit Performance of the Spitzer Space Telescope: Science Meets Engineering,"
Abstract:  The Spitzer Space Telescope operated for over 16 years in an Earth-trailing
solar orbit, returning not only a wealth of scientific data but, as a
by-product, spacecraft and instrument engineering data which will be of
interest to future mission planners. These data will be particularly useful
because Spitzer operated in an environment essentially identical to that at the
L2 LaGrange point where many future astrophysics missions will operate. In
particular, the radiative cooling demonstrated by Spitzer has been adopted by
other infrared space missions, from JWST to SPHEREx. This paper aims to
facilitate the utility of the Spitzer engineering data by collecting the more
unique and potentially useful portions into a single, readily-accessible
publication. We avoid discussion of less unique systems, such as the telecom,
flight software, and electronics systems and do not address the innovations in
mission and science operations which the Spitzer team initiated. These and
other items of potential interest are addressed in references supplied in an
appendix to this paper.

Title:Monitoring inner regions in the RY Tau jet,"
Abstract:  We present multi-epoch observations of the RY~Tau jet for H$\alpha$ and
[\ion{Fe}{2}] 1.644 \micron~emission lines obtained with
Subaru/SCExAO+VAMPIRES, Gemini/NIFS, and Keck/OSIRIS in 2019--2021. These data
show a series of four knots within 1$\arcsec$ consistent with the proper motion
of $\sim$0\farcs3~yr$^{-1}$, analogous to the jets associated with another few
active T-Tauri stars. However, the spatial intervals between the knots suggest
the time intervals of the ejections of about 1.2, 0.7, and 0.7 years,
significantly shorter than those estimated for the other stars. These H$\alpha$
images contrast with the archival VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL observations from 2015,
which showed only a single knot-like feature at $\sim0\farcs25$. The difference
between the 2015 and 2019--2021 epochs suggests an irregular ejection interval
within the six-year range. Such variations of the jet ejection may be related
to a short-term ($<$1 year) variability of the mass accretion rate. We compared
the peaks of the H$\alpha$ emissions with the ZIMPOL data taken in 2015,
showing the brighter profile at the base ($<0\farcs3$) than the 2020--2021
VAMPIRES profiles due to time-variable mass ejection rates or the
heating-cooling balance in the jet. The observed jet knot structures may be
alternatively attributed to stationary shocks, but a higher angular resolution
is required to confirm its detailed origin.

Title:Peculiar disk behaviors of the black hole candidate MAXI J1348-630 in the hard state observed by Insight-HXMT and Swift,"
Abstract:  We present a spectral study of the black hole candidate MAXI J1348-630 during
its 2019 outburst, based on monitoring observations with Insight-HXMT and
Swift. Throughout the outburst, the spectra are well fitted with power-law plus
disk-blackbody components. In the soft-intermediate and soft states, we
observed the canonical relation L ~ T_in^4 between disk luminosity L and peak
colour temperature T_in, with a constant inner radius R_in (traditionally
identified with the innermost stable circular orbit). At other stages of the
outburst cycle, the behaviour is more unusual, inconsistent with the canonical
outburst evolution of black hole transients. In particular, during the hard
rise, the apparent inner radius is smaller than in the soft state (and
increasing), and the peak colour temperature is higher (and decreasing). This
anomalous behaviour is found even when we model the spectra with
self-consistent Comptonization models, which take into account the
up-scattering of photons from the disk component into the power-law component.
To explain both those anomalous trends at the same time, we suggest that the
hardening factor for the inner disk emission was larger than the canonical
value of ~1.7 at the beginning of the outburst. A more physical trend of radii
and temperature evolution requires a hardening factor evolving from ~3.5 at the
beginning of the hard state to ~1.7 in the hard intermediate state. This could
be evidence that the inner disk was in the process of condensing from the hot,
optically thin medium and had not yet reached a sufficiently high optical depth
for its emission spectrum to be described by the standard optically-thick disk
solution.

Title:The Magnetic Field in the Milky Way Filamentary Bone G47,"
Abstract:  Star formation primarily occurs in filaments where magnetic fields are
expected to be dynamically important. The largest and densest filaments trace
spiral structure within galaxies. Over a dozen of these dense
($\sim$10$^4$\,cm$^{-3}$) and long ($>$10\,pc) filaments have been found within
the Milky Way, and they are often referred to as ""bones."" Until now, none of
these bones have had their magnetic field resolved and mapped in their
entirety. We introduce the SOFIA legacy project FIELDMAPS which has begun
mapping $\sim$10 of these Milky Way bones using the HAWC+ instrument at
214\,$\mu$m and 18$\farcs$2 resolution. Here we present a first result from
this survey on the $\sim$60\,pc long bone G47. Contrary to some studies of
dense filaments in the Galactic plane, we find that the magnetic field is often
not perpendicular to the spine (i.e., the center-line of the bone). Fields tend
to be perpendicular in the densest areas of active star formation and more
parallel or random in other areas. The average field is neither parallel or
perpendicular to the Galactic plane nor the bone. The magnetic field strengths
along the spine typically vary from $\sim$20 to $\sim$100\,$\mu$G. Magnetic
fields tend to be strong enough to suppress collapse along much of the bone,
but for areas that are most active in star formation, the fields are notably
less able to resist gravitational collapse.

Title:Chromospheric emission from nanoflare heating in RADYN simulations,"
Abstract:  Heating signatures from small-scale magnetic reconnection events in the solar
atmosphere have proven to be difficult to detect through observations.
Numerical models that reproduce flaring conditions are essential in the
understanding of how nanoflares may act as a heating mechanism of the corona.
We study the effects of non-thermal electrons in synthetic spectra from 1D
hydrodynamic RADYN simulations of nanoflare heated loops to investigate the
diagnostic potential of chromospheric emission from small-scale events. The Mg
II h and k, Ca II H and K, Ca II 854.2 nm, H-alpha and H-beta chromospheric
lines were synthesised from various RADYN models of coronal loops subject to
electron beams of nanoflare energies. The contribution function to the line
intensity was computed to better understand how the atmospheric response to the
non-thermal electrons affects the formation of spectral lines and the detailed
shape of their spectral profiles. The spectral line signatures arising from the
electron beams highly depend on the density of the loop and the lower cutoff
energy of the electrons. Low-energy (5 keV) electrons deposit their energy in
the corona and transition region, producing strong plasma flows that cause both
redshifts and blueshifts of the chromospheric spectra. Higher-energy (10 and 15
keV) electrons deposit their energy in the lower transition region and
chromosphere, resulting in increased emission from local heating. Our results
indicate that effects from small-scale events can be observed with ground-based
telescopes, expanding the list of possible diagnostics for the presence and
properties of nanoflares.

Title:One spectrum to cure them all: Signature from early Universe solves major anomalies and tensions in cosmology,"
Abstract:  Acoustic peaks in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature spectrum
as observed by the Planck satellite appear to be smoother than our expectation
from the standard model lensing effect. This anomalous effect can be also
mimicked by a spatially closed Universe with a very low value of Hubble
constant that consequently aggravates the already existing discordance between
cosmological observations. We reconstruct a signature from the early Universe,
a particular form of oscillation in the primordial spectrum of quantum
fluctuations with a characteristic frequency, that solves all these anomalies.
Interestingly, we find this form of the primordial spectrum resolves or
substantially subsides, various tensions in the standard model of cosmology in
fitting different observations, namely Planck CMB, clustering and weak lensing
shear measurements from several large scale structure surveys, local
measurements of Hubble constant, and recently estimated age of the Universe
from globular clusters. We support our findings phenomenologically, by
proposing an analytical form of the primordial spectrum with similar features
and demonstrate that it agrees remarkably well with various combinations of
cosmological observations. We support further our findings theoretically, by
introducing a single scalar field potential for inflation that can generate
such a form of the primordial spectrum.

Title:Results of selected stellar spectroscopy programs at the 6-m telescope of SAO RAS performed with the NES echelle spectrograph,"
Abstract:  Over the past two decades the echelle spectrograph NES of the 6-m telescope
was used to perform high resolution spectroscopy of far evolved stars spanning
a wide range of initial masses. The studies cover a diversity of stars with
high mass-loss rates during the preceding and current stages of evolution. All
these stars have extended atmospheres and structured circumstellar envelopes
produced by strong stellar winds. We have studied luminous blue variables near
the Eddington limit; hot supergiants with B[e] phenomenon in spectra, which are
very likely intermediate-mass binary systems soon after the fast mass exchange
stage; a group of yellow hypergiants, as well as an extensive sample of
low-mass post-AGB supergiants. The diverse nature of the types of these stars
whose common feature is the presence of a circumstellar envelope makes the
spectroscopy of such objects a comprehensive task. Such studies consist of many
etapes, which include not only determining the peculiarities of their
atmospheric chemical composition and understanding the role of supergiants in
the enrichment of the interstellar medium with freshly synthesized elements,
but also the determination of the evolution status of the objects considered,
as well as search for and analysis of spectroscopic manifestations of kinematic
processes in their extended and unstable atmospheres and gas-dust envelopes. We
spectroscopically monitored selected objects to study in detail the instability
of the kinematic state of the atmospheres of the stars considered. This review
reports briefly the most significant observational obtained within the
framework of the programs in 1998--2021.

Title:Contribution to the extragalactic neutrino background from dense environment of GRB jets,"
Abstract:  Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are at present well confirmed sites of
acceleration of particles to relativistic energies due to observations of
gamma-ray emission in the GeV-TeV energy range. We consider a scenario in which
the mechanism accelerating electrons is also responsible for acceleration of
hadrons in the GRB jets to multi-PeV energies. Since progenitors of long GRBs
are massive stars still immersed in dense stellar clusters, these hadrons can
efficiently interact with the matter after escaping from the jet. We calculate
the spectra of neutrinos from the interaction of those hadrons with the matter
of a huge cloud surrounding GRB. Those neutrinos form an afterglow on a time
scale determined by their diffusion time scale in the cloud. Due to this long
delay, their identification with any specific GRB is not possible. We estimate
contribution of neutrinos from such afterglows to the extragalactic neutrino
background recently reported by the IceCube Observatory.

Title:A$^{3}$COSMOS: A census on the molecular gas mass and extent of main-sequence galaxies across cosmic time,"
Abstract:  To constrain for the first time the mean mass and extent of the molecular gas
of a mass-complete sample of $>10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$ main-sequence (MS) galaxies
at $0.4<z<3.6$. We apply an innovative $uv$-based stacking analysis to a large
set of archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
observations. This stacking analysis provides measurements of the mean mass and
extent of the molecular gas of galaxy populations. The molecular gas mass of MS
galaxies evolves with redshift and stellar mass. At all stellar masses, the
molecular gas fraction decreases by a factor of 24 from $z\sim3.2$ to $z\sim0$.
At a given redshift, the molecular gas fraction of MS galaxies decreases with
stellar mass, at roughly the same rate as their specific star formation rate
decreases. The molecular gas depletion time of MS galaxies remains roughly
constant at $z>0.5$ with a value of 300--500 Myr, but increases by a factor of
3 from $z\sim0.5$ to $z\sim0$. This evolution of the molecular gas depletion
time of MS galaxies can be predicted from the evolution of their molecular gas
surface density and a seemingly universal MS-only $\Sigma_{M_{\rm
mol}}-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation with an inferred slope of 1.13, i.e., the
so-called KS relation. The far-infrared size of MS galaxies shows no
significant evolution with redshift or stellar mass, with a mean circularized
half-light radius of 2.2 kpc. Finally, our mean molecular gas masses are lower
than previous estimates, likely caused by the fact that literature studies were
biased towards individually-detected MS galaxies with massive gas reservoirs.
To first order, the molecular gas content of MS galaxies regulates their star
formation across cosmic time, while variation of their star formation
efficiency plays a secondary role. Despite a large evolution of their gas
content and SFRs, MS galaxies evolved along a seemingly universal MS-only KS
relation.

Title:A multi-transition methanol maser study of the accretion burst source G358.93-0.03-MM1,"
Abstract:  We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter
wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst
epochs. A unique, NIR/(sub)mm-dark and FIR-loud MYSO accretion burst was
recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an
unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of
three of the newly-discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are
presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers
at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in
all detected transitions resides in a region of $\sim$0.2$^{\prime\prime}$
around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the
north-south direction, with red-shifted features to the north and blue-shifted
features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing
region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I
evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition
from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The
comparison of our results with the complementary VLA, VLBI, SMA, and ALMA maser
data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of
the presence of spiral-arm structures within the accretion disk, which was
suggested in previous studies of the source.

Title:Dust entrainment in photoevaporative winds: Synthetic observations of transition disks,"
Abstract:  X-ray- and extreme-ultraviolet- (XEUV-) driven photoevaporative winds acting
on protoplanetary disks around young T-Tauri stars may strongly impact disk
evolution, affecting both gas and dust distributions. We compute dust densities
for the wind regions of XEUV-irradiated transition disks with gap sizes of 20
and 30 AU, and determine whether they can be observed at wavelengths $0.7
\lesssim \lambda_\mathrm{obs} [\mu\mathrm{m}] \lesssim 1.8$ in scattered and
polarised light with current instrumentation. For an XEUV-driven outflow around
a $M_* = 0.7 \mathrm{M}_\odot$ T-Tauri star with $L_X = 2 \cdot 10^{30}
\mathrm{erg/s}$, we find dust mass-loss rates $\dot{M}_\mathrm{dust} \lesssim
2.0 \cdot 10^{-3} \dot{M}_\mathrm{gas}$, and if we invoke vertical settling,
the outflow is quite collimated. The synthesised images exhibit a distinct
chimney-like structure. The relative intensity of these chimneys is low, but
under optimal conditions, their detection may still be feasible with current
instrumentation such as JWST NIRCam and SPHERE IRDIS.

Title:X-ray variability of HD 189733 across eight years of XMM-Newton observations,"
Abstract:  The characterization of exoplanets, their formation, evolution, and chemical
changes is tightly linked to our knowledge of their host stars. In particular,
stellar X-rays and UV emission have a strong impact on the dynamical and
chemical evolution of planetary atmospheres. We analyzed 25 XMM-Newton
observations encompassing about eight years and totaling about 958 ks in order
to study the X-ray emission of HD 189733 A. We find that the corona of HD
189733 A has an average temperature of 0.4 keV and it is only during flares
that the mean temperature increases to 0.9 keV. Apart from the flares, there is
no significant change in the flux and hardness of the coronal emission on a
timescale of several months to years. Thus, we conclude that there is no
detectable activity cycle on such timescales. We identified the flares and
built their energy distribution. The number of flares observed around the
phases of the planetary eclipses is not statistically different from the number
of flares during transit phases. However, we do find a hint of a difference in
the flare-energy distributions, as the flares observed around the planetary
eclipses tend to be more energetic than the flares observed around the primary
transits of the planet. We modeled the distribution of the number of flares per
day with a power law, showing that it is steeper than the one observed in the
Sun and in other Main Sequence stars. The steepness hints at a significant
fraction of undetected micro-flares. Altogether, the plasma temperatures below
1 keV observed during the flares, along with the slightly larger fraction of
energetic flares seen at the secondary transits highlight the peculiarity of
the corona of HD 189733 A and points to star-planet interaction as the
plausible origin of part of its X-ray emission. However, more observational and
modeling efforts are required to confirm or disprove this scenario.

Title:Nothing to see here: Failed supernovae are faint or rare,"
Abstract:  The absence of Type IIP core-collapse supernovae arising from progenitors
above 17 solar masses suggests the existence of another evolutionary path by
which massive stars end their lives. The direct collapse of a stellar core to a
black hole without the production of a bright, explosive transient is expected
to produce a long-lived, dim, red transient known as a failed supernova.
Despite the detection of a number of candidates for disappearing massive stars
in recent years, conclusive observational evidence for failed supernovae
remains elusive. A custom-built pipeline designed for the detection of faint
transients is used to re-analyse 10 years of observations of 231 nearby
galaxies from the PTF/ZTF surveys. This analysis recovers known supernovae, and
yields a number of interesting transients. However, none of these are
consistent with a failed supernova. Through Monte Carlo tests the recovery
efficiency of our pipeline is quantified. By assuming failed supernovae occur
as a Poissonian process with zero detections in the data set, 95 per cent upper
limits to the rate of failed supernovae are calculated as a function of failed
supernova absolute magnitude. We estimate failed supernovae to be less than
0.61, 0.33, 0.26, or 0.23 of the core-collapse SN rate for absolute magnitudes
of $-11$, $-12$, $-13$, and $-14$ respectively. Finally, we show that if they
exist, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will find 1.7 - 3.7 failed SNe per year
for an absolute bolometric luminosity of $\sim 6 \times 10^{39} \textrm{ erg
s}^{-1}$ out to distances of 33 - 43 Mpc, depending on their assumed spectral
energy distribution.

Abstract:  On April 13, 2029, asteroid Apophis will pass within six Earth radii
($\sim$31000 km above surface), in the closest approach of this asteroid in
recorded history. This event provides unique scientific opportunities to study
the asteroid, its orbit, and surface characteristics at an exceptionally close
distance. In this paper we perform a synthetic geometrical, geographical and
temporal analysis of the conditions under which the asteroid can be observed
from Earth, with a particular emphasis on the conditions and scientific
opportunities for bistatic radar observations, the most feasible radar
technique applicable during such a close approach. For this purpose, we compile
a list of present and future radio observatories around the globe which could
participate in bistatic radar observation campaigns during the closest approach
of Apophis. We estimate signal-to-noise ratios, apparent sky rotation, surface
coverage and other observing conditions. We find that a global collaboration of
observatories across Australia, Africa, Europe and America will produce
high-resolution delay-Doppler radar images with signal-to-noise ratios above
$10^8$, while covering $\sim$85\% of the asteroid surface. Moreover, if
properly coordinated, the extreme approach of the asteroid might allow for
radio amateur detection of the signals sent by large radio observatories and
citizen science projects could then be organized. We also find that for visual
observations, the Canary Islands will offer the best observing conditions
during the closest approach, both for professionals as well as for amateurs.
The apparent size of Apophis will be 2-3 times larger than typical seeing,
allowing for resolved images of the surface.

Title:Spectral study of the diffuse synchrotron source in the galaxy cluster Abell 523,"
Abstract:  The galaxy cluster Abell 523 (A523) hosts an extended diffuse synchrotron
source historically classified as a radio halo. Its radio power at 1.4 GHz
makes it one of the most significant outliers in the scaling relations between
observables derived from multi-wavelength observations of galaxy clusters: it
has a morphology that is different and offset from the thermal gas, and it has
polarized emission at 1.4 GHz typically difficult to observe for this class of
sources. A magnetic field fluctuating on large spatial scales (~ 1 Mpc) can
explain these peculiarities but the formation mechanism for this source is not
yet completely clear. To investigate its formation mechanism, we present new
observations obtained with the LOw Frequency ARray at 120-168 MHz and the
Jansky Very Large Array at 1-2 GHz, which allow us to study the spectral index
distribution of this source. According to our data the source is observed to be
more extended at 144 MHz than previously inferred at 1.4 GHz, with a total size
of about 1.8 Mpc and a flux density S_144MHz = (1.52 +- 0.31) Jy. The spectral
index distribution of the source is patchy with an average spectral index alpha
~ 1.2 between 144 MHz and 1.410 GHz, while an integrated spectral index alpha ~
2.1 has been obtained between 1.410 GHz and 1.782 GHz. A previously unseen
patch of steep spectrum emission is clearly detected at 144 MHz in the south of
the cluster. Overall, our findings suggest that we are observing an overlapping
of different structures, powered by the turbulence associated with the primary
and a possible secondary merger.

Title:Early recognition of Microlensing Events from Archival Photometry with Machine Learning Methods,"
Abstract:  Gravitational microlensing method is a powerful method to detect isolated
black holes in the Milky Way. During a microlensing event brightness of the
source increases and this feature is used by many photometric surveys to alert
on potential events. A typical microlensing event shows a characteristic light
curve, however, some outbursting variable stars may show similar light curves
to microlensing events especially when the cadence of observations is not dense
enough. Our aim is to device a method for distinguishing candidates for
microlensing events from any other types of alerts using solely their archival
photometric multi-wavelength data. The most common contaminants in the
microlensing event search are Classical Be-type stars, Young Stellar Objects
and Asymptotic Giant Branch stars such as Miras. We build a training set using
thousands of examples for the main classes of alerting stars combining optical
to mid-infrared magnitudes from Gaia, 2MASS and AllWISE catalogues. We used
supervised machine learning techniques to build models for classification of
alerts. We verified our method on 120 microlensing events reported by Gaia
Science Alerts which were studied spectroscopically and photometrically. With
the use of only archival information at 90% probability threshold we correctly
identified one-third of the microlensing events. We also run our classifier on
positions of 368 Gaia alerts which were flagged as potential candidates for
microlensing events. At the 90% probability threshold we classified 38
microlensing events and 29 other types of variables. The machine learning
supported method we developed can be universally used for current and future
alerting surveys in order to quickly assess the classification of galactic
transients and help decide on further follow-up observations.

Title:The quantum gravity connection between inflation and quintessence,"
Abstract:  Inflation and quintessence can both be described by a single scalar field.
The cosmic time evolution of this cosmon field realizes a crossover from the
region of an ultraviolet fixed point in the infinite past to an infrared fixed
point in the infinite future. This amounts to a transition from early inflation
to late dynamical dark energy, with intermediate radiation and matter
domination. The scaling solution of the renormalization flow in quantum gravity
connects the two fixed points. It provides for the essential characteristics of
the scalar potential needed for the crossover cosmology and solves the
cosmological constant problem dynamically. The quantum scale symmetry at the
infrared fixed point protects the tiny mass of the cosmon and suppresses the
cosmon coupling to atoms without the need of a non-linear screening mechanism,
thereby explaining apparent issues of fine tuning. For a given content of
particles the scaling solution of quantum gravity is a predictive framework for
the properties of inflation and dynamical dark energy.

Title:Constraining changes in the merger history of (P)BH binaries with the stochastic gravitational wave background,"
Abstract:  Black holes binaries coming from a distribution of primordial black holes
might exhibit a large merger rate up to large redshifts. Using a
phenomenological model for the merger rate, we show that changes in its slope,
up to redshifts $z\sim 4$, are constrained by current limits on the amplitude
of the stochastic gravitational wave background from LIGO/Virgo O3 run. This
shows that the stochastic background constrains the merger rate for redshifts
larger than the single event horizon of detection ($z\simeq 1$ for the same
detector). Moreover, we show that for steep merger rates the shape of the
stochastic gravitational wave signal at intermediate frequencies differs from
the usual $2/3$ IR scaling. We discuss the implications of our model for future
experiments in a wide range of frequencies, as the design LIGO/Virgo array,
Einstein Telescope, LISA and PTA. Additionally, we show that i) the stochastic
background and the present merger rate provide equally constraining bounds on
the abundance of PBHs arising from a Gaussian distribution of inhomogeneities
and ii) Degeneracies at the level of the stochastic background (i.e. different
merger histories leading to a similar stochastic background) can be broken by
considering the complementary direct observation of the merger rate from number
counts by future detectors such as the Einstein Telescope.

Title:The Three Hundred project: galaxy cluster mergers and their impact on the stellar component of brightest cluster galaxies,"
Abstract:  Using the data set of The Three Hundred project, i.e. a suite of 324
hydrodynamical resimulations of cluster-sized haloes, we study galaxy cluster
mergers and their effect on colour and luminosity changes of their brightest
cluster galaxies (BCG). We track the main progenitor of each halo at z=0 and
search for merger situations based on its mass accretion history, defining
mergers as very rapid increases in the halo mass. Based upon the evolution of
the dynamical state of the cluster we define a pre- and post-merger phase. We
create a list of all these events and statistically study their mass ratio and
timescales, with the former verifying that all instances are in fact major
mergers. By comparing to a control sample of clusters without mergers, we study
the effect mergers have on the stellar component of the BCG. Analysing the
mass, age and metallicity of the BCG stellar particles, we find that the
stellar content of BCGs grows significantly during mergers and, even though the
main growth mechanism is the accretion of older stars, there is even a burst in
star formation induced by the merger. In our simulations, BCGs in mergers form
in median around 70 per cent more stars than those normally growing, although
this depends on the radius considered for defining the BCG. Regarding
observable properties, we see an increase in SDSS-u luminosity of 20 per cent
during mergers, accompanied by a slightly slower increase of the galaxy g-r
colour as compared to the control sample.

Title:Grids of stellar models with rotation VI: Models from 0.8 to 120 $M_\odot$ at a metallicity Z = 0.006,"
Abstract:  Context: Grids of stellar models, computed with the same physical
ingredients, allow one to study the impact of a given physics on a broad range
of initial conditions and are a key ingredient for modeling the evolution of
galaxies. Aims: We present a grid of single star models for masses between 0.8
and 120 $M_\odot$, with and without rotation for a mass fraction of heavy
element Z=0.006, representative of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Methods:
We used the Geneva stellar evolution code. The evolution was computed until the
end of the central carbon-burning phase, the early asymptotic giant branch
phase, or the core helium-flash for massive, intermediate, and low mass stars,
respectively. Results: The outputs of the present stellar models are well
framed by the outputs of the two grids obtained by our group for metallicities
above and below the one considered here. The models of the present work provide
a good fit to the nitrogen surface enrichments observed during the main
sequence for stars in the LMC with initial masses around 15 $M_\odot$. They
also reproduce the slope of the luminosity function of red supergiants of the
LMC well, which is a feature that is sensitive to the time-averaged mass loss
rate over the red supergiant phase. The most massive black hole that can be
formed from the present models at Z=0.006 is around 55 $M_\odot$. No model in
the range of mass considered will enter into the pair-instability supernova
regime, while the minimal mass to enter the region of pair pulsation
instability is around 60 $M_\odot$ for the rotating models and 85 $M_\odot$ for
the nonrotating ones. Conclusions: The present models are of particular
interest for comparisons with observations in the LMC and also in the outer
regions of the Milky Way. We provide public access to numerical tables that can
be used for computing interpolated tracks and for population synthesis studies.

"Title:FitsMap: A Simple, Lightweight Tool For Displaying Interactive Astronomical Image and Catalog Data","
Abstract:  The visual inspection of image and catalog data continues to be a valuable
aspect of astronomical data analysis. As the scale of astronomical image and
catalog data continues to grow, visualizing the data becomes increasingly
difficult. In this work, we introduce FitsMap, a simple, lightweight tool for
visualizing astronomical image and catalog data. FitsMap only requires a simple
web server and can scale to over gigapixel images with tens of millions of
sources. Further, the web-based visualizations can be viewed performantly on
mobile devices. FitsMap is implemented in Python and is open source
(this https URL).

Title:INTEGRAL contributions to magnetars and multimessenger astrophysics,"
Abstract:  The INTEGRAL satellite, in orbit since October 2002, has significantly
contributed to the study of magnetars and, thanks to its unique capabilities
for the study of transient gamma-ray phenomena, it is now playing an important
role in multimessenger astrophysics. The most recent results include the
discovery of a peculiar burst from SGR J1935+2154, which gave the first
observational evidence for the connection between magnetars and fast radio
bursts, and extensive searches for bursting activity in peculiar sources, such
as the repeating FRB 20200120E in M81 and the ultra-long period magnetar
candidate GLEAMX J162759.5--523504.3.

Title:Three-Body Resonances in the Saturnian System,"
Abstract:  Saturn has a dynamically rich satellite system, which includes at least three
orbital resonances between three pairs of moons: Mimas-Tethys 4:2,
Enceladus-Dione 2:1, and Titan-Hyperion 4:3 mean-motion resonances. Studies of
the orbital history of Saturn's moons usually assume that their past dynamics
was also dominated solely by two-body resonances. Using direct numerical
integrations, we find that three-body resonances among Saturnian satellites
were quite common in the past, and could result in a relatively long-term, but
finite capture time (10 Myr or longer). We find that these three-body
resonances are invariably of the eccentricity type, and do not appear to affect
the moons' inclinations. While some three-body resonances are located close to
two-body resonances (but involve the orbital precession of the third body),
others are isolated, with no two-body arguments being near resonance. We
conclude that future studies of the system's past must take full account of
three-body resonances, which have been overlooked in the past work.

"Title:Another Look at Erupting Minifilaments at the Base of Solar X-Ray Polar Coronal ""Standard"" and ""Blowout"" Jets","
Abstract:  We examine 21 solar polar coronal jets that we identify in soft X-ray images
obtained from the Hinode/X-ray telescope (XRT). We identify 11 of these jets as
blowout jets and four as standard jets (with six uncertain), based on their
X-ray-spire widths being respectively wide or narrow (compared to the jet's
base) in the XRT images. From corresponding Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) images
from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA),
essentially all (at least 20 of 21) of the jets are made by minifilament
eruptions, consistent with other recent studies. Here, we examine the detailed
nature of the erupting minifilaments (EMFs) in the jet bases. Wide-spire
(""blowout"") jets often have ejective EMFs, but sometimes they instead have an
EMF that is mostly confined to the jet's base rather than ejected. We also
demonstrate that narrow-spire (""standard"") jets can have either a confined EMF,
or a partially confined EMF where some of the cool minifilament leaks into the
jet's spire. Regarding EMF visibility: we find that in some cases the
minifilament is apparent in as few as one of the four EUV channels we examined,
being essentially invisible in the other channels; thus it is necessary to
examine images from multiple EUV channels before concluding that a jet does not
have an EMF at its base. The size of the EMFs, measured projected against the
sky and early in their eruption, is 14'' +- 7'', which is within a factor of
two of other measured sizes of coronal-jet EMFs.

"Title:Galaxy flows within 8,000 km/s from Numerical Action methods","
Abstract:  The trajectories since z=4 of systems of galaxies (`halos') with cz < 8,000
km/s are found through Numerical Action reconstructions. A set of 9,719 halos
from a 2MASS group catalog and Cosmicflows-3 catalogs are given attention.
Present distances are adjusted to minimize departures from observed redshifts.
For those with the most precisely determined distances, compromises are made
between distance and redshift agreement. $H_0$ is varied from 69 to 77 km
s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\Omega_m$ set by the baryon acoustic oscillation
constraint from the Planck Satellite. A best fitting amplitude of the
mass-to-light relation is found. A uniform density associated with the
interhalo medium accounts for the matter not in halos. The solution paths
provide the histories of the formation of the nearby large structures and
depict how the voids emptied. Assuming no local over/underdensity, the best
model has $H_0=73$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with nearly the same density arising
from interhalo matter (IHM) as from halos. We examine local over/underdensities
by varying the IHM density and find a valley of best fit models along $H_0 =
73.0 (1 + 0.165\delta)$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Friedmann models with distinct
densities internal and external to the study region give a similar
relationship. The fraction of matter in the IHM seen in n-body simulations
roughly matches that in our $H_0=72$ scenario. Videos have been created to
visualize the complexities of formation of large-scale structures. Standard
n-body calculations starting from the first time-steps as tests of the NAM
solutions, and continue until cosmic scale factor $a=2$ provide glimpses into
the future.

Title:A broadband X-ray study of the asynchronous polar: CD Ind,"
Abstract:  A simultaneous broadband analysis of X-ray data obtained with XMM-Newton and
NuSTAR observatories for the asynchronous polar source CD Ind is presented. The
spin folded lightcurve in soft 0.3-3.0 keV band shows single broad hump-like
structure superimposed with occasional narrow dips, indicating a single-pole
accretion model with a complex intrinsic absorber. Lack of strong modulation in
folded lightcurve above 3 keV reveals that emission from corresponding zone of
post-shock region (PSR) remains in view throughout the spin phase. The
broadband spectrum is modelled with a three-component absorbed plasma emission
model and absorbed isobaric cooling flow model, both of which fit the data well
with similar statistical significance. Presence of partial covering absorber is
evident in the spectra with equivalent column density
$\sim7\times10^{22}\;\text{cm}^{-2}$ and a covering fraction of $\sim 25\%$.
Strong ionised oxygen K$_{\alpha}$ line emission is detected in the spectra. We
notice spectral variability during spin phase 0.75-1.05, when there is a
considerable increase in column density of overall absorber (from $\sim 1
\times 10^{20}\;\text{cm}^{-2}$ to $\sim 9 \times 10^{20}\;\text{cm}^{-2}$). We
required at least three plasma temperatures to describe the multi-temperature
nature of the PSR. The shock temperature $\sim 43.3_{-3.4}^{+3.8}$ keV,
represented by the upper temperature of the cooling flow model, implies a white
dwarf mass of $\sim 0.87^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\;M_{\odot}$. The iron K$_{\alpha}$
line complex shows a strong He-like and a weak neutral fluorescence line. We
could not unambiguously detect the presence of Compton reflection in the
spectra, which is probably very small and signifying a tall shock height.

Title:X-ray emission from star cluster winds in starburst galaxies,"
Abstract:  Inspired by the excess soft X-ray emission recently detected in Green Pea
galaxies, we model the soft X-ray emission (0.5 - 2.0 keV) of hot gas from star
cluster winds. By combining individual star clusters, we estimate the soft
X-ray emission expected from the typically unresolved diffuse hot gas in
starburst galaxies, devoid of competing emission from e.g., AGN or other
unresolved point sources. We use stellar models of sub-solar metallicities
(0.02 $Z_{\odot}$ and 0.4 $Z_{\odot}$), and take into account supernova
explosions for massive stars. For lower metallicities, we find that stellar
winds do not contribute significantly ($\lesssim 3$ % of the mechanical energy)
to the observed soft X-ray emission of normal star forming galaxies. For higher
metallicities and possibly also for larger proportions of massive star clusters
in the simulated starburst galaxies, we reproduce well the observed correlation
between star formation rate and X-ray luminosity previously reported in the
literature. However, we find that no combination of model assumptions is
capable of reproducing the substantial soft X-ray emission observed from Green
Pea galaxies, indicating that other emission mechanisms (i.e. unusually large
quantities of High-/Low-Mass X-ray Binaries, Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources, a
modified initial mass function, Intermediate-Mass Black Holes, or AGN) are more
likely to be responsible for the X-ray excess.

Title:Search for megaparsec giant radio sources from TGSS,"
Abstract:  One of the great astrophysical radio structures in the Universe is giant
radio sources (GRSs) which have a linear projected size of nearly 0.7 Mpc or
more. We systematically search for giant radio galaxies from the TIFR GMRT Sky
Survey Alternative Data Release 1 (TGSS ADR1) at 150 MHz. Our search area
covers 36,900 square degrees of the sky between $-$53 deg and +90 deg DEC,
which is 90 per cent of the total sky. We have identified 53 GRSs with a linear
size range between 0.7 Mpc to 1.82 Mpc. We study characteristic parameters like
identification of candidates, angular and projected linear size, redshift,
spectral index, radio power, and black hole mass of GRSs. Among listed sources,
four giant radio sources have sizes above 1.5 Mpc and one has a size of $\sim$
1.82 Mpc. We also find that one giant radio galaxy (GRG) is situated in a dense
galaxy cluster environment, which is identified by using optical data.

Title:The Link between Hot and Cool Outflows,"
Abstract:  The link between hot and cool stellar outflows is shown to be critical for
correctly predicting the masses of the most massive black holes (BHs) below the
so-called pair-instability supernova (PISN) mass gap. Gravitational Wave (GW)
event 190521 allegedly hosted an ""impossibly"" heavy BH of 85 Solar Masses. Here
we show how our increased knowledge of both metallicity Z and temperature
dependent mass loss is critical for our evolutionary scenario of a low-Z blue
supergiant (BSG) progenitor of an initially approx 100 Solar Masses star to
work. We show using MESA stellar evolution modelling experiments that as long
as we can keep such stars above 8000 K such low-Z BSGs can avoid strong winds,
and keep a very large envelope mass intact before core collapse. This naturally
leads to the Cosmic Time dependent maximum BH function below the PISN gap.

Title:Detection of a Superluminous Spiral Galaxy in the Heart of a Massive Galaxy Cluster,"
Abstract:  It is well established that brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), residing in
the center of galaxy clusters, are typically massive and quenched galaxies with
cD or elliptical morphology. An optical survey suggested that an exotic galaxy
population, superluminous spiral and lenticular galaxies could be the BCGs of
some galaxy clusters. Because the cluster membership and the centroid of a
cluster cannot be accurately determined based solely on optical data, we
followed up a sample of superluminous disk galaxies and their environment using
XMM-Newton X-ray observations. Specifically, we explored seven superluminous
spiral and lenticular galaxies that are candidate BCGs. We detected massive
galaxy clusters around five superluminous disk galaxies and established that
one superluminous spiral, 2MASX J16273931+3002239, is the central BCG of a
galaxy cluster. The temperature and total mass of the cluster are $kT_{\rm
500}=3.55^{+0.18}_{-0.20}$ keV and $M_{\rm 500} = (2.39 \pm 0.19) \times
10^{14} \ \rm{M_{\odot}} $. We identified the central galaxies of the four
clusters that do not host the superluminous disk galaxy at their cores and
established that the centrals are massive elliptical galaxies. However, for two
of the clusters, the offset superluminous spirals are brighter than the central
galaxies, implying that the superluminous disk galaxies are the brightest
cluster galaxies. Our results demonstrate that superluminous disk galaxies are
rarely the central systems of galaxy clusters. This is likely because galactic
disks are destroyed by major mergers, which are more frequent in high-density
environments. We speculate that the disks of superluminous disk galaxies in
cluster cores may have been re-formed due to mergers with a gas-rich satellite.

Title:Cosmological Fast Optical Transients with the Zwicky Transient Facility: A Search for Dirty Fireballs,"
Abstract:  Dirty fireballs are a hypothesized class of relativistic massive-star
explosions with an initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma_\mathrm{init}$ below the
$\Gamma_\mathrm{init}\sim100$ required to produce a long-duration gamma-ray
burst (LGRB), but which could still produce optical emission resembling LGRB
afterglows. Here we present the results of a search for on-axis optical
afterglows using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Our search yielded seven
optical transients that resemble on-axis LGRB afterglows in terms of their red
colors ($g-r>0$ mag), faint host galaxy ($r>23$ mag), and rapid fading
($dr/dt>1$ mag/day). Spectroscopy of the transient emission within a few days
of discovery established cosmological distances ($z=0.876$ to $z=2.9$) for six
events, tripling the number of afterglows with redshift measurements discovered
by optical surveys without a $\gamma$-ray trigger. Upon a retrospective search,
four events (ZTF20abbiixp/AT2020kym, ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv,
ZTF21aakruew/AT2021cwd, ZTF21abfmpwn/AT2021qbd) turned out to have a likely
associated LGRB (GRB200524A, GRB210204A, GRB210212B, GRB210610B), while three
did not (ZTF20aajnksq/AT2020blt, ZTF21aaeyldq/AT2021any,
ZTF21aayokph/AT2021lfa). Our search revealed no definitive new class of events:
the simplest explanation for the apparently ""orphan"" events is that they were
regular LGRBs missed by high-energy satellites due to detector sensitivity and
duty cycle, although it is possible that they were intrinsically faint in
$\gamma$-rays or viewed slightly off-axis. We rule out a scenario in which
dirty fireballs have a similar energy per solid angle to LGRBs and are an order
of magnitude more common. In addition, we set the first direct constraint on
the ratio of the opening angles of the material producing $\gamma$-rays and the
material producing early optical afterglow emission, finding that they must be
comparable.

Title:Hydrodynamics of Collisions and Close Encounters between Stellar Black Holes and Main-sequence Stars,"
Abstract:  Recent analyses have shown that close encounters between stars and stellar
black holes occur frequently in dense star clusters. Depending upon the
distance at closest approach, these interactions can lead to dissipating
encounters such as tidal captures and disruptions, or direct physical
collisions, all of which may be accompanied by bright electromagnetic
transients. In this study, we perform a wide range of hydrodynamic simulations
of close encounters between black holes and main-sequence stars that
collectively cover the parameter space of interest, and we identify and
classify the various possible outcomes. In the case of nearly head-on
collisions, the star is completely disrupted with roughly half of the stellar
material becoming bound to the black hole. For more distant encounters near the
classical tidal-disruption radius, the star is only partially disrupted on the
first pericenter passage. Depending upon the interaction details, the partially
disrupted stellar remnant may be tidally captured by the black hole or become
unbound (in some cases, receiving a sufficiently large impulsive kick from
asymmetric mass loss to be ejected from its host cluster). In the former case,
the star will undergo additional pericenter passages before ultimately being
disrupted fully. Based on the properties of the material bound to the black
hole at the end of our simulations (in particular, the total bound mass and
angular momentum), we comment upon the expected accretion process and
associated electromagnetic signatures that are likely to result.

Title:The Galactic Dust-Up: Modeling Dust Evolution in FIRE,"
Abstract:  Recent strides have been made developing dust evolution models for galaxy
formation simulations but these approaches vary in their assumptions and degree
of complexity. Here we introduce and compare two separate dust evolution models
(labelled 'Elemental' and 'Species'), based on recent approaches, incorporated
into the GIZMO code and coupled with FIRE-2 stellar feedback and ISM physics.
Both models account for turbulent dust diffusion, stellar production of dust,
dust growth via gas-dust accretion, and dust destruction from time-resolved
supernovae, thermal sputtering in hot gas, and astration. The ""Elemental"" model
tracks the evolution of generalized dust species and utilizes a simple,
'tunable' dust growth routine, while the ""Species"" model tracks the evolution
of specific dust species with set chemical compositions and incorporates a
physically motivated, two-phase dust growth routine. We test and compare these
models in an idealized Milky Way-mass galaxy and find that while both produce
reasonable galaxy-integrated dust-to-metals (D/Z) ratios and predict gas-dust
accretion as the main dust growth mechanism, a chemically motivated model is
needed to reproduce the observed scaling relation between individual element
depletions and D/Z with column density and local gas density. We also find the
inclusion of theoretical metallic iron and O-bearing dust species are needed in
the case of specific dust species in order to match observations of O and Fe
depletions, and the integration of a sub-resolution dense molecular gas/CO
scheme is needed to both match observed C depletions and ensure carbonaceous
dust is not overproduced in dense environments.

Title:The velocity structure of the intracluster medium during a major merger: simulated microcalorimeter observations,"
Abstract:  Major mergers between galaxy clusters can produce large turbulent and bulk
flow velocities in the intra-cluster medium and thus imprint diagnostic
features in X-ray spectral emission lines from heavy ions. As demonstrated by
Hitomi in observations of the Perseus cluster, measurements of gas velocities
in clusters from high-resolution X-ray spectra will be achievable with upcoming
X-ray calorimeters like those on board XRISM, Athena, or a Lynx like mission.
We investigate this possibility for interesting locations across a major
cluster merger from a hydrodynamical simulation, via X-ray synthetic spectra
with a few eV energy resolution. We observe the system from directions
perpendicular to the plane of the merger and along the merger axis. In these
extreme geometrical configurations, we find clear non-Gaussian shapes of the
iron He-like K_alpha line at 6.7keV. The velocity dispersion predicted from the
simulations can be retrieved for the brightest 100ks pointings with XRISM
Resolve, despite some discrepancy related to the complex non-Gaussian line
shapes. Measurements in faint regions require however high S/N and the larger
collecting area of the Athena X-IFU calorimeter is thus needed. With the
latter, we also investigate the gas temperature and velocity gradient across
the merger bow shock edge, from 20""-wide annuli extracted from a single 1Ms
X-IFU pointing. We find best-fit temperature and velocity dispersion values
that are consistent with predictions from the simulations within 1-sigma, but
the uncertainties on the inferred velocity dispersion are too large to place
any stringent constraints on the shallow gradient downstream of the shock. We
also present simulated images of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effects, using the above viewing configurations, and compare the results at
angular resolutions appropriate for future observatories such as CMB-S4 and
AtLAST.

mechanisms, such as the chameleon model, allow the scalar field to be almost
massless on cosmological scales while simultaneously evading laboratory
constraints. We explore the ability of mechanical systems available in the near
term to directly detect the fifth force associated with chameleon dark energy.
We provide analytical expressions for the weakest accessible chameleon model
parameters in terms of experimentally tunable variables and apply our analysis
to two mechanical systems: levitated microspheres and torsion balances, showing
that the current generation of these experiments have the sensitivity to rule
out a significant portion of the proposed chameleon parameter space. We also
indicate regions of theoretically well-motivated chameleon parameter space to

Abstract:  The T Tauri star CVSO30, also known as PTFO8-8695, was studied intensively
with ground based telescopes as well as with satellites over the last decade.
It showed a variable light curve with additional repeating planetary
transit-like dips every ~0.8h. However, these dimming events changed in depth
and duration since their discovery and from autumn 2018 on, they were not even
present or near the predicted observing times. As reason for the detected dips
and their changes within the complex light curve, e.g. a disintegrating planet,
a circumstellar dust clump, stellar spots, possible multiplicity and orbiting
clouds at a Keplerian co-rotating radius were discussed and are still under
debate. In this paper, we present additional optical monitoring of CVSO30 with
the meter class telescopes of the Young Exoplanet Transit Initiative in Asia
and Europe over the last seven years and characterize CVSO30 with the new Early
Data Release 3 of the ESA Gaia Mission. As a result, we describe the evolution
of the dimming events in the optical wavelength range since 2014 and present
explanatory approaches for the observed variabilities. We conclude that
orbiting clouds of gas at a Keplerian co-rotating radius are the most promising
scenario to explain most changes in CVSO30's light curve.

Abstract:  We assume dark matter (DM) to be a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) of

length $a_s \simeq 7.8 \times 10^{-77}$ m. Such small interactions induce a
natural minimum scale length for the size of DM structures that makes all cores
similar in length ($\sim 1$ kpc) and contributes to lower their central
densities.

increasing amount of astronomical data that is available. In this study, we
show, a pedagogical approach that should benefit anyone willing to experiment
with Deep Learning techniques in the context of stellar parameters
determination. Utilizing the Convolutional Neural Network architecture, we give
a step by step overview of how to select the optimal parameters for deriving
the most accurate values for the stellar parameters of stars: T$_{\rm{eff}}$,
$\log g$, [X/H], and $v_e \sin i$. Synthetic spectra with random noise were
used to constrain this method and to mimic the observations. We found that each
stellar parameter requires a different combination of network hyperparameters
and the maximum accuracy reached depends on this combination, as well as, the
Signal to Noise ratio of the observations, and the architecture of the network.
We also show that this technique can be applied to other spectral types in
different wavelength ranges after the technique has been optimized.

Abstract:  We select 52 long gamma-ray bursts(GRBs) having the precursor activity in the
third Swift-BAT catalog. Each episode shown in both the precursors and the main
bursts is fitted by the Norris function. We systematically analyze the temporal
properties for both the precursors and the main bursts. We do not find any
significant difference between the temporal profile of the precursor and that
of the main burst. The photon count of the precursor is related to that of the
main burst. It is indicated that the precursor and the main burst might have
the same physical origin, as the precursor and the main burst follow the same
$\tau_p-\omega$ relation. However, we do not find the explicit relation between
the energy release of the precursor and the quiescent time. Some theoretical

Title:Feeding the Accretion Disk from the Dusty Torus in a Reddened Quasar,"
Abstract:  We present here a detailed analysis of an unusual absorption line system in
the quasar SDSS J122826.79+100532.2. The absorption lines in the system have a
common redshifted velocity structure starting from $v\sim0$ and extending to
$\sim1,000\ \mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$, and are clearly detected in hydrogen Balmer
series up to H$\iota$, in metastable neutral helium triplet, and in optical
lines of excited states of single ionized iron. We estimated that the absorber
has a density $n_{\mathrm{H}}\approx10^{8.4}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and an
ionization parameter $U\approx10^{-1.2}$, thereupon located it at
$r_{\mathrm{abs}}\approx1.5$ pc from the central supermassive black hole. The
inferred distance is remarkably similar to the evaporation radius for dust
grains $r_{\mathrm{evap}}\approx1$ pc in the quasar. Thus the absorber may be a
probe of an inflow starting from the dusty torus and feeding the accretion
disk. Both the featureless continuum and the broad emission lines are heavily
reddened with $E(B-V)\approx0.66$, in contrast to the narrow emission lines
whose reddening is negligible. The dusty medium could be located in between the
broad and narrow emission line regions, and possibly be associated with a
'cold' narrow absorption line system detected in \ion{Ca}{2} and \ion{Na}{1}
doublets nearly unshifted from the quasar systemic velocity. SDSS
J122826.79+100532.2 might represent such a rare case that both the inflow and
the torus could be tracked by absorption lines.

Title:On Detecting Stellar Binary Black Holes via the LISA-Taiji Network,"
Abstract:  The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by ground-based laser
interferometer GW observatories (LIGO/Virgo) reveals a population of stellar
binary black holes (sBBHs) with (total) masses up to $\sim 150M_\odot$, which
are potential sources for space-based GW detectors, such as LISA and Taiji. In
this paper, we investigate in details on the possibility of detecting sBBHs by
the LISA-Taiji network in future. We adopt the sBBH merger rate density
constrained by LIGO/VIRGO observations to randomly generate mock sBBHs samples.
Assuming an observation period of $4$ years, we find that the LISA-Taiji
network may detect several tens (or at least several) sBBHs with
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $>8$ (or $>15$), a factor $2-3$ times larger than
that by only using LISA or Taiji observations. Among these sBBHs, no more than
a few that can merge during the $4$-year observation period. If extending the
observation period to $10$ years, then the LISA-Taiji network may detect about
one hundred (or twenty) sBBHs with SNR $>8$ (or $>15$), among them about twenty
(or at least several) can merge within the observation period. Our results
suggest that the LISA-Taiji network may be able to detect at least a handful to
twenty or more sBBHs even if assuming a conservative SNR threshold ($15$) for
``detection'', which enables multi-band GW observations by space and
ground-based GW detectors. We also further estimate the uncertainties in the
parameter estimations of the sBBH systems ``detected'' by the LISA-Taiji
network. We find that the relative errors in the luminosity distance
measurements and sky localization are mostly in the range of $0.05-0.2$ and
$1-100^2$, respectively, for these sBBHs.

Title:On Dark Gravitational Wave Standard Sirens as Cosmological Inference and Forecasting the Constraint on Hubble Constant using Binary Black Holes Detected by Deci-hertz Observatory,"
Abstract:  Gravitational wave (GW) signals from compact binary coalescences can be used
as standard sirens to constrain cosmological parameters if their redshift can
be measured independently. However, mergers of stellar binary black holes
(BBHs) may not have electromagnetic counterparts and thus have no direct
redshift measurements. These dark sirens may be still used to statistically
constrain cosmological parameters by combining their GW measured luminosity
distances and localization with deep redshift surveys of galaxies around it. We
investigate this dark siren method in detail by using mock BBH and galaxy
samples. We find that the Hubble constant can be constrained well with an
accuracy $\lesssim1\%$ with a few tens or more of BBH mergers at redshift up to
$1$ if GW observations can provide accurate estimates of their luminosity
distance (with relative error of $\lesssim0.01$) and localization
($\lesssim0.1~\rm{deg}^2$), though the constraint may be significantly biased
if the luminosity distance and localization errors are larger. We also
introduce a simple method to correct this bias and find it is valid when the
luminosity distance and localization errors are modestly large. We further
generate mock BBH samples, according to current constraints on BBH merger rate
and the distributions of BBH properties, and find that the Deci-hertz
Observatory (DO) in a half year observation period may detect about one hundred
BBHs with signal-to-noise ratio $\varrho\gtrsim30$, relative luminosity
distance error $\lesssim0.02$, and localization error $\lesssim0.01\rm{deg}^2$.
By applying the dark standard siren method, we find that the Hubble constant
can be constrained to the $\sim0.1-1\%$ level using these DO BBHs, an accuracy
comparable to the constraints obtained by using electromagnetic observations in
the near future, thus it may provide insight into the Hubble tension.

Title:Radiative diffusion in a time-dependent outflow: a model for fast blue optical transients,"
Abstract:  Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) are luminous transients with fast
evolving (typically $t_{\rm rise}<12\ \rm days$) light curve and blue color
(usually $\rm {-0.2\ >\ g-r\ >\ -0.3}$) that cannot be explained by a
supernova-like explosion. We propose a radiative diffusion in a time-dependent
outflow model to interpret such special transients. In this model, we assume a
central engine ejects continuous outflow during a few days. We consider the
ejection of the outflow to be time-dependent. The outflow is optically thick
initially and photons are frozen in it. As the outflow expands over time,
photons gradually escape, and our work is to model such an evolution. Numerical
and analytical calculations are considered separately, and the results are
consistent. We apply the model to three typical FBOTs: PS1-10bjp, ZTF18abukavn,
and ATLAS19dqr. The modeling finds the total mass of the outflow ($\sim 1-5
{M_{\odot}}$), and the total time of the ejection ($\sim$ a few days) for them,
leading us to speculate that they may be the result of the collapse of massive
stars.

Title:Cosmological model-independent measurement of cosmic curvature using distance sum rule with the help of gravitational waves,"
Abstract:  Although the cosmic curvature has been tightly constrained in the standard
cosmological model using observations of cosmic microwave background
anisotropies, it is still of great importance to independently measure this key
parameter using only late-universe observations in a cosmological
model-independent way. The distance sum rule in strong gravitational lensing
(SGL) provides such a way, provided that the three distances in the sum rule
can be calibrated by other observations. In this paper, we propose that
gravitational waves (GWs) can be used to provide the distance calibration in
the SGL method, which can avoid the dependence on distance ladder and cover a
wider redshift range. Using the simulated GW standard siren observation by the
Einstein Telescope as an example, we show that this scheme is feasible and
advantageous. We find that $\Delta\Omega_k\simeq 0.17$ with the current SGL
data, which is slightly more precise than the case of using SN to calibrate.
Furthermore, we consider the forthcoming LSST survey that is expected to
observe many SGL systems, and we find that about $10^4$ SGL data could provide
the precise measurement of $\Delta\Omega_k\simeq 10^{-2}$ with the help of GWs.
In addition, our results confirm that this method of constraining $\Omega_k$ is
strongly dependent on lens models. However, obtaining a more accurate
phenomenological model for lens galaxies is highly predictable as future
massive surveys observe more and more SGL samples, which will significantly
improve the constraint of cosmic curvature.

Title:Thermal energy census with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect of DESI galaxy clusters/groups and its implication on the weak lensing power spectrum,"
Abstract:  We carry out a thermal energy census of hot baryons at $z < 1$, by
cross-correlating the \emph{Planck} MILCA y-map with 0.8 million
clusters/groups selected from the Yang this http URL (2021) catalog. The thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect around these clusters/groups are reliably
obtained, which enables us to make our model constraints based on one-halo (1h)
and two-halo (2h) contributions, respectively. (1) The total measurement S/N of
the one-halo term is 63. We constrain the $Y$-$M$ relation over the halo mass
range of $10^{13}$-$10^{15} M_\odot/h$, and find $Y\propto M^{\alpha}$ with
$\alpha= 1.8$ at $z=0.14$ ($\alpha=2.1$ at $z=0.75$). The total thermal energy
of gas bound to clusters/groups increases from $0.1\ \rm meV/cm^3$ at $z=0.14$
to $0.22\ \rm meV/cm^3$ at $z=0.75$. (2) The two-halo term is used to constrain
the bias-weighted electron pressure $\langle b_yP_e \rangle$. We find that
$\langle b_yP_e \rangle$ (in unit of $\rm meV/cm^3$) increases from $0.24\pm
0.02$ at $z=0.14$ to $0.45\pm 0.02$ at $z=0.75$. These results lead to several
implications. (i) The hot gas fraction $f_{\rm gas}$ in clusters/groups
monotonically increase with halo mass, where $f_{\rm gas}$ of a $10^{14}
M_\odot/h$ halo is $\sim 50\%$ ($25\%$) of the cosmic mean at $z=0.14\ (0.75)$.
(ii) By comparing the 1h- and 2h-terms, we obtain tentative constraint on the
thermal energy of unbound gas. (iii) The above results lead to significant
suppression of matter and weak lensing power spectrum at small scales. These
implications are important for astrophysics and cosmology, and we will further
investigate them with improved data and gas modeling.

Title:Radio emission in a nearby ultracool dwarf binary: a multi-frequency study,"
Abstract:  The substellar triple system VHS J125601.92$-$125723.9 is composed by an
equal-mass M7.5 brown dwarf binary and a L7 low-mass substellar object. In this
work, we aim to identify the origin of the radio emission occurring in the
central binary of VHS 1256$-$1257 while discussing the expected mechanisms
involved in the radio emission of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs). We observed this
system with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the European
very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) Network, the enhanced Multi Element
Remotely Linked Interferometer Network, the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array,
and the Atacama Large Millimetre Array at frequencies ranging from 5 GHz up to
345 GHz in several epochs during 2017, 2018, and 2019. We have found radio
emission at 6 GHz and 33 GHz coincident with the expected position of the
central binary of VHS~1256$-$1257. The Stokes I density flux detected were 73
$\pm$ 4 $\mu$Jy and 83 $\pm$ 13 $\mu$Jy, respectively, with no detectable
circular polarisation or pulses. No emission is detected at higher frequencies
(230 GHz and 345 GHz) nor at 5 GHz with VLBI arrays. The emission appears to be
stable over almost 3 years at 6 GHz. To explain the constraints obtained both
from the detections and non-detections we considered multiple scenarios
including thermal and non-thermal emission, and different contributions from
each component of the binary. Our results can be well explained by non-thermal
gyrosynchrotron emission originating at radiation belts with a low plasma
density (n$_e$ = 300$-$700 cm$^{-3}$), a moderate magnetic field strength (B
$\approx$ 140 G), and an energy distribution of electrons following a power-law
($d N / d E \propto E^{- \delta}$) with $\delta$ fixed at 1.36. These radiation
belts would need to be present in both components and also be viewed
equatorially.

($R_{\rm p} \sim 0.6 - 2.0 R_\oplus$) and orbit stars of various magnitudes
($K_s = 5.78 - 10.78$, $V = 8.4 - 15.69$) and effective temperatures ($T_{\rm

"Title:The mean flow, velocity dispersion, energy transfer and evolution of rotating and growing dark matter halos","
Abstract:  By decomposing velocity dispersion into non-spin and spin-induced, mean flow
and dispersion are analytically solved for axisymmetric rotating and growing
halos. The polar flow can be neglected and azimuthal flow is directly related
to dispersion. The fictitious (""Reynolds"") stress acts on mean flow to enable
energy transfer from mean flow to random motion and maximize system entropy.
For large halos (high peak height $\nu$ at early stage of halo life) with
constant concentration, there exists a self-similar radial flow (outward in
core and inward in outer region). Halo mass, size and specific angular momentum
increase linearly with time via fast mass accretion. Halo core spins faster
than outer region. Large halos rotate with an angular velocity proportional to
Hubble parameter and spin-induced dispersion is dominant. All specific energies
(radial/rotational/kinetic/potential) are time-invariant. Both halo spin
($\sim$0.031) and anisotropic parameters can be analytically derived. For
""small"" halos with stable core and slow mass accretion (low peak height $\nu$
at late stage of halo life), radial flow vanishes. Small halos rotate with
constant angular velocity and non-spin axial dispersion is dominant. Small
halos are spherical in shape, incompressible, and isotropic. Radial and
azimuthal dispersion are comparable and greater than polar dispersion. Due to
finite spin, kinetic energy is not equipartitioned with the greatest energy
along azimuthal direction. Different from normal matter, small halos are hotter
with faster spin. Halo relaxation from early to late stage involves variation
of shape, density, mean flow, momentum, and energy. During relaxation, halo
isotopically ""stretches"" with conserved specific rotational kinetic energy,
increasing concentration and momentum of inertial. Halo ""stretching"" leads to
decreasing angular velocity, increasing angular momentum and spin parameter.

Title:Confirming the 3:2 Resonance Chain of K2-138,"
Abstract:  The study of orbital resonances allows for the constraint of planetary
properties of compact systems. K2-138 is an early K-type star with six planets,
five of which have been proposed to be in the longest chain of 3:2 mean motion
resonances. To observe and potentially verify the resonant behavior of K2-138's

Through our analysis, we find that 99.2% of our simulations result in a chain
of 3:2 resonances, although only 11% of them show a five-planet resonance
chain. We find we are able to use resonances to constrain the orbital periods
and masses of the planets. We explore the possibility of this system forming in
situ and through disk migration, and investigate the potential compositions of
each planet using a planet structure code.

Abstract:  We perform a cosmic shear analysis of HSC survey first-year data (HSC-Y1)
using Complete Orthogonal Sets of E/B-Integrals (COSEBIs) to derive
cosmological constraints. We compute E/B-mode COSEBIs from cosmic shear
two-point correlation functions measured on an angular range of
$4\arcmin<\theta<180\arcmin$. We perform the standard Bayesian likelihood
analysis for cosmological inference from the measured E-mode COSEBIs, including
contributions from intrinsic alignments of galaxies as well as systematic
effects from point spread function model errors, shear calibration
uncertainties, and source redshift distribution errors. We adopt a covariance
matrix derived from realistic mock catalogs constructed from full-sky
gravitational lensing simulations that fully take account of the survey
geometry and measurement noise. For a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, we
find $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.809_{-0.026}^{+0.036}$. We
carefully check the robustness of the cosmological results against
astrophysical modeling uncertainties and systematic uncertainties in
measurements, and find that none of them has a significant impact on the
cosmological constraints. We also find that the measured B-mode COSEBIs are
consistent with zero. We examine, using mock HSC-Y1 data, the consistency of
our $S_8$ constraints with those derived from the other cosmic shear two-point
statistics, the power spectrum analysis by Hikage et al (2019) and the
two-point correlation function analysis by Hamana et al (2020), which adopt the
same HSC-Y1 shape catalog, and find that all the $S_8$ constraints are
consistent with each other, although expected correlations between derived
$S_8$ constraints are weak.

Title:Can one-zone hadronuclear model explain the hard-TeV spectrum of BL Lac objects?,"
Abstract:  Context. The intrinsic TeV emission of some BL Lacs are characterized by a
hard spectrum (the hard-TeV spectrum) after correcting for the extragalactic
background light. The hard-TeV spectra pose a challenge to conventional
one-zone models, including the leptonic model, the photohadronic model, the
proton synchrotron model, etc.
Aims. In this work, we study if the one-zone hadronuclear (pp) model can be
used to interpret the hard-TeV spectra of BL Lacs without introducing extreme
parameters.
Methods. We give analytical calculations to study if there is a parameter
space and the charge neutrality condition of jet can be satisfied when
interpreting the hard-TeV spectra of BL Lacs without introducing a
super-Eddington jet power.
Results. We find that in a sample of hard-TeV BL Lacs collected by Xue et al.
(2019a), only the hard-TeV spectrum of 1ES 0229+200 could be explained by
gamma-ray from pi-0 decay produced in the pp interactions, but at the cost of
setting a small radius of the radiation region that comparable to the
Schwarzschild radius of the central black hole. Combining with previous studies
of other one-zone models, we suggest that the hard-TeV spectra of BL Lacs
cannot be explained by any one-zone models without introducing extreme
parameters, and should originate from the multiple radiation regions.

Title:Gravitational wave signals in the deci-Hz range from neutrinos during the proto-neutron star cooling phase,"
Abstract:  We investigate the gravitational waves (GWs) at low frequencies produced by
neutrinos that are emitted anisotropically from the proto-neutron star (PNS)
during its cooling phase that lasts about a minute. We first give a formulation
based on the spherical-harmonic expansion of the neutrino luminosity to obtain
the gravitational waveform as well as the characteristic strain. In the absence
of multi-dimensional simulations of PNS cooling, from which we can extract
reliable data on the neutrino luminosities as a function of solid angle, we
construct them by hand. In the first model, the time evolution is approximated
by piece-wise exponential functions (PEFs); in the second model we employ the
time evolution obtained in a 1D cooling simulation for all harmonic components
for simplicity; In both cases, we consider not only axisymmetric components but
also non-axisymmetric ones; for the latter, in particular, we consider as the
third model axisymetric neutrino emissions that are misaligned with the
rotation axis and, as a result, rotate with the PNS. We find from the first
model that the decay times in PEF at late phases can be inferred from the
positions of bumps and dips in the characteristic strain of the GW in the case
of a slow cooling, whereas it may be obtained by identifying the positions of
slope change in the case of rapid cooling, which may be induced by convections
in PNS. We also find from the first model that the rotation of PNS can be
reflected in GW waveforms. Finally, we compared the characteristic strains with
sensitivity curves GW detectors, finding that above phenomena are expected to
be detected by DECIGO if the PNS is located at 10kpc.

also has a velocity gradient of ~0.16 km s^-1 20""^-1. A velocity shift by up to
3 km s^-1 from the systemic velocity at ~49 km s^-1 is detected at only the
northwestern part of N4. The volume density of the molecular hydrogen gas and
the kinematic temperature are estimated at eight local peaks of 12CO(J=1-0) and
13CO(J=3-2) emissions by the RADEX code. The calculated n(H2) is an order of
10^3 cm^-3, and T_k ranges ~20 K to ~56 K. The mass of N4 is estimated to be
~7300 Mo. The thermal and turbulent pressures in N4 are estimated to be ~10^5 K
cm^-3 and ~10^7 K cm^-3, respectively. The relation of the thermal and
turbulent pressures in N4 tends to be similar to that of the molecular clouds
in the Galactic plane. However, these values are higher than those in the
typical molecular clouds in the Galactic plane. Several pieces of
circumstantial evidence representing the physical properties of N4 and
comparison with the data of infrared and X-ray radiation suggest that N4 is
interacting with a jet from SS433. However, no gamma-ray radiation is detected
toward N4. Compared to the previous study, it is hard to detect the gamma-ray
radiation by cosmic-ray proton origin due to the low sensitivity of the current
gamma-ray observatories. Any OH emission was not detected toward N4 due to the
low sensitivity of the observation and antenna beam dilution.

Title:NEID Rossiter-McLaughlin Measurement of TOI-1268b: A Young Warm Saturn Aligned with Its Cool Host Star,"
Abstract:  Close-in gas giants present a surprising range of stellar obliquity, the
angle between a planet's orbital axis and its host star's spin axis. It is
unclear whether the obliquities reflect the planets' dynamical history (e.g.,
aligned for in situ formation or disk migration versus misaligned for
high-eccentricity tidal migration) or whether other mechanisms (e.g.,
primordial misalignment or planet-star interactions) are more important in
sculpting the obliquity distribution. Here we present the stellar obliquity
measurement of TOI-1268 (TIC-142394656, $V_{\rm mag} {\sim} 10.9$), a young
K-type dwarf hosting an 8.2-day period, Saturn-sized planet. TOI-1268's lithium
abundance and rotation period suggest the system age between the ages of
Pleiades cluster (${\sim}120$ Myr) and Praesepe cluster (${\sim}670$ Myr).
Using the newly commissioned NEID spectrograph, we constrain the stellar
obliquity of TOI-1268 via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect from both radial
velocity (RV) and Doppler Tomography (DT) signals. The 3$\sigma$ upper bounds
of the projected stellar obliquity $|\lambda|$ from both models are below
60$^\circ$. The large host star separation ($a/R_\star {\sim} 17$), combined
with the system's young age, makes it unlikely that the planet has realigned
its host star. The stellar obliquity measurement of TOI-1268 probes the
architecture of a young gas giant beyond the reach of tidal realignment
($a/R_\star {\gtrsim} 10$) and reveals an aligned or slightly misaligned
system.

universal gravitational interaction. We focus here on two main features of the
effective dark matter in NLG, namely, (a) the density of effective dark matter
in NLG is always finite and therefore cusp-free, and (b) there is less
effective dark matter in dwarf galaxies than is generally assumed in the
standard particle dark matter paradigm. The corresponding astrophysical
implications of NLG in connection with three ultra-diffuse galaxies AGC 114905,
242019, and 219533 are discussed.

Title:Low redshift constraints on scale-covariant models,"
Abstract:  The search for a physical model which explains the observed recent
acceleration of the universe is a compelling task of modern fundamental
cosmology. Recently Fernandes \textit{et al.} presented low redshift
observational constraints on a scale invariant model by Maeder.
Phenomenologically this can be interpreted as a bimetric theory with a
time-dependent cosmological constant. It was shown that a matter density
$\Omega_m\sim0.3$ is a poor fit to the data, and the best-fit model would
require a fluid with a much smaller density and a significantly positive
equation of state parameter. This model is a particular case of an earlier and
broader class of models by Canuto \textit{et al.}, which we study here.
Specifically, we consider it in two distinct scenarios: as a genuine
alternative to $\Lambda$CDM (i.e., without any cosmological constant) and as a
parametric extension thereof (where both a cosmological constant and the new
mechanism can coexist, and the relative contributions of both are determined by
the data). We find that the first scenario can in principle fit the
low-redshift data (but a good fit would require values of model parameters,
such as the matter equation of state, in conflict with other data), while in
the second one the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM is constrained to be small.

Title:Prospects for the detection of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background with the experiments SK-Gd and JUNO,"
Abstract:  The advent of gadolinium-loaded Super-Kamiokande (SK-Gd) and of the
soon-to-start JUNO liquid scintillator detector marks a substantial improvement
in the global sensitivity for the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB).
The present article reviews the detector properties most relevant for the DSNB
searches in both experiments and estimates the expected signal and background
levels. Based on these inputs, we evaluate the sensitivity of both experiments
individually and combined. Using a simplified statistical approach, we find
that both SK-Gd and JUNO have the potential to reach $>$3$\sigma$ evidence of
the DSNB signal within 10 years of measurement. The combined results are likely
to enable a $5\sigma$ discovery of the DSNB signal within the next decade.

"Title:Sub-kilometre scale ionospheric studies at the SKA-Low site, using MWA extended baselines","
Abstract:  The ambitious scientific goals of SKA require a matching capability for
calibration of instrumental and atmospheric propagation contributions as
functions of time, frequency and position. The development of novel calibration
algorithms to meet these requirements is an active field of research. In this
work {we aim to characterize} these, focusing on the spatial and temporal
structure scales of the ionospheric effects; ultimately, these provide the
guidelines for designing the optimum calibration strategy. We used empirical
ionospheric measurements at the site where the SKA-Low will be built, using MWA
Phase-2 Extended baseline observations and the station-based Low-frequency
Excision of Atmosphere in Parallel (LEAP) calibration algorithm. We have done
this via direct regression analysis of the ionospheric screens and by forming
the full and detrended structure functions. We found that 50% of the screens
show significant non-linear structures at scales >0.6km that dominate at >2km,
and 1% show significant sub-minute temporal changes, providing that there is
sufficient sensitivity. Even at the moderate sensitivity and baseline lengths
of MWA, non-linear corrections are required at 88 MHz during moderate-weather
and at 154 MHz during poor weather, or for high SNR measurements. Therefore we
predict that improvements will come from correcting for higher-order defocusing
effects in observations with MWA Phase-2, and further with new developments in
MWA Phase-3. Because of the giant leap in sensitivity, the correction for
complex ionospheric structures will be mandatory on SKA-Low, for both imaging
and tied-array beam formation.

Title:Magnetar XTE J1810-197: Spectro-temporal evolution of average radio emission,"
Abstract:  We present the long-term spectro-temporal evolution of the average radio
emission properties of the magnetar XTE J1810-197 (PSR J1809-1943) following
its most recent outburst in late 2018. We report the results from two and a
half years of monitoring campaign with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope carried out over the frequency range of 300 - 1450 MHz. Our
observations show intriguing time variability in the average profile width,
flux density, spectral index and the broadband spectral shape. While the
average profile width appears to gradually decrease at later epochs, the flux
density shows multiple episodes of radio re-brightening over the course of our
monitoring. Our systematic monitoring observations reveal that the radio
spectrum has steepened over time, resulting in evolution from a magnetar-like
to a more pulsar-like spectrum. A more detailed analysis reveals that the radio
spectrum has a turnover, and this turnover shifts towards lower frequencies
with time. We present the details of our analysis leading to these results, and
discuss our findings in the context of magnetar radio emission mechanisms as
well as potential manifestations of the intervening medium. We also briefly
discuss whether an evolving spectral turnover could be an ubiquitous property
of radio magnetars.

"Title:Cosmicflows-4: The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation Providing ~10,000 Distances","
Abstract:  The interstellar gas in spiral galaxies can constitute a significant fraction
of the baryon mass and it has been demonstrated that the sum of stellar and gas
components correlates well with the kinematic signature of the total mass
content, the widths of HI line profiles. The correlation of baryonic mass with
HI line widths is used here to obtain distances for 9984 galaxies extending to
~0.05c. The sample is HI flux limited and a correction is required to account
for an HI selection bias. The absolute scale is established by 64 galaxies with
known distances from studies of Cepheid variables and/or the magnitudes of
stars at the tip of the red giant branch. The calibration of the baryonic
relationship results in a determination of the Hubble constant of H_0=75.5+-2.5
km/s/Mpc. The error estimate is statistical. This material will be combined
with contributions from other methodologies in a subsequent article where
systematic uncertainties will be investigated.

Title:GRB Prompt Emission with Anisotropic Electron Distribution,"
Abstract:  The typical spectrum of the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
indicates that the electron cooling is suppressed in spite of the strong
magnetic field in the standard synchrotron model. Recent Particle-in-Cell
simulations show that the particle acceleration by magnetic reconnection in a
magnetically dominated plasma can lead to small pitch angles especially in
low-energy region. Such a small pitch angle prevents electrons from cooling via
synchrotron radiation. In this paper, taking into account the effects of the
synchrotron cooling and the adiabatic cooling, we numerically calculate the
synchrotron spectra with anisotropic electron distributions. If we require a
Poynting flux larger than $10^{50}~\mbox{erg}~\mbox{s}^{-1}$ as the model is
motivated by magnetic reconnection, the bulk Lorentz factor of $\sim 1000$ and
the electron minimum Lorentz factor of $\gamma_{\rm min}\sim 10^4$ are required
to reproduce the typical GRB spectrum.

Title:System equivalent flux density of a low-frequency polarimetric phased array interferometer,"
Abstract:  This paper extends the treatment of system equivalent flux density (SEFD) in
Sutinjo, A. T. et al. (2021) (Paper I) to interferometric phased array
telescopes. The objective is to develop an SEFD formula involving only the most
fundamental assumptions and one that is readily applicable to phased array
interferometer radio observations. Then, we aimed at comparing the resultant
SEFD expression against the often-used root-mean-square (RMS) SEFD
approximation, SEFDrmsI = (1/2)(SEFD^2_XX + SEFD^2_YY)^(1/2) to study the
inaccuracy of the SEFDrms.
We take into account all mutual coupling and noise coupling within an array
environment (intra-array coupling). This intra-array noise coupling is included
in the SEFD expression through the realized noise resistance of the array,
which accounts for the system noise. No assumption is made regarding the
polarization (or lack thereof) of the sky nor the orthogonality of the antenna
elements. The fundamental noise assumption is that, in phasor representation,
the real and imaginary components of a given noise source are independent and
equally distributed (iid) with zero mean. Noise sources that are mutually
correlated and non-iid among themselves are allowed, provided the real and
imaginary components of each noise source are iid. The system noise is
uncorrelated between array entities separated by a baseline distance, which in
the case of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is typically tens of
wavelengths or greater. By comparing the resulting SEFD formula to the
SEFD_I^rms approximation, we proved that SEFD_I^rms always underestimates the
SEFD, which leads to an overestimation of array sensitivity.

Title:Effect of Magnetic Field Dissipation on Primordial Li Abundance,"
Abstract:  The dissipation effects of primordial magnetic fields on the primordial
elemental abundances were investigated. When a magnetic field reconnects, its
energy is converted to the kinetic energy of charged particles, as observed for
solar energetic particles arriving on earth. This accelerates the cosmic
background nuclei, and energetic nuclei induce nonthermal reactions. A
constraint on the dissipation is derived from a theoretical calculation of the
nonthermal reactions during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We found that
observations of the Li and D abundances can be explained if 0.01--0.1 % of the
cosmic energy density was utilized for nuclear acceleration after the
electron--positron annihilation epoch. Reconnections of such amplitudes of
magnetic fields generate outgoing jets, the bulk velocity of which evolves to
values appropriate for cosmic ray (CR) nuclear energies of 0.1--1 MeV necessary
for successful CR nucleosynthesis. Therefore, acceleration of cosmic background
nuclei during the dissipation of primordial magnetic fields is a possible
generation mechanism of soft CRs that has been suggested as a solution to the
cosmic Li problem. Among the solutions suggested without exotic physics, only
the dissipating magnetic field model suggested here explains observations of
both low Li and high D abundances. Our results demonstrate that signatures of
strong magnetic fields in the early universe have been observed in primordial
elemental abundances.

Title:A Simple Radial Gradient Filter for Batch-Processing of Coronagraph Images,"
Abstract:  Images of the extended solar corona, as observed by white-light coronagraphs
as observed by different white-light coronagraphs include the K- and F-corona
and suffer from a radial variation in intensity. These images require
separation of the two coronal components with some additional image-processing
to reduce the intensity gradient and analyse the structures and processes
occurring at different heights in the solar corona within the full field of
view. To process these bulk coronagraph images with steep radial-intensity
gradients, we have developed an algorithm: Simple Radial Gradient Filter
(SiRGraF). This algorithm is based on subtracting a minimum background
(F-corona) created using long-duration images and then dividing the resultant
by a uniform intensity gradient image to enhance the K-corona. We demonstrate
the utility of this algorithm to bring out the short time-scale transient
structures of the corona. SiRGraF could be used to reveal and analyse such
structures. It is not suitable for quantitative estimations based on intensity.
We have successfully tested the algorithm on images of the LASCO-C2 onboard the
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and COR-2A onboard the STEREO with
good signal to noise ratio (SNR) along with low-SNR images of STEREO/COR-1A and
the KCoronagraph. We also compared the performance of SiRGraF with Normalising
Radial Gradient Filter (NRGF). We found that when hundreds of images have to be
processed, SiRGraF works faster than NRGF, providing similar brightness and
contrast in the images and separating the transient features. Moreover, SiRGraF
works better on low-SNR images of COR-1A than NRGF, providing better
identification of dynamic coronal structures throughout the field of view. We
discuss the advantages and limitations of the algorithm.

Title:Time variations in the UV background,"
Abstract:  We have found variations in the diffuse ultraviolet background on the scale
about 10 days over the 10 year life of the GALEX mission. These variations are
only apparent in the near-ultraviolet band of GALEX and are most likely related
to variations in the zodiacal light due to brightness variations of the solar
NUV flux. The variations can be as high as 200 photon units in the NUV,
amounting to about 15 % of the zodiacal light or < 10 % of the total NUV
diffuse radiation. There is no effect on the far-ultraviolet band of GALEX.
Further work will require better observations chosen specifically for the
purpose of investigating this component and will be difficult to obtain.

Title:Searching for mass-spin correlations in the population of gravitational-wave events: the GWTC-3 case study,"
Abstract:  One fundamental goal of the newly born gravitational wave astronomy is
discovering the origin of the observed binary black hole mergers. Towards this
end, identifying features in the growing wealth of data may help in
distinguishing different formation pathways. While large uncertainties still
affect the binary formation models, spin-mass relations remain characteristic
features of specific classes of channels. By focusing on the effective inspiral
spin $\chi_\text{eff}$, the best reconstructed spin-related merger parameter,
we show that current GWTC-3 data support the hypothesis that a fraction of
events may display mass-spin correlations similar to one expected by dynamical
formation channels of either astrophysical or primordial nature. We quantify
the Bayesian evidence in favour of those models, which are substantially
preferred when compared to the Gaussian phenomenological model adopted to
describe the distribution of $\chi_\text{eff}$ in the recent LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA
population analyses.

Title:A population of transition disks around evolved stars: Fingerprints of planets? Catalog of disks surrounding Galactic post-AGB binaries,"
Abstract:  Post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binaries are surrounded by massive
disks of gas and dust that are similar to protoplanetary disks around young
stars. We assembled a catalog of all known Galactic post-AGB binaries with
disks. We explore the correlations between the different observables with the
aim of learning more about potential disk-binary interactions. We compiled
spectral energy distributions of 85 Galactic post-AGB binary systems. We built
a color-color diagram to differentiate between the different disk morphologies
traced by the infrared excess. We categorized the different disk types and
searched for correlations with other observational characteristics of these
systems. Between 8 and 12% of our targets are surrounded by transition disks,
that is, disks having no or low near-infrared excess. We find a strong link
between these transition disks and the depletion of refractory elements on the
surface of the post-AGB star. We interpret this link as evidence of a mechanism
that stimulates the dust and gas separation within the disk and that also
produces the transition disk structure. We propose that such a mechanism is
likely to be due to a giant planet carving a hole in the disk, effectively
trapping the dust in the outer disk parts. We propose disk evolutionary
scenarios, depending on the presence of such a giant planet in the disk. We
advocate that giant planets can successfully explain the link between the
transition disks and the observed depletion of refractory materials. If the
planetary scenario is confirmed, disks around post-AGB binaries could be a
unique laboratory for testing planet-disk interactions and their influence on
the late evolution of binary stars. The question of whether such planets are
first- or second-generation bodies remains to be considered. We argue that
these disks are ideal for studying planet formation in unprecedented parameter
space.

Title:A Minimal Model for Massive Neutrinos in Newtonian N-body Simulations,"
Abstract:  We present a novel method for including the impact of massive neutrinos in
cold dark matter N-body simulations. Our approach is compatible with widely
employed Newtonian N-body codes and relies on only three simple modifications.
First, we use commonly employed backscaling initial conditions, based on the
cold dark matter plus baryon power spectrum instead of the total matter power
spectrum. Second, the accurate Hubble rate is employed in both the backscaling
and the evolution of particles in the N-body code. Finally, we shift the final
particle positions in a post-processing step to account for the integrated
effect of neutrinos on the particles in the simulation. However, we show that
the first two modifications already capture most of the relevant neutrino
physics for a large range of observationally interesting redshifts and scales.
The output of the simulations are the cold dark matter and baryon distributions
and can be analysed using standard methods. All modifications are simple to
implement and do not generate any computational overhead. By implementing our
methods in the N-body codes GADGET and gevolution, we show that any
state-of-the-art Newtonian N-body code can be utilised out of the box. Our
method is also compatible with higher order Lagrangian perturbation theory
initial conditions and accurate for combined neutrino masses of up to at least
0.3 eV. Being formulated in relativistic gauge theory, in addition to including
the impact of massive neutrinos, our method further includes relativistic
corrections relevant on the large scales for free.

Title:Size and albedo of the largest detected Oort-cloud object: comet C/2014 UN 271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein),"
Abstract:  The recently announced Oort-cloud comet C/2014 UN271
(Bernardinelli-Bernstein) is remarkable in at least three respects: (i) it was
discovered inbound as far as ~29 au from the Sun (with prediscovery images up
to ~34 au); (ii) it showed cometary activity already at almost 24 au; and (iii)
its nuclear magnitude (Hr ~ 8.0) indicates an exceptionally large object.
Detection of gases is expected in the upcoming years as the comet is heading
towards a ~11 au perihelion in 2031. We used ALMA in extended configuration
(resolution ~0.064"") to measure the 1287 um (233 GHz) continuum flux of the
comet. Observations were performed on August 8, 2021 at a 20.0 au distance from
the Sun. The high spatial resolution was chosen in order to filter out any dust
contribution. We detected the thermal emission of the object at ~10 sigma, with
a flux of 0.128+/-0.012 mJy. Based on observational constraints and our
theoretical estimates of the dust contribution, the entirety of the measured
flux can be attributed to the nucleus. From NEATM modelling combined with the
Hr magnitude, we determine a surface-equivalent diameter of 137+/-17 km and a
red geometric albedo of 5.3+/-1.2 %. This confirms that 2014 UN271 is by far
the largest Oort-cloud object ever found (almost twice as large as comet C/1995
O1 Hale-Bopp), and except for the Centaur 95P/Chiron which shows outburst-like
activity, the largest known comet in the Solar System. On the other hand, the
object albedo is typical of comets, adding credence for a ""universal"" comet
nucleus albedo. With its distant perihelion and uniquely large size, 2014 UN271
is the prominent archetype of distant comets, whose activity is driven by
hypervolatiles. Post-perihelion thermal measurements will permit to study
possible albedo changes, such as a surface brightening compared to
pre-perihelion, as was observed for Hale-Bopp.

Abstract:  We estimate the parameters of the donor of the accreting black-hole binary
MAXI J1820+070. The measured values of the binary period, rotational and radial
velocities and constraints on the orbital inclination imply the donor is a
subgiant with the mass of $M_2\approx 0.49^{+0.10}_{-0.10}M_\odot$ and the
radius of $R_2\approx 1.19^{+0.08}_{-0.08}R_\odot$. We re-analyze the
previously obtained optical spectrum from the Gran Telescopio Canarias, and
found it yields a strict lower limit on the effective temperature of $T>4200$
K. We compile optical and infrared fluxes observed during the quiescence of
this system. From the minima $r$ and $i$-band fluxes found in Pan-STARSS1 Data
Release 2 pre-discovery imaging and for a distance of $D\approx3$ kpc,
reddening of $E(B$--$V)=0.23$ and $R_2\approx{1.11R_\odot}$, we find
$T\lesssim4230$ K, very close to the above lower limit. For a larger distance,
the temperature can be higher, up to about 4500 K (corresponding to a K5
spectral type, preferred by previous studies) at $D=3.5$ kpc, allowed by the
Gaia parallax. We perform evolutionary calculations for the binary system and
compare them to the observational constraints. Our model fitting the above
temperature and radius constraints at $D\approx 3$ kpc has the mass of
$0.4M_\odot$, $T\approx4200$ K and solar metallicity. Two alternative models
require $D\gtrsim 3.3$--3.4 kpc at $0.4 M_\odot$, $T\approx4500$ K and half
solar metallicity, and $0.5M_\odot$, $T\approx4300$ K and solar metallicity.
These models yield mass transfer rates of $\sim\!\!10^{-10}M_\odot$/yr,
compatible with those based on the estimated accreted mass of $\approx\!2\times
10^{25}$ g and the time between the 2018 discovery and the 1934 historical
outburst.

Title:Powering Stellar Magnetism: Energy Transfers in Cyclic Dynamos of Sun-like Stars,"
Abstract:  We use the ASH code to model the convective dynamo of solar-type stars. Based
on a series of 15 3-D MHD simulations spanning 4 bins in rotation and mass, we
show what mechanisms are at work in these stellar dynamos with and without
magnetic cycles and how global stellar parameters affect the outcome. We also
derive scaling laws for the differential rotation and magnetic field based on
these simulations. We find a weaker trend between differential rotation and
stellar rotation rate, ($\Delta \Omega \sim (|\Omega|/\Omega_{\odot})^{0.46}$)
in the MHD solutions than in their HD counterpart
$(|\Omega|/\Omega_{\odot})^{0.66})$, yielding a better agreement with the
observational trends based on power laws. We find that for a fluid Rossby
number between $0.15 \lesssim Ro_f \lesssim 0.65$ the solutions possess long
magnetic cycle, if $Ro_f \lesssim 0.42$ a short cycle and if $Ro_f \gtrsim 1$
(anti-solar-like differential rotation) a statistically steady state. We show
that short-cycle dynamos follow the classical Parker-Yoshimura rule whereas the
long-cycle period ones do not. We further demonstrate that the Rossby number
dependency of the large-scale surface magnetic field in the simulation
($B_{L,surf} \sim Ro_{f}^{-1.26}$) agrees better with observations ($B_{V} \sim
Ro_{s}^{-1.4 \pm 0.1}$) and differs from dynamo scaling based on the global
magnetic energy ($B_{bulk} \sim Ro_{f}^{-0.5}$). We also show that up to few
percents of the stellar luminosity can be channelled into the star's magnetism,
hence providing a large energy reservoir for possible surface eruptive events.

Aims. In order to study the physics of the accretion process in greater detail,

The orbital parameters were disentangled and a fit of the separated component

the component stars. We compared the results to models of the evolution of
interacting binaries. Results. We found that in addition to the dominant role
of the donor star and a weak contribution of the gainer, the line profiles are
strongly influenced by the circumstellar matter. The absorption lines reveal a
presence of a disk wind emanating above the orbital plane. The variability of
H{\alpha} emission yields evidence of changes in the structure of the

high-magnification microlensing event MOA-2011-BLG-191/OGLE-2011-BLG-0462

Galactic bulge. HST imaging, conducted at eight epochs over an interval of six
years, reveals a clear relativistic astrometric deflection of the background
star's apparent position. Ground-based photometry of MOA-11-191/OGLE-11-462
shows a parallactic signature of the effect of the Earth's motion on the
microlensing light curve. Combining the HST astrometry with the ground-based
light curve and the derived parallax, we obtain a lens mass of 7.1 +/- 1.3 Msun
and a distance of 1.58 +/- 0.18 kpc. We show that the lens emits no detectable
light, which, along with having a mass higher than is possible for a white
dwarf or neutron star, confirms its BH nature. Our analysis also provides an
absolute proper motion for the BH. The proper motion is offset from the mean
motion of Galactic-disk stars at similar distances by an amount corresponding
to a transverse space velocity of ~45 km/s, suggesting that the BH received a
'natal kick' from its supernova explosion. Previous mass determinations for
stellar-mass BHs have come from radial-velocity measurements of Galactic X-ray
binaries, and from gravitational radiation emitted by merging BHs in binary
systems in external galaxies. Our mass measurement is the first for an isolated

orbital period of $P\,=\,8.1577080\pm0.0000044$ days, and transits an early K
dwarf star with a mass of $M_\star$ = $ 0.96 \pm 0.04$ $M_{\odot}$, a radius of
$R_\star$ = $ 0.92 \pm 0.06$ $R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of
$T_\mathrm{eff}\,=\,5300\pm100$ K, and a metallicity of $0.36\pm0.06$ dex. By
combining TESS photometry with high-resolution spectra acquired with the Tull
spectrograph at McDonald observatory, and the high-resolution spectrographs at
Tautenburg and Ondrejov observatories, we measured a planetary mass of
$M_\mathrm{p}\,=\,96.4 \pm 8.3\,M_{\oplus}$ and a radius of
$R_\mathrm{p}\,=\,9.1 \pm 0.6\,R_{\oplus}$. TOI-1268 is an ideal system to
study the role of star-planet tidal interactions for non-inflated Saturn-mass
planets. We used system parameters derived in this paper to constrain the
planet tidal quality factor to the range of $10^{4.5-5.3}$. When compared with
the sample of other non-inflated Saturn-mass planets, TOI-1268b is one of the
best candidates for transmission spectroscopy studies.

Title:Magnitude-squared coherence: A powerful tool for disentangling Doppler planet discoveries from stellar activity,"
Abstract:  If Doppler searches for earth-mass, habitable planets are to succeed,
observers must be able to identify and model out stellar activity signals. Here
we demonstrate how to diagnose activity signals by calculating the
magnitude-squared coherence $\hat{C}^2_{xy}(f)$ between an activity indicator
time series $x_t$ and the radial velocity (RV) time series $y_t$. Since planets
only cause modulation in RV, not in activity indicators, a high value of
$\hat{C}^2_{xy}(f)$ indicates that the signal at frequency $f$ has a stellar
origin. We use Welch's method to measure coherence between activity indicators
and RVs in archival observations of GJ 581, alpha Cen B, and GJ 3998. High
RV-H$\alpha$ coherence at the frequency of GJ 3998 b, and high RV-S index
coherence at the frequency of GJ 3998 c, indicate that the planets may actually
be stellar signals. We also replicate previous results showing that GJ 581 d
and g are rotation harmonics and demonstrate that alpha Cen B has activity
signals that are not associated with rotation. Welch's power spectrum estimates
have cleaner spectral windows than Lomb-Scargle periodograms, improving our
ability to estimate rotation periods. We find that the rotation period of GJ
581 is 132 days, with no evidence of differential rotation. Welch's method may
yield unacceptably large bias for datasets with $N < 75$ observations and works
best on datasets with $N > 100$. Tapering the time-domain data can reduce the
bias of the Welch's power spectrum estimator, but observers should not apply
tapers to datasets with extremely uneven observing cadence. A software package
for calculating magnitude-squared coherence and Welch's power spectrum
estimates is available on github.

Title:Peaks and primordial black holes: the effect of non-Gaussianity,"
Abstract:  In light of recent developments in the field, we re-evaluate the effect of
local-type non-Gaussianity on the primordial black hole (PBH) abundance (and
consequently, upon constraints on the primordial power spectrum arising from
PBHs). We apply peaks theory to the full, non-linear compaction, finding that,
whilst the effect of non-Gaussianity is qualitatively similar to previous
findings, the effect is much less significant. It is found the non-Gaussianity
parameters $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{local}$ and $g_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{local}$
typically need to be approximately 1 or 2 orders of magntiude larger
respectively to have a similar to that previously found. The effect will be to
weaken the dependance of PBH constraints on the primordial power spectrum on
the non-Gaussianity parameters, as well as to dramatically weaken constraints
on the non-Gaussianity parameters (and/or PBH abundance) arising from the
non-observation of dark matter isocurvature modes. We also consider the
correlation between the curvature perturbation $\zeta$ and the compaction $C$,
finding that, whilst PBHs may form at rare peaks in $C$ these do not
necessarily correspond to rare peaks in $\zeta$ - casting some doubt on many of
the existing calculations of the PBH abundance.

Title:Frequency-Dependent Constraints on Cosmic Birefringence from the LFI and HFI Planck Data Release 4,"
Abstract:  We present new constraints on the frequency dependence of the cosmic
birefringence angle from the Planck data release 4 polarization maps. An axion
field coupled to electromagnetism predicts a nearly frequency-independent
birefringence angle, $\beta_\nu = \beta$, while Faraday rotation from local
magnetic fields and Lorentz violating theories predict a cosmic birefringence
angle that is proportional to the frequency, $\nu$, to the power of some
integer $n$, $\beta_\nu \propto \nu^n$. In this work, we first sample
$\beta_\nu$ individually for each polarized HFI frequency band in addition to
the 70 GHz channel from the LFI. We also constrain a power-law formula for the
birefringence angle, $\beta_\nu=\beta_0(\nu/\nu_0)^n$, with $\nu_0 = 150$ GHz.
For a nearly full-sky measurement, $f_{\text{sky}}=0.93$, we find $\beta_0 =
0.26^{\circ}\pm0.11^\circ$ $(68\% \text{ C.L.})$ and $n=-0.45^{+0.61}_{-0.82}$
when we ignore the intrinsic $EB$ correlations of the polarized foreground
emission, and $\beta_0 = 0.33^\circ \pm 0.12^\circ$ and
$n=-0.37^{+0.49}_{-0.64}$ when we use a filamentary dust model for the
foreground $EB$. Next, we use all the polarized Planck maps, including the 30
and 44 GHz frequency bands. These bands have a negligible foreground
contribution from polarized dust emission. We, therefore, treat them
separately. Without any modeling of the intrinsic $EB$ of the foreground, we
generally find that the inclusion of the 30 and 44 GHz frequency bands raises
the measured values of $\beta_\nu$ and tightens $n$. At nearly full-sky, we
measure $\beta_0=0.29^{\circ+0.10^\circ}_{\phantom{\circ}-0.11^\circ}$ and
$n=-0.35^{+0.48}_{-0.47}$. Assuming no frequency dependence, we measure
$\beta=0.33^\circ \pm 0.10^\circ$. If our measurements have effectively
mitigated the $EB$ of the foreground, our constraints are consistent with a
mostly frequency-independent signal of cosmic birefringence.

Title:The Atmospheric Response to High Nonthermal Electron Beam Fluxes in Solar Flares. II. Hydrogen Broadening Predictions for Solar Flare Observations with the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope,"
Abstract:  Red-shifted components of chromospheric emission lines in the hard X-ray
impulsive phase of solar flares have recently been studied through their 30 s
evolution with the high resolution of IRIS. Radiative-hydrodynamic flare models
show that these redshifts are generally reproduced by electron-beam generated
chromospheric condensations. The models produce large ambient electron
densities, and the pressure broadening of hydrogen Balmer series should be
readily detected in observations. To accurately interpret upcoming spectral
data of flares with the DKIST, we incorporate non-ideal, non-adiabatic line
broadening profiles of hydrogen into the RADYN code. These improvements allow
time-dependent predictions for the extreme Balmer line wing enhancements in
solar flares. We study two chromospheric condensation models, which cover a
range of electron beam fluxes ($1-5 \times 10^{11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$) and
ambient electron densities ($1 - 60 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$) in the flare
chromosphere. Both models produce broadening and redshift variations within 10
s of the onset of beam heating. In the chromospheric condensations, there is
enhanced spectral broadening due to large optical depths at H$\alpha$,
H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$, while the much lower optical depth of the Balmer
series H12$-$H16 provides a translucent window into the smaller electron
densities in the beam-heated layers below the condensation. The wavelength
ranges of typical DKIST/ViSP spectra of solar flares will be sufficient to test
the predictions of extreme hydrogen wing broadening and accurately constrain
large densities in chromospheric condensations.

Title:Barium stars as tracers of s-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars I. 28 stars with independently derived AGB mass,"
Abstract:  Barium (Ba) stars are polluted by material enriched in the slow neutron
capture (s-process) elements synthesised in the interior of their former
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companion star, which is now a white dwarf. We
compare individual Ba star abundance patterns to AGB nucleosynthesis models to
verify if the AGB model mass is compatible with independently derived AGB mass.
We selected a sample of 28 Ba stars for which both self-consistent
spectroscopic observation and analysis are available and stellar mass
determinations, via positioning the star on the HR diagram and comparing with
evolutionary tracks. For this sample stars we considered both previously and
recently derived elemental abundances. Then, we performed a detailed comparison
of these s-process elemental abundances to different AGB nucleosynthesis models
from the Monash and the FRUITY theoretical data sets. We simplified the binary
mass transfer by calculating dilution factors to match the [Ce/Fe] value of
each star when using different AGB models, and we then compared the diluted
model abundances to the complete Ba-star abundance pattern. Our comparison
confirms that low mass, non-rotating AGB stellar models with 13C as the main
neutron source are the polluters of the vast majority of the considered Ba
stars. Out of the 28 stars, in 21 cases the models are in good agreement with
both the determined abundances and the independently derived AGB mass, although
in 16 cases higher observed abundances of Nb, Ru, Mo and/or Nd, Sm than
predicted. For 3 stars we obtain a match to the abundances only by considering
models with masses lower than those independently determined. Finally, 4 stars
show much higher first s-process peak abundance values than the model
predictions, which may represent the signature of a physical and/or
nucleosynthetic process that is not represented in the set of models considered
here.

Title:$H_0$ as a Universal FLRW Diagnostic,"
Abstract:  We reverse the logic behind the apparent existence of $H_0$-tension, to
design diagnostics for cosmological models. The basic idea is that the
non-constancy of $H_0$ inferred from observations at different redshifts is a
null hypothesis test for models within the FLRW paradigm -- if $H_0$ runs, the
model is wrong. Depending on the kind of observational data, the most suitable
form of the diagnostic can vary. As examples, we present two $H_0$ diagnostics
that are adapted to two different BAO observables. We use these and the
corresponding BAO data to Gaussian reconstruct the running of $H_0$ in flat
$\Lambda$CDM with Planck values for the model parameters. For flat $\Lambda$CDM
when the radiation contribution can be neglected, with comoving distance data,
the diagnostic is a simple hypergeometric function. Possible late time
deviations from the FLRW paradigm can also be accommodated, by simply keeping
track of the (potentially anisotropic) sky variation of the diagnostic.

Title:Tracking the origin of black holes with the stochastic gravitational wave background popcorn signal,"
Abstract:  Unresolved sources of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by the merger of a
binary of black holes at cosmological distances combine into a stochastic
background. Such a background is in the continuous or popcorn regime, depending
on whether the GW rate is high enough so that two or more events overlap in the
same frequency band. These two regimes respectively correspond to large and
small values of the so-called {\it duty cycle}. We study the detection regime
of the background in models of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and compare it to
the one produced by black holes of stellar origin. Focusing on ground-based
detectors, we show that the duty cycle of the PBH-origin background is larger
than that of astrophysical black holes because of differences in their mass
function and the merger rate. Our study opens up the possibility to learn about
the primordial or astrophysical nature of black hole populations by examining
the statistical properties of the stochastic background.

Title:EDGE: the puzzling ellipticity of Eridanus II's star cluster and its implications for dark matter at the heart of an ultra-faint dwarf,"
Abstract:  The Eridanus II (EriII) 'ultra-faint' dwarf has a large ($15\,\text{pc}$) and
low mass ($4.3\times10^3\,\text{M}_\odot$) star cluster (SC) offset from its
centre by $23\pm3\,\text{pc}$ in projection. Its size and offset are naturally
explained if EriII has a central dark matter core, but such a core may be
challenging to explain in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this paper, we revisit
the survival and evolution of EriII's SC, focussing for the first time on its
puzzlingly large ellipticity ($0.31^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$). We perform a suite of
960 direct $N$-body simulations of SCs, orbiting within a range of spherical
background potentials fit to ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy simulations. We
find only two scenarios that come close to explaining EriII's SC. In the first,
EriII has a low density dark matter core (of size $\sim70\,\text{pc}$ and
density $\lesssim2\times10^8\,\text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{kpc}^{-3}$). In this
model, the high ellipticity of EriII's SC is set at birth, with the lack of
tidal forces in the core allowing its ellipticity to remain frozen in for long
times. In the second, EriII's SC orbits in a partial core, with its high
ellipticity owing to its imminent tidal destruction. However, this latter model
struggles to reproduce the large size of EriII's SC, and it predicts
substantial tidal tails around EriII's SC that should have already been seen in
the data. This leads us to favour the cored model. We discuss potential caveats
to these findings, and the implications of the cored model for galaxy formation
and the nature of dark matter.

Title:The landscape of massive black-hole spectroscopy with LISA and Einstein Telescope,"
Abstract:  Measuring the quasi-normal mode~(QNM) spectrum emitted by a perturbed
black-hole~(BH) --~also known as BH spectroscopy~-- provides an excellent
opportunity to test the predictions of general relativity in the strong-gravity
regime. We investigate the prospects and precision of BH spectroscopy in
massive binary black hole ringdowns, one of the primary science objectives of
the future Laser Interferometric Space Antenna~(LISA) mission. We simulate
various massive binary BH population models, featuring competing prescriptions
for the Delays between galaxy and BH mergers, for the impact of supernova
feedback on massive BH growth, and for the initial population of high redshift
BH seeds (light versus heavy seeds). For each of these scenarios, we compute
the average number of expected events for precision BH spectroscopy using a
Fisher-matrix analysis. We find that, for any heavy seed scenario, LISA will
measure the dominant mode frequency within ${\cal O}(0.1) \%$ relative
uncertainty and will estimate at least 3 independent QNM parameters within $1
\%$ error. The most optimistic heavy seed scenarios produce $\mathcal{O}(100)$
events with $1 \%$ measurability for 3 or more QNM quantities during LISA's
operational time. On the other hand, light seed scenarios produce lighter
merger remnants, which ring at frequencies higher than LISA's sensitivity.
Interestingly, the light seed models give rise to a fraction of mergers in the
band of Einstein Telescope, allowing for the measurement of 3 QNM parameters
with $\sim 10 \%$ relative errors in approximately a few to ten events/yr. More
precise BH spectroscopy in the light seed scenarios would require instruments
operating in the deciHertz band.

Title:Boltzmann Meets Lorentz: A Surrogate Model for Black Hole Echoes,"
Abstract:  The existence of black hole horizons has not been strictly proven
observationally, and indeed it may not be possible to do so. However,
alternatives may be established by the observation of gravitational wave echoes
that probe possible near-horizon structure. These echoes are proposed to be
generated in exotic compact objects that are horizonless and feature a
partially reflecting ""wall"" inside their light rings, creating a cavity in
which gravitational perturbations may echo, while leaking out through the
angular momentum barrier with each pass. The characteristic signature of echoes
is a comb of nearly evenly spaced spectral resonances. While approximately
true, deviations from this simple picture can lead to severe observational
signal losses. In this paper, we explore such subtleties with the latest
results for echo sourcing and geometry. A physically motivated echo model is
then developed as a sum over Lorentzian spectral lines, parametrized by
functions of the horizon frame frequency and the size of the cavity. Our final
spectrum is a function of only the mass and spin of the black hole, as well as
the UV scale of the near-horizon physics. We then apply this model in a search
for echoes in the gravitational wave event with the loudest ringdown signal in
LIGO/Virgo, i.e. GW190521. We interpret our findings as a measurement of the
fractional energy in post-merger echoes equal to $E_{echoes} / E_{GR} = 8.9 \pm
4.5\%$, where the uncertainty range represents the 90% credible region. The
robustness of this result is tested against noise backgrounds and simulated
injections, and we find that a signal persists through modifications to the
model and changes in the data search.

Title:GW190521: First Measurement of Stimulated Hawking Radiation from Black Holes,"
Abstract:  Being the most massive binary black hole merger event observed to date,
GW190521 is in a class of its own. The exceptionally loud ringdown of this
merger makes it an ideal candidate to search for gravitational wave echoes, a
proposed smoking gun for the quantum structure of black hole horizons. We
perform an unprecedented multi-pronged search for echoes via two
well-established and independent pipelines: a template-based search for
stimulated emission of Hawking radiation, or Boltzmann echoes, and the
model-agnostic coherent WaveBurst (cWB) search. Stimulated Hawking radiation
from the merger is expected to lead to post-merger echoes at horizon mode
frequency of $\sim 50$ Hz (for quadrupolar gravitational radiation), repeating
at intervals of $\sim 1$ second, due to partial reflection off Planckian
quantum structure of the horizon. A careful analysis using dynamic nested
sampling yields a Bayesian evidence of $ 7\pm 2$ (90% confidence level) for
this signal following GW190521, carrying an excess of $10^{+9}_{-7}\%$ in
gravitational wave energy, relative to the main event. Similarly, the
reconstructed waveform of the first echo in cWB carries an energy excess of
$13^{+16}_{-7}\%$. Accounting for the ""look-elsewhere"" effects, we estimate a
p-value for false detection probability of $5.1 \times 10^{-3}$ (or
2.6$\sigma$) using cWB pipeline, although the verdict on the co-localization of
the post-merger echo and the main event in the sky is inconclusive. While the
current evidence for stimulated Hawking radiation does not reach the gold
standard of $5\sigma$, our findings are in line with expectations for
stimulated Hawking radiation at current detector sensitivities. The next
generation of gravitational wave observatories can thus draw a definitive
conclusion on the quantum nature of black hole horizons.

Abstract:  Intraplate volcanic islands are often considered as stable relief with

This study shows that large landslides cause non-negligible isostatic

Theoretical cases also reveal that a coastal motion of 1 m occurred for a

Abstract:  Cosmic ray muons have been considered as a non-conventional radiation probe
in various applications. To utilize cosmic ray muons in engineering
applications, two important quantities, trajectory and momentum, must be known.
The muon trajectories are easily reconstructed using two-fold detector arrays
with a high spatial resolution. However, precise measurement of muon momentum
is difficult to be achieved without deploying large and expensive spectrometers

measure muon momentum with a resolution of +-0.5 GeV/c in a momentum range of
0.1 to 10.0 GeV/c, but also we can reconstruct cosmic muon spectrum with high

density-functional EOS of the ""DD2"" class with excluded volume effects and a
deconfined quark matter phase modeled by an instantaneous nonlocal version of
the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in SU(2)$_f$ with vector interactions and color
superconductivity. The form factor in the nonlocal quark matter model is fitted
to lattice QCD results in the Coulomb gauge. Owing to strong coupling in the
vector meson and diquark channels, a coexistence phase of color
superconductivity and chiral symmetry breaking occurs. Our results show an
approximately constant behavior for the squared speed of sound with values of
0.4 - 0.6 in the density region relevant for neutron star interiors. To
simultaneously fulfill the constraints from the Neutron Star Interior
Composition Explorer radius measurement for PSR J0740+6620 and tidal

Abstract:  In a recent work [Bret, EPL \textbf{135} (2021) 35001], quantum
electrodynamic (QED) effects were evaluated for the two-stream instability. It
pertains to the growth of perturbations with a wave vector oriented along the
flow in a collisionless counter-streaming system. Here, the analysis is
extended to every possible orientation of the wave vector. The previous result
for the two-stream instability is recovered, and it is proved that even within
the framework of a 3D analysis, this instability remains fundamentally 1D even
when accounting for QED effects. The filamentation instability, found for wave
vectors normal to the flow, is weakly affected by QED corrections. As in the
classical case, its growth rate saturates at large $k_\perp$. The saturation
value is found independent of QED corrections. Also, the smallest unstable
$k_\perp$ is independent of QED corrections. Surprisingly, unstable modes found
for oblique wave vectors do \emph{not} follow the same pattern. For some, QED
corrections do reduce the growth rate. But for others, the same corrections
increase the growth rate instead. The possibility for QED effects to play a
role in un-magnetized systems is evaluated. Pair production resulting from
gamma emission by particles oscillating in the exponentially growing fields, is
not accounting for.

Title:Cosmology of Supercooled Universe,"
Abstract:  First-order phase transitions (FOPTs) are ubiquitous in physics beyond the
Standard Model (SM). Recently, models with no dimensionful parameters in the
tree-level action have been attracting much attention because they can predict
a very strong FOPT with ultra-supercooling. In this paper, we study the
cosmological signatures of such a supercooling model. As a concrete model, we
consider the SM with two additional real scalars $\phi$ and $S$, which can
realize the electroweak symmetry breaking via Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. One
of the additional scalars $S$ can naturally become a Dark Matter (DM) candidate
due to the $Z_2^{}$ symmetry of the action. We study the FOPT of this model and
calculate the Gravitational Wave (GW) signals and the thermal relic abundance
of $S$ taking the filtered effects into account. Within the envelope
approximation, we find that the GW peak amplitude can reach $\sim 10^{-10}$
around the frequency $f\sim 10^{-3}~$Hz for model parameters
$(v_\phi^{},\lambda_{\phi S}^{})\sim (200~{\rm TeV},1.6)$ where $v_\phi^{}$ is
the vacuum expectation value of $\phi$ and $\lambda_{\phi S}^{}$ is the scalar
mixing coupling. On the other hand, the filtered DM mechanism only works for
$0.8\lesssim \lambda_{\phi S}^{}\lesssim 1$, where the GW peak amplitude is
found to be quite small $\lesssim 10^{-17}$.

Title:Gravitational wave asteroseismology on cooling neutron stars,"
Abstract:  We examine the gravitational wave frequencies from neutron stars during
thermal evolution, adopting the relativistic Cowling approximation. We
particularly focus on the neutron star models, in which the direct Urca (rapid
cooling process) does not work, without the superfluidity and
superconductivity. For such models, the cooling curve hardly depends on the
equation of state (EOS) as well as the mass of neutron star, while we show that
the gravitational wave frequencies strongly depend on the both properties.
Then, we find that the frequencies of the fundamental and the 1st pressure mode
multiplied with the stellar mass are well expressed as a function of the
stellar compactness almost independently of the EOS. We also find that the
frequency of the 1st gravity mode in later phase of the thermal evolution is
strongly correlated with the stellar compactness. In addition, we derive the
empirical formula estimating the threshold mass for the onset of the direct
Urca inside the neutron star as a function of the nuclear saturation parameter.
This formula will give us a constraint on the neutron star properties, if it
would be observationally found that the direct Urca occurs (or does not work)
inside the neutron star.

Abstract:  Solitons in space-time capable of transporting time-like observers at

This is the first example of hyper-fast solitons satisfying the weak energy
condition, reopening the discussion of superluminal mechanisms rooted in
conventional physics. This article summarizes the recent finding and its

Title:Cosmological effects of Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking on QCD axion dark matter,"
Abstract:  We study cosmological effects of explicit Peccei-Quinn breaking on the QCD
axion dark matter. We find that the axion abundance decreases or increases
significantly depending on the initial position, even for a tiny Peccei-Quinn
breaking that satisfies the experimental bound of the neutron electric dipole
measurements. If the axion first starts to oscillate around a wrong vacuum and
if it gets trapped there until the false vacuum disappears due to
non-perturbative QCD effects, its abundance increases significantly and is
independent of the decay constant $f_a$, as first pointed out in [JHEP 06
(2016) 150]. Thus, the axion produced by the trapping mechanism can explain
dark matter even when the decay constant is close to the lower limit due to
stellar cooling arguments. On the other hand, if the axion starts to oscillate
about a potential minimum close to the low-energy vacuum, its abundance is
significantly reduced because of the adiabatic suppression mechanism. This
relaxes the upper limit of the axion window to large values of $f_a$. We also
discuss how the axionic isocurvature perturbation is affected by the
Peccei-Quinn breaking term, and show that it can be suppressed in both regimes.
In particular, the isocurvature bound on the inflation scale is relaxed by many
orders of magnitudes for $f_a \lesssim 10^{11}{\rm GeV}$ compared to the
conventional scenario.

which can be produced by spinning neutron stars with an asymmetry around their
rotation axis, using data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and
Advanced Virgo detectors. Four different analysis methods are used to search in
a gravitational-wave frequency band from 10 to 2048 Hz and a first frequency
derivative from $-10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ Hz/s. No statistically-significant
periodic gravitational-wave signal is observed by any of the four searches. As
a result, upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude $h_0$ are
calculated. The best upper limits are obtained in the frequency range of 100 to
200 Hz and they are ${\sim}1.1\times10^{-25}$ at 95\% confidence-level. The
minimum upper limit of $1.10\times10^{-25}$ is achieved at a frequency 111.5
Hz. We also place constraints on the rates and abundances of nearby planetary-
and asteroid-mass primordial black holes that could give rise to continuous
gravitational-wave signals.

Title:Analysis of Ringdown Overtones in GW150914,"
Abstract:  We analyze GW150914 post-merger data to understand if ringdown overtone
detection claims are robust. We find no evidence in favor of an overtone in the
data after the waveform peak. Around the peak, the Bayes factor does not
indicate the presence of an overtone, while the support for a nonzero amplitude
is sensitive to changes in the starting time much smaller than the overtone
damping time. This suggests that claims of an overtone detection are
noise-dominated. We perform GW150914-like injections in neighboring segments of
the real detector noise, and we show that noise can indeed induce artificial
evidence for an overtone.

Title:The post-Newtonian expansion in the effective theory of compact objects,"
Abstract:  Using the effective field theory framework for extended objects, we build the
effective theory of a binary system made up of the most general compact objects
in a theory of gravity as general relativity, which are objects described by
their mass, spin, charge and their internal structure. We obtain the leading
order post-Newtonian expansion to each of the relevant terms in the effective
action that has been derived using the coset construction, where the covariant
building blocks to build up the tower of invariant operators are derived from
symmetry principles. Having matched the coefficients of the theory from the
literature, we show the predictivity of our theory by obtaining well known
post-Newtonian results on spinning extended objects, as well as on charged
objects. Then, we bring new results on the polarizability and dissipation of
charged spinning compact objects.

Title:Neutrino bound states and bound systems,"
Abstract:  Yukawa interactions of neutrinos with a new light scalar boson $\phi$ can
lead to formation of stable bound states and bound systems of many neutrinos
($\nu$-clusters). For allowed values of the coupling $y$ and the scalar mass
$m_\phi$, the bound state of two neutrinos would have the size larger than
$10^{12}$ cm. Bound states with sub-cm sizes are possible for keV scale sterile
neutrinos with coupling $y > 10^{-4}$. For $\nu$-clusters we study in detail
the properties of final stable configurations. If there is an efficient cooling
mechanism, these configurations are in the state of degenerate Fermi gas. We
formulate and solve equations of the density distributions in $\nu$-clusters.
In the non-relativistic case, they are reduced to the Lane-Emden equation. We
find that (i) stable configurations exist for any number of neutrinos, $N$;
(ii) there is a maximal central density $\sim 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ determined by the
neutrino mass; (iii) for a given $m_\phi$ there is a minimal value of $Ny^3$
for which stable configurations can be formed; (iv) for a given strength of
interaction, $S_\phi = (ym_\nu/m_\phi)^2$, the minimal radius of $\nu$-clusters
exists. We discuss the formation of $\nu$-clusters from relic neutrino
background in the process of expansion and cooling of the Universe. One
possibility realized for $S_\phi > 700$ is the development of instabilities in
the $\nu$-background at $T < m_\nu$ which leads to its fragmentation. For
allowed values of $y$, cooling of $\nu$-clusters due to $\phi$-bremsstrahlung
and neutrino annihilation is negligible. The sizes of $\nu$-clusters may range
from $\sim$ km to $\sim 5$ Mpc. Formation of clusters affects perspectives of
detection of relic neutrinos.

Title:On finite time singularities in scalar field dark energy models based in the RS-II Braneworld,"
Abstract:  The quest of deciphering the true nature of dark energy has proven to be one
of the most exciting in recent times in cosmology. Various ideas have been put
forward in this regard besides the usual cosmological constant approach,
ranging from scalar field based models like Quintessence and Phantom dark
energy to various modified gravity approaches as well. A very interesting idea
then is to consider scalar field dark energy models in quantum gravitationally
corrected cosmologies with the RS-II Braneworld being one of the most well
known in this regard. So in this work, we consider RS-II Braneworld based
scalar field dark energy models and try to look out for the existence of finite
time singularities in these regimes both through a dynamical system
perspective, for which we employ the Goriely-Hyde singularity analysis method,
and a physical perspective. Our approach is general in the sense that it is not
limited to any particular class of potentials or for any constrained parameter
region for the brane tension and is valid for both Quintessence and phantom
dark energy regimes. We firstly show through Goriely-Hyde procedure that finite
time singularities can exist in these models for a limited set of initial
conditions and that this result would hold irrespective of any consideration
given to the swampland dS conjecture. We then discuss the physical nature of
the singularities that can occur in this regime, where we use a well motivated
ansatz for the Hubble parameter and show that these models of dark energy can
allow for weak singularities like those of Type III and Type IV and can also
allow for strong singularities like the Big Rip (Type I).

Title:Wavescan: multiresolution regression of gravitational-wave data,"
Abstract:  Identification of a transient gravitational-wave signal embedded into
non-stationary noise requires the analysis of time-dependent spectral
components in the resulting time series. The time-frequency distribution of the
signal power can be estimated with Gabor atoms, or wavelets, localized in time
and frequency by a window function. Such analysis is limited by the
Heisenberg-Gabor uncertainty, which does not allow a high-resolution
localization of power with individual wavelets simultaneously in time and
frequency. As a result, the temporal and spectral leakage affects the
time-frequency distribution, limiting the identification of sharp features in
the power spectrum. This paper presents a time-frequency regression method
where instead of a single window, a stack of wavelets with different windows
spanning a wide range of resolutions is used to scan power at each
time-frequency location. Such a wavelet scan (dubbed in the paper as wavescan)
extends the conventional multiresolution analysis to capture transient signals
and remove the local power variations due to the temporal and spectral leakage.
A wavelet, least affected by the leakage, is selected from the stack at each
time-frequency location to obtain the high-resolution localization of power.
The paper presents all stages of the multiresolution wavescan regression,
including the estimation of the time-varying spectrum, identification of
transient signals in the time-frequency domain, and reconstruction of the
corresponding time-domain waveforms. To demonstrate the performance of the
method, the wavescan regression is applied to the gravitational wave data from
the LIGO detectors.

Title:The Great Aurora of 4 February 1872 observed by Angelo Secchi in Rome,"
Abstract:  Observation of auroras at low latitudes is an extremely rare event typically
associated with major magnetic storms due to intense Earth-directed Coronal
Mass Ejections. Since these energetic events represent one of the most
important components of space weather their study is of paramount importance to
understand the Sun-Earth connection. Due to the rarity of these events, being
able to access all available information for the few cases studied is equally
important. Especially if we refer to historical periods in which current
accurate observations from ground-based instruments or from space were not
available. Certainly, among these events we must include the great aurora of
February 4, 1872. An event whose effects have been observed in different
regions of the Earth. What we could consider today a global event, especially
for its effects on the communication systems of the time, such as the
transatlantic cable that allowed a connection between the United States and
Europe since 1866. In this paper we describe the main results of the
observations and studies carried out by Angelo Secchi at the Observatory of the
Roman College and described in his ""Memoria sull'Aurora Elettrica del 4
Febbraio 1872"" for the Notes of the Pontifical Academy of new Lincei. This note
is extremely modern both in its multi-instrumental approach to the study of
these phenomena and in its association between solar-terrestrial connection and
technological infrastructures on the Earth. The Secchi's note definitely
represents the first example of analysis and study of an event on a global
scale, such as the Atlantic cable, affecting the Earth. What we nowadays call
an extreme space weather event.

Title:A Stable Sexaquark: Overview and Discovery Strategies,"
Abstract:  The neutral, flavor singlet scalar uuddss bound state -- the sexaquark, S --
may have a low enough mass to be stable or extremely long-lived. Here we review
mass estimates and production expectations and show that laboratory experiments
to date do not rule out such a long-lived state. An S with mass below 2054 MeV
is either absolutely stable or has a lifetime greater than the age of the
Universe. Detection of a stable S in accelerator experiments is very
challenging. An examination of the experimental literature shows that such an
effectively stable state would have escaped detection. The strongest laboratory
constraint on a long-lived S comes from the lower-bound on its formation time
in a doubly-strange hypernucleus; this constraint is, however, not stringent
enough to exclude a stable S. We develop strategies to discover it. A stable S
would be an attractive dark matter candidate. Relevant astrophysical and
cosmological observations, which show that sexaquark dark matter is consistent
with all current knowledge, are briefly reviewed.

Title:Reconstruction of Air-Shower Parameters Through the Lateral Distribution Function of Ultra-High Energy Particles,"
Abstract:  In this study, the necessity of the simulation study for exploring the
interactions of ultra-high energy particles cosmic rays was examined. Different
hadronic interaction models such as (SIBYLL, QGSJET, and EPOS) were simulated
by using air showers simulation AIRES system (version 19.04.00). Also, the
charged particle density of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) was calculated by
estimating the lateral distribution function (LDF). Moreover, the LDF
simulation of the two primary particles (proton and iron nuclei) was performed,
taking into account their primary energies effect and the zenith angle of
charged particles that produced in the EAS, within the energy range
(10^17-10^19) eV. At extremely high energies (10^17, 10^18, and 10^19) eV, new
parameters as a function of the primary energy were obtained by fitting the
lateral distribution curves of EAS using Sigmoidal function (Logistic model).
Comparison of the results showed a good agreement between the values obtained
from the parameterized LDF using Sigmoidal function with experimental results
by AGASA EAS observatory for the primaries proton as well iron nuclei, with the
production of (electron positron) pair and the charged muons secondary
particles at high energy about 10^19 eV and (theta = 0 degree).

"Title:Image Processing Methods for Coronal Hole Segmentation, Matching, and Map Classification","
Abstract:  The paper presents the results from a multi-year effort to develop and
validate image processing methods for selecting the best physical models based
on solar image observations. The approach consists of selecting the physical
models based on their agreement with coronal holes extracted from the images.
Ultimately, the goal is to use physical models to predict geomagnetic storms.
We decompose the problem into three subproblems: (i) coronal hole segmentation
based on physical constraints, (ii) matching clusters of coronal holes between
different maps, and (iii) physical map classification. For segmenting coronal
holes, we develop a multi-modal method that uses segmentation maps from three
different methods to initialize a level-set method that evolves the initial
coronal hole segmentation to the magnetic boundary. Then, we introduce a new
method based on Linear Programming for matching clusters of coronal holes. The
final matching is then performed using Random Forests. The methods were
carefully validated using consensus maps derived from multiple readers, manual
clustering, manual map classification, and method validation for 50 maps. The
proposed multi-modal segmentation method significantly outperformed SegNet,
U-net, Henney-Harvey, and FCN by providing accurate boundary detection.
Overall, the method gave a 95.5% map classification accuracy.

"Title:Axions, Time Varying CP Violation, and Baryogenesis","
Abstract:  We derive two features of axion cosmology that may have cosmological
implications, whether or not axions are dark matter: For the full range of
allowed axion masses, the evolution of a cosmic axion background allows large
CP violation until temperatures as low as $\sim$ 2 GeV, and once the axion
field begins to oscillate, the cosmological axion field's relaxation to its
ground state can briefly provide a new departure from thermal equilibrium, via
time-varying CP violation. During both of these periods, the Strong CP
violating parameter $\bar\theta$ can be as large as O(1).

Title:SiPM cross-talk in liquid argon detectors,"
Abstract:  SiPM-based readouts are becoming the standard for light detection in particle
detectors given their superior resolution and ease of use with respect to
vacuum tube photo-multipliers. However, the contributions of detection noise
such as the dark rate, cross-talk, and after-pulsing may impact significantly
their performance. In this work, we present the development of highly
reflective single-phase argon chambers capable of light yields up to 32
photo-electrons per keV, with roughly 12 being primary photo-electrons
generated by the argon scintillation, while the rest are accounted by optical
cross-talk. Furthermore, the presence of compound processes results in a
generalized Fano factor larger than 2 already at an over-voltage of 5 V.
Finally, we present a parametrization of the optical cross-talk for the FBK
NUV-HD-Cryo SiPMs at 87 K that can be extended to future detectors with
tailored optical simulations.

Title:Insensitivity of a turbulent laser-plasma dynamo to initial conditions,"
Abstract:  It has recently been demonstrated experimentally that a turbulent plasma
created by the collision of two inhomogeneous, asymmetric, weakly magnetised
laser-produced plasma jets can generate strong stochastic magnetic fields via
the small-scale turbulent dynamo mechanism, provided the magnetic Reynolds
number of the plasma is sufficiently large. In this paper, we compare such a
plasma with one arising from two pre-magnetised plasma jets whose creation is
identical save for the addition of a strong external magnetic field imposed by
a pulsed magnetic field generator (`MIFEDS'). We investigate the differences
between the two turbulent systems using a Thomson-scattering diagnostic, X-ray
self-emission imaging and proton radiography. The Thomson-scattering spectra
and X-ray images suggest that the presence of the external magnetic field has a
limited effect on the plasma dynamics in the experiment. While the presence of
the external magnetic field induces collimation of the flows in the colliding
plasma jets and the initial strengths of the magnetic fields arising from the
interaction between the colliding jets are significantly larger as a result of
the external field, the energy and morphology of the stochastic magnetic fields
post-amplification are indistinguishable. We conclude that, for turbulent
laser-plasmas with super-critical magnetic Reynolds numbers, the
dynamo-amplified magnetic fields are determined by the turbulent dynamics
rather than the seed fields and modest changes in the initial flow dynamics of
the plasma, a finding consistent with theoretical expectations and simulations
of turbulent dynamos.

Title:Analytical study of higher-order ring images of accretion disk around black hole,"
Abstract:  Gravitational lensing of a light source by a black hole leads to appearance
of higher-order images produced by photons that loop around the black hole
before reaching the observer. Higher-order images were widely investigated
numerically and analytically, in particular using so-called strong deflection
limit of gravitational deflection. After recent observations of the black hole
image, attention has been drawn to higher-order rings, which are lensed images
of the accreting matter of the black hole environment and can appear near the
boundary of the black hole shadow. In this article, we use strong deflection
limit technique to investigate higher-order ring images of luminous accretion
disc around a Schwarzschild black hole. We consider thin disk given by the
inner and outer radii and an observer located far from the black hole on the
axis of symmetry. For this configuration, it becomes possible to find the
angular radii, thicknesses, and solid angles of higher-order rings in the form
of compact analytical expressions. We show that the size of the rings is mainly
determined by the position of the inner boundary of the accretion disk, which
makes it possible to use them to distinguish between different accretion
models. Possible generalizations of our model to non-symmetric images can help
to make the estimation of black hole angular momentum. We also present the
analytical estimation of fluxes from higher-order images. Our method makes it
easy to investigate $n=2$ and $n=3$ higher-order rings, the possible
observation of which in future projects is currently being discussed.

Title:Neural network reconstruction of the dense matter equation of state from neutron star observables,"
Abstract:  The Equation of State (EoS) of strongly interacting cold and hot ultra-dense
QCD matter remains a major challenge in the field of nuclear astrophysics. With
the advancements in measurements of neutron star masses, radii, and tidal
deformabilities, from electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations,
neutron stars play an important role in constraining the ultra-dense QCD matter
EoS. In this work, we present a novel method that exploits deep learning
techniques to reconstruct the neutron star EoS from mass-radius (M-R)
observations. We employ neural networks (NNs) to represent the EoS in a
model-independent way, within the range of $\sim$1-7 times the nuclear
saturation density. The unsupervised Automatic Differentiation (AD) framework
is implemented to optimize the EoS, so as to yield through TOV equations, an
M-R curve that best fits the observations. We demonstrate that this method
works by rebuilding the EoS on mock data, i.e., mass-radius pairs derived from
a randomly generated polytropic EoS. The reconstructed EoS fits the mock data
with reasonable accuracy, using just 11 mock M-R pairs observations, close to
the current number of actual observations.

Title:Thermodynamically consistent entropic-force cosmology,"
Abstract:  We analyze the thermodynamical consistency of entropic-force cosmological
models. Our analysis is based on a generalized entropy scaling with an
arbitrary power of the Hubble radius. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy,
proportional to the area, and the nonadditive $S_{\delta=3/2}$-entropy,
proportional to the volume, are particular cases. One of the points to be
solved by entropic-force cosmology for being taken as a serious alternative to
mainstream cosmology is to provide a physical principle that points out what
entropy and temperature have to be used. We determine the temperature of the
universe horizon by requiring that the Legendre structure of thermodynamics is
preserved. We compare the performance of thermodynamically consistent
entropic-force models with regard to the available supernovae data by providing
appropriate constraints for optimizing alternative entropies and temperatures
of the Hubble screen. Our results point out that the temperature differs from
the Hawking one.

Title:Nondivergent deflection of light around a photon sphere of a compact object,"
Abstract:  We demonstrate that the location of a stable photon sphere (PS) in a compact
object is not always an edge such as the inner boundary of a black hole shadow,
whereas the location of an unstable PS is known to be the shadow edge notably
in the Schwarzschild black hole. If a static spherically symmetric (SSS)
spacetime has the stable outermost PS, the spacetime cannot be asymptotically
flat. A nondivergent deflection is caused for a photon traveling around a
stable PS, though a logarithmic divergent behavior is known to appear in most
of SSS compact objects with an unstable photon sphere. The reason for the
nondivergence is that the closest approach of a photon is prohibited in the
immediate vicinity of the stable PS when the photon is emitted from a source
(or reaches a receiver) distant from a lens object. The finite gap size depends
on the receiver and source distances from the lens as well as the lens
parameters. The mild deflection angle of light can be approximated by an
arcsine function. A class of SSS solutions in Weyl gravity exemplify the
nondivergent deflection near the stable outer PS.

Title:Proto-neutron star evolution with improved charged-current neutrino-nucleon interactions,"
Abstract:  We perform simulations of the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase of proto-neutron
stars with a new numerical code in spherical symmetry and using the
quasi-static approximation. We use for the first time the full set of
charged-current neutrino-nucleon reactions, including neutron decay and
modified Urca processes, together with the energy-dependent numerical
representation for the inclusion of nuclear correlations with random-phase
approximation. Moreover, convective motions are taken into account within the
mixing-length theory. As we vary the assumptions for computing neutrino-nucleon
reaction rates, we show that the dominant effect on the cooling timescale,
neutrino signal and composition of the neutrino-driven wind comes from the
inclusion of convective motion. Computation of nuclear correlations within the
random phase approximation, as compared to mean field approach, has a
relatively small impact.
