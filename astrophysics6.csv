"Title:
Alpha Enhancement and the Metallicity Distribution Function of Plaut's  Window","
Abstract: We present Fe, Si, and Ca abundances for 61 giants in Plaut's Window
(l=-1,b=-8.5) and Fe abundances for an additional 31 giants in a second, nearby
field (l=0,b=-8) derived from high resolution (R~25,000) spectra obtained with
the Blanco 4m telescope and Hydra multifiber spectrograph. The median
metallicity of red giant branch (RGB) stars in the Plaut field is ~0.4 dex
lower than those in Baade's Window, and confirms the presence of an iron
abundance gradient along the bulge minor axis. The full metallicity range of
our (biased) RGB sample spans -1.5<[Fe/H]<+0.3, which is similar to that found
in other bulge fields. We also derive a photometric metallicity distribution
function for RGB stars in the (l=-1,b=-8.5) field and find very good agreement
with the spectroscopic metallicity distribution. The radial velocity and
dispersion data for the bulge RGB stars are in agreement with previous results
of the BRAVA survey, and we find evidence for a decreasing velocity dispersion
with increasing [Fe/H]. The [alpha/Fe] enhancement in Plaut field stars is
nearly identical to that observed in Baade's window, and suggests that an
[alpha/Fe] gradient does not exist between b=-4 and -8. Additionally, a subset
of our sample (23 stars) appear to be foreground red clump stars that are very
metal--rich, exhibit small metallicity and radial velocity dispersions, and are
enhanced in alpha elements. While these stars likely belong to the Galactic
inner disk population, they exhibit [alpha/Fe] ratios that are enhanced above
the thin and thick disk.

Gamma-ray observations of the Be/pulsar binary 1A 0535+262 during a  giant X-ray outburst","
Abstract: Giant X-ray outbursts, with luminosities of about $ 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
are observed roughly every 5 years from the nearby Be/pulsar binary 1A
0535+262. In this article, we present observations of the source with VERITAS
at very-high energies (VHE; E$>$100 GeV) triggered by the X-ray outburst in
December 2009. The observations started shortly after the onset of the
outburst, and they provided comprehensive coverage of the episode, as well as
the 111-day binary orbit. No VHE emission is evident at any time. We also
examined data from the contemporaneous observations of 1A 0535+262 with the
Fermi/LAT at high energy photons (HE; E$>$0.1 GeV) and failed to detect the
source at GeV energies. The X-ray continua measured with the Swift/XRT and the
RXTE/PCA can be well described by the combination of blackbody and Comptonized
emission from thermal electrons. Therefore, the gamma-ray and X-ray
observations suggest the absence of a significant population of non-thermal
particles in the system. This distinguishes 1A~0535+262 from those Be X-ray
binaries (such as PSR B1259--63 and LS I +61$^{\circ}$303) that have been
detected at GeV--TeV energies. We discuss the implications of the results on
theoretical models.

Ultra High Jet Signals from Stringy No-Scale Supergravity","
Abstract: We present distinctive signatures of flipped F-Theory models with TeV-scale
vector-like particles, a \sqrt{s} = 7 TeV 1 fb^{-1} test at LHC of a class of
models well-motivated from string theory. The characteristic feature is a light
stop and gluino, both sparticles lighter than all other squarks. This unique
aspect of the supersymmetry spectrum generates an ultra-high multiplicity of

or more jets. Exclusion of the essential cuts presented here could leave the
ultra-high jet signal severely attenuated and concealed.

"Title:
Solar winds along curved magnetic field lines","
Abstract: Both remote-sensing measurements using the interplanetary scintillation (IPS)
technique and in situ measurements by the Ulysses spacecraft show a bimodal
structure for the solar wind at solar minimum conditions. At present what makes
the fast wind fast and the slow wind slow still remains to be answered. While a
robust empirical correlation exists between the coronal expansion rate $f_c$ of
the flow tubes and the speeds $v$ measured in situ, further data analysis
suggests that $v$ depends on more than just $f_c$. We examine whether the
non-radial shape of field lines, which naturally accompanies any non-radial
expansion, could be an additional geometrical factor. We solved the transport
equations incorporating the heating due to turbulent Alfv\'en waves for an
electron-proton solar wind along curved field lines given by an analytical
magnetic field model, representative of a solar minimum corona. The field line
shape is found to influence substantially the solar wind parameters, reducing
the asymptotic speed by up to $\sim 130$ km s$^{-1}$, or by $\sim 28%$ in
relative terms, compared with the case neglecting the field line curvature.
This effect was interpreted in the general framework of energy addition in the
solar wind: Relative to the straight case, the field line curvature enhances
the effective energy deposition to the subsonic flow, resulting in a higher
proton flux and a lower terminal proton speed. Our computations suggest that
the field line curvature could be a geometrical factor which, in addition to
the tube expansion, substantially influences the solar wind speed. Furthermore,
at solar minima although the field line curvature unlikely affects the polar
fast solar wind, it does help make the wind at low latitudes slow, thereby
helping better reproduce the Ulysses measurements.

Seeking Evolution of Dark Energy","
Abstract: We study how observationally to distinguish between a cosmological constant
(CC) and an evolving dark energy with equation of state $\omega(Z)$. We focus
on the value of redshift Z* at which the cosmic late time acceleration begins
and $\ddot{a}(Z^{*}) = 0$. Four $\omega(Z)$ are studied, including the
well-known CPL model and a new model that has advantages when describing the
entire expansion era. If dark energy is represented by a CC model with $\omega
\equiv -1$, the present ranges for $\Omega_{\Lambda}(t_0)$ and $\Omega_m(t_0)$
imply that Z* = 0.743 with 4% error. We discuss the possible implications of a
model independent measurement of Z* with better accuracy.

"Title:
Coupled Quintessence and the Halo Mass Function","
Abstract: A sufficiently light scalar field slowly evolving in a potential can account
for the dark energy that presently dominates the universe. This quintessence
field is expected to couple directly to matter components, unless some symmetry
of a more fundamental theory protects or suppresses it. Such a coupling would
leave distinctive signatures in the background expansion history of the
universe and on cosmic structure formation, particularly at galaxy cluster
scales. Using semi--analytic expressions for the CDM halo mass function, we
make predictions for halo abundance in models where the quintessence scalar
field is coupled to cold dark matter, for a variety of quintessence potentials.
We evaluate the linearly extrapolated density contrast at the redshift of
collapse using the spherical collapse model and we compare this result to the
corresponding prediction obtained from the non--linear perturbation equations
in the Newtonian limit. For all the models considered in this work, if there is
a continuous flow of energy from the quintessence scalar field to the CDM
component, then the predicted number of CDM haloes can only lie below that of
$\Lambda$CDM, when each model shares the same cosmological parameters today. In
the last stage of our analysis we perform a global MCMC fit to data to find the
best fit values for the cosmological model parameters. We find that for some
forms of the quintessence potential, coupled dark energy models can offer a
viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in light of the recent detections of massive
high--$z$ galaxy clusters, while other models of coupled quintessence predict a
smaller number of massive clusters at high redshift compared to $\Lambda$CDM.

"Title:
The UK Infrared Telescope M33 monitoring project. II. The star formation  history in the central square kiloparsec","
Abstract: We have conducted a near-infrared monitoring campaign at the UK InfraRed
Telescope (UKIRT), of the Local Group spiral galaxy M33 (Triangulum). The main
aim was to identify stars in the very final stage of their evolution, and for
which the luminosity is more directly related to the birth mass than the more
numerous less-evolved giant stars that continue to increase in luminosity. In
this second paper of the series, we construct the birth mass function and hence
derive the star formation history. The star formation rate has varied between
~0.002 and 0.007 M$_\odot$ yr^-1 kpc^-2. We give evidence of two epochs of a
star formation rate enhanced by a factor of a few -- one that happened \geq 6
Gyr ago and produced \geq 80% of the total mass in stars, and one around 250
Myr ago that lasted ~ 200 Myr and formed \leq 6% of the mass in stars. We
construct radial and azimuthal distributions in the image plane and in the
galaxy plane for populations associated with old first-ascent red giant branch
(RGB) stars, intermediate-age Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and young
(massive) blue and red supergiants. We find that the RGB stars follow a
spheroidal distribution, while younger stars follow a flat-disc distribution.
The intermediate-age population displays signs of a pseudo-bulge or possibly a
bar. The inner spiral arm pattern as recorded in mid-19^th-century drawings is
confirmed. We interpret our findings as evidence for an old, pressure-supported
component and a younger disc formed 6 Gyr ago, with an accretion event
occurring 250 Myr ago giving rise to the compact nucleus in M33. Our study
provides support for recent Padova stellar evolution models except that
super-AGB stars likely reach low temperatures and thus high mass-loss rates,
supporting the super-AGB nature of the progenitors of dust-enshrouded
supernovae such as SN2008S.

"Title:
Morphology, dynamics and plasma parameters of plumes and inter-plume  regions in solar coronal holes","
Abstract: Coronal plumes, which extend from solar coronal holes (CH) into the high
corona and - possibly - into the solar wind (SW), can now continuously be
studied with modern telescopes and spectrometers on spacecraft, in addition to
investigations from the ground, in particular, during total eclipses. Despite
the large amount of data available on these prominent features and related
phenomena, many questions remained unanswered as to their generation and
relative contributions to the high-speed streams emanating from CHs. An
understanding of the processes of plume formation and evolution requires a
better knowledge of the physical conditions at the base of CHs, in plumes and
in the surrounding inter-plume regions (IPR). More specifically, information is
needed on the magnetic field configuration, the electron densities and
temperatures, effective ion temperatures, non-thermal motions, plume
cross-sections relative to the size of a CH, the plasma bulk speeds, as well as
any plume signatures in the SW. In spring 2007, the authors proposed a study on
""Structure and dynamics of coronal plumes and inter-plume regions in solar
coronal holes"" to the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern to
clarify some of these aspects by considering relevant observations and the
extensive literature. This review summarizes the results and conclusions of the
study. Stereoscopic observations allowed us to include three-dimensional
reconstructions of plumes. Multi-instrument investigations carried out during
several campaigns led to progress in some areas, such as plasma densities,
temperatures, plume structure and the relation to other solar phenomena, but
not all questions could be answered concerning the details of plume generation
process(es) and interaction with the SW.

Abstract: It is shown, using the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory of gravity, that
gravitational collapse of spin-fluid fermionic matter with a stiff equation of
state in a black hole of mass $M$ forms a new universe of mass $\sim M_\ast=M^2

$M\sim 10^3$ solar masses. Our Universe may thus have originated from the
interior of an intermediate-mass black hole.

"Title:
A detailed spectral study of GRB 041219A and its host galaxy","
Abstract: GRB 041219A is one of the longest and brightest gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) ever
observed. It was discovered by the INTEGRAL satellite, and thanks to a
precursor happening about 300 s before the bulk of the burst, ground based
telescopes were able to catch the rarely-observed prompt emission in the
optical and in the near infrared bands. Here we present the detailed analysis
of its prompt gamma-ray emission, as observed with IBIS on board INTEGRAL, and
of the available X-ray afterglow data collected by XRT on board Swift. We then
present the late-time multi-band near infrared imaging data, collected at the
TNG, and the CFHT, that allowed us to identify the host galaxy of the GRB as an
under-luminous, irregular galaxy of about 5x10^9 M_Sun at best fit redshift of
z=0.31 -0.26 +0.54. We model the broad-band prompt optical to gamma-ray
emission of GRB 041219A within the internal shock model. We were able to
reproduce the spectra and light curve invoking the synchrotron emission of
relativistic electrons accelerated by a series of propagating shock waves
inside a relativistic outflow. On the other hand, it is less easy to
simultaneously reproduce the temporal and spectral properties of the infrared
data.

"Title:
A new three-parameter correlation for gamma-ray bursts with a plateau  phase in the afterglow","
Abstract: Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) have great advantages for their huge burst energies,
luminosities and high redshifts in probing the Universe. A few interesting
luminosity correlations of GRBs have been used to test cosmology models.
Especially, for a subsample of long GRBs with known redshifts and a plateau
phase in the afterglow, a correlation between the end time of the plateau phase
(in the GRB rest frame) and the corresponding X-ray luminosity has been found.
In this paper, we re-analyze the subsample and found that a significantly
tighter correlation exists when we add a third parameter, i.e. the isotropic
$\gamma$-ray energy release, into the consideration. Additionally, both long
and intermediate duration GRBs are consistent with the same three-parameter
correlation equation. It is argued that the new three-parameter correlation is
consistent with the hypothesis that the subsample of GRBs with a plateau phase
in the afterglow be associated with the birth of rapidly rotating magnetars,
and that the plateau be due to the continuous energy-injection from the
magnetar. It is suggested that the newly born millisecond magnetars associated
with GRBs might provide a good standard candle in the Universe.

"Title:
Spectral Polarization of the Redshifted 21 cm Absorption Line Toward 3C  286","
Abstract: A re-analysis of the Stokes-parameter spectra obtained of the z=0.692 21 cm
absorption line toward 3C 286 shows that our original claimed detection of
Zeeman splitting by a line-of-sight magnetic field, B_los = 87 microgauss is
incorrect. Because of an insidious software error, what we reported as Stokes V
is actually Stokes U: the revised Stokes V spectrum indicates a 3-sigma upper
limit of B_los < 17 microgauss. The correct analysis reveals an absorption
feature in fractional polarization that is offset in velocity from the Stokes I
spectrum by -1.9 km/s. The polarization position-angle spectrum shows a dip
that is also significantly offset from the Stokes I feature, but at a velocity
that differs slightly from the absorption feature in fractional polarization.
We model the absorption feature with 3 velocity components against the core-jet
structure of 3C 286. Our chisquare minimization fitting results in components
with differing (1) ratios of H I column density to spin temperature, (2)
velocity centroids, and (3) velocity dispersions. The change in polarization
position angle with frequency implies incomplete coverage of the background jet
source by the absorber. It also implies a spatial variation of the polarization
position angle across the jet source, which is observed at frequencies higher
than the 839.4 MHz absorption frequency. The multi-component structure of the
gas is best understood in terms of components with spatial scales of ~100 pc
comprised of hundreds of low-temperature (T < 200 K) clouds with linear
dimensions of about 1 pc.

"Title:
A Second Relativistic Mean Field and Virial Equation of State for  Astrophysical Simulations","
Abstract: We generate a second equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter for a wide
range of temperatures, densities, and proton fractions for use in supernovae,
neutron star mergers, and black hole formation simulations. We employ full
relativistic mean field (RMF) calculations for matter at intermediate density
and high density, and the Virial expansion of a non-ideal gas for matter at low
density. For this EOS we use the RMF effective interaction FSUGold, whereas our
earlier EOS was based on the RMF effective interaction NL3. The FSUGold
interaction has a lower pressure at high densities compared to the NL3
interaction. We calculate the resulting EOS at over 100,000 grid points in the
temperature range $T$ = 0 to 80 MeV, the density range $n_B$ = 10$^{-8}$ to 1.6
fm$^{-3}$, and the proton fraction range $Y_p$ = 0 to 0.56. We then interpolate
these data points using a suitable scheme to generate a thermodynamically
consistent equation of state table on a finer grid. We discuss differences
between this EOS, our NL3 based EOS, and previous EOSs by Lattimer-Swesty and
H. Shen et al for the thermodynamic properties, composition, and neutron star
structure. The original FSUGold interaction produces an EOS, that we call
FSU1.7, that has a maximum neutron star mass of 1.7 solar masses. A
modification in the high density EOS is introduced to increase the maximum
neutron star mass to 2.1 solar masses and results in a slightly different EOS
that we call FSU2.1. The EOS tables for FSU1.7 and FSU2.1 are available for

"Title:
Remarks on the properties of elliptical galaxies in modified Newtonian  dynamics","
Abstract: Two incorrect arguments against MOND in elliptical galaxies could be that the
equivalent circular velocity curves tend to become flat at much larger
accelerations than in spiral galaxies, and that the Newtonian dark matter halos
are more concentrated than in spirals. Here, we compare published scaling
relations for the dark halos of elliptical galaxies to the scaling relations
expected for MONDian phantom halos. We represent the baryonic content of
galaxies by spherical profiles, and their corresponding MONDian phantom halos
by logarithmic halos. We then derive the surface densities, central densities,
and phase space densities and compare them with published scaling relations. We
conclude that it is possible to get flat circular velocity curves at high
acceleration in MOND, and that this happens for baryonic distributions
described by Jaffe profiles in the region where the circular velocity curve is
flat. Moreover, the scaling relations of dark halos of ellipticals are
remarkably similar to the scaling relations of phantom halos of MOND.

SDSS J162520.29+120308.7 - a new SU UMa star in the period gap","
Abstract: We report results of an extensive world-wide observing campaign devoted to
the recently discovered dwarf nova SDSS J162520.29+120308.7 (SDSS J1625). The
data were obtained during the July 2010 eruption of the star and in August and
September 2010 when the object was in quiescence. During the July 2010
superoutburst SDSS J1625 clearly displayed superhumps with a mean period of
$P_{\rm sh}=0.095942(17)$ days ($138.16 \pm 0.02$ min) and a maximum amplitude
reaching almost 0.4 mag. The superhump period was not stable, decreasing very
rapidly at a rate of $\dot P = -1.63(14)\cdot 10^{-3}$ at the beginning of the
superoutburst and increasing at a rate of $\dot P = 2.81(20)\cdot 10^{-4}$ in
the middle phase. At the end of the superoutburst it stabilized around the
value of $P_{\rm sh}=0.09531(5)$ day. During the first twelve hours of the
superoutburst a low-amplitude double wave modulation was observed whose
properties are almost identical to early superhumps observed in WZ Sge stars.
The period of early superhumps, the period of modulations observed temporarily
in quiescence and the period derived from radial velocity variations are the
same within measurement errors, allowing us to estimate the most probable
orbital period of the binary to be $P_{\rm orb}=0.09111(15)$ days ($131.20 \pm
0.22$ min). This value clearly indicates that SDSS J1625 is another dwarf nova
in the period gap. Knowledge of the orbital and superhump periods allows us to
estimate the mass ratio of the system to be $q\approx 0.25$. This high value
poses serious problems both for the thermal and tidal instability (TTI) model
describing the behaviour of dwarf novae and for some models explaining the
origin of early superhumps.

"Title:
Emission from Hot Dust in the Infrared Spectra of Gamma-ray Bright  Blazars","
Abstract: A possible source of $\gamma$-ray photons observed from the jets of blazars
is inverse Compton scattering by relativistic electrons of infrared seed
photons from a hot, dusty torus in the nucleus. We use observations from the
Spitzer Space Telescope to search for signatures of such dust in the infrared
spectra of four $\gamma$-ray bright blazars, the quasars 4C 21.35, CTA102, and
PKS 1510$-$089, and the BL Lacertae object ON231. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) of 4C 21.35 contains a prominent infrared excess indicative
of dust emission. After subtracting a non-thermal component with a power-law
spectrum, we fit a dust model to the residual SED. The model consists of a
blackbody with temperature $\sim1200$ K, plus a much weaker optically thin
component at $\sim660$ K. The total luminosity of the thermal dust emission is
$7.9\pm0.2 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. If the dust lies in an equatorial
torus, the density of IR photons from the torus is sufficient to explain the
$\gamma$-ray flux from 4C 21.35 as long as the scattering occurs within a few
parsecs of the central engine. We also report a tentative detection of dust in
the quasar CTA102, in which the luminosity of the infrared excess is $7 \pm 2
\times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. However, in CTA102 the far-IR spectra are too
noisy to detect the $10 \mu$m silicate feature. Upper limits to the luminosity
from thermal emission from dust in PKS 1510-089, and ON231, are,
$2.3\times10^{45}$, and $6.6\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively. These
upper limits do not rule out the possibility of inverse Compton up-scattering
of IR photons to $\gamma$-ray energies in these two sources. The estimated
covering factor of the hot dust in 4C 21.35, 22%, is similar to that of
non-blazar quasars; however, 4C 21.35 is deficient in cooler dust.

Modelling Time-varying Dark Energy with Constraints from Latest  Observations","
Abstract: We introduce a set of two-parameter models for the dark energy equation of
state (EOS) $w(z)$ to investigate time-varying dark energy. The models are
classified into two types according to their boundary behaviors at the redshift
$z=(0,\infty)$ and their local extremum properties. A joint analysis based on
four observations (SNe + BAO + CMB + $H_0$) is carried out to constrain all the
models. It is shown that all models get almost the same $\chi^2_{min}\simeq
469$ and the cosmological parameters $(\Omega_M, h, \Omega_bh^2)$ with the
best-fit results $(0.28, 0.70, 2.24)$, although the constraint results on two
parameters $(w_0, w_1)$ and the allowed regions for the EOS $w(z)$ are
sensitive to different models and a given extra model parameter. For three of
Type I models which have similar functional behaviors with the so-called CPL
model, the constrained two parameters $w_0$ and $w_1$ have negative correlation
and are compatible with the ones in CPL model, and the allowed regions of
$w(z)$ get a narrow node at $z\sim 0.2$. The best-fit results from the most
stringent constraints in Model Ia give $(w_0,w_1) = (-0.96^{+0.26}_{-0.21},
-0.12^{+0.61}_{-0.89})$ which may compare with the best-fit results $(w_0,w_1)
= (-0.97^{+0.22}_{-0.18}, -0.15^{+0.85}_{-1.33})$ in the CPL model. For four of
Type II models which have logarithmic function forms and an extremum point, the
allowed regions of $w(z)$ are found to be sensitive to different models and a
given extra parameter. It is interesting to obtain two models in which two
parameters $w_0$ and $w_1$ are strongly correlative and appropriately reduced
to one parameter by a linear relation $w_1 \propto (1+w_0)$.

SGR 1806-20 distance and dust properties in molecular clouds by analysis  of a flare x-ray echoes","
Abstract: The soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20 is most famous for its giant flare from
2004, which yielded the highest gamma-ray flux ever observed on Earth. The
flare emphasized the importance of determining the distance to the SGR, thus
revealing the flare's energy output, with implications on SGRs energy budget
and giant flare rates. We analyze x-ray scattering echoes observed by Swift/XRT
following the 2006 August 6 intermediate burst of SGR 1806-20. Assuming
positions and opacities of the molecular clouds along the line-of-sight from
previous works, we derive direct constrains on the distance to SGR 1806-20,
setting a lower limit of 9.4 kpc and an upper limit of 18.6 kpc (90%
confidence), compared with a 6-15 kpc distance range by previous works. This
distance range matches an energy output of ~10^46 erg/s for the 2004 giant
flare. We further use, for the first time, the x-ray echoes in order to study
the dust properties in molecular clouds. Analyzing the temporal evolution of
the observed flux using a dust scattering model, which assumes a power-law size
distribution of the dust grains, we find a power-law index of
-3.3_{-0.7}^{+0.6} (1 sigma) and a lower limit of 0.1 micron (2 sigma) on the
dust maximal grain size, both conforming to measured dust properties in the
diffused interstellar medium (ISM). We advocate future burst follow-up
observations with Swift, Chandra and the planned NuSTAR telescopes, as means of
obtaining much superior results from such an analysis.

A method for untriggered time-dependent searches for multiple flares  from neutrino point sources","
Abstract: A method for a time-dependent search for flaring astrophysical sources which
can be potentially detected by large neutrino experiments is presented. The
method uses a time-clustering algorithm combined with an unbinned likelihood
procedure. By including in the likelihood function a signal term which
describes the contribution of many small clusters of signal-like events, this
method provides an effective way for looking for weak neutrino flares over
different time-scales. The method is sensitive to an overall excess of events
distributed over several flares which are not individually detectable. For
standard cases (one flare) the discovery potential of the method is about 15%
worse than a standard time-dependent point source analysis with unknown
duration of the flare. However, for flares sufficiently shorter than the total

"Title:
Transit surveys for Earths in the habitable zones of white dwarfs","
Abstract: To date the search for habitable Earth-like planets has primarily focused on
nuclear burning stars. I propose that this search should be expanded to cool
white dwarf stars that have expended their nuclear fuel. I define the
continuously habitable zone of white dwarfs, and show that it extends from
~0.005 to 0.02 AU for white dwarfs with masses from 0.4 to 0.9 solar masses,
temperatures less than 10,000 K, and habitable durations of at least 3 Gyr. As
they are similar in size to Earth, white dwarfs may be deeply eclipsed by
terrestrial planets that orbit edge-on, which can easily be detected with
ground-based telescopes. If planets can migrate inward or reform near white
dwarfs, I show that a global robotic telescope network could carry out a
transit survey of nearby white dwarfs placing interesting constraints on the
presence of habitable Earths. If planets were detected, I show that the survey
would favor detection of planets similar to Earth: similar size, temperature,
rotation period, and host star temperatures similar to the Sun. The Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope could place even tighter constraints on the frequency
of habitable Earths around white dwarfs. The confirmation and characterization
of these planets might be carried out with large ground and space telescopes.

"Title:
NLTE modeling of Stokes vector center-to-limb variations in the CN  violet system","
Abstract: The solar surface magnetic field is connected with and even controls most of
the solar activity phenomena. Zeeman effect diagnostics allow for measuring
only a small fraction of the fractal-like structured magnetic field. The
remaining hidden magnetic fields can only be accessed with the Hanle effect.
Molecular lines are very convenient for applying the Hanle effect diagnostics
thanks to the broad range of magnetic sensitivities in a narrow spectral
region. With the UV version of the Zurich Imaging Polarimeter ZIMPOL II
installed at the 45 cm telescope of the Istituto Ricerche Solari Locarno
(IRSOL), we simultaneously observed intensity and linear polarization
center-to-limb variations in two spectral regions containing the (0,0) and
(1,1) bandheads of the CN B 2 {\Sigma} - X 2 {\Sigma} system. Here we present
an analysis of these observations. We have implemented coherent scattering in
molecular lines into a NLTE radiative transfer code. A two-step approach was
used. First, we separately solved the statistical equilibrium equations and
compute opacities and intensity while neglecting polariza- tion. Then we used
these quantities as input for calculating scattering polarization and the Hanle
effect. We have found that it is impossible to fit the intensity and
polarization simultaneously at different limb angles in the frame- work of
standard 1D modeling. The atmosphere models that provide correct intensity
center-to-limb variations fail to fit linear polar- ization center-to-limb
variations due to lacking radiation field anisotropy. We had to increase the
anisotropy by means of a specially introduced free parameter. This allows us to
successfully interpret our observations. We discuss possible reasons for
underestimating the anisotropy in the 1D modeling.

Swift detection of an intermediately long X-ray burst from the very  faint X-ray binary XMMU J174716.1-281048","
Abstract: We report on the Swift detection of a thermonuclear X-ray burst from the
very-faint quasi-persistent neutron star X-ray binary XMMU J174716.1-281048,
which triggered the satellite's Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on 2010 August 13.
Analysis of the BAT spectrum yields an observed bolometric peak flux of ~4.5E-8
erg/cm2/s, from which we infer a source distance of <8.4 kpc. Follow-up
observations with Swift's X-ray Telescope (XRT) suggest that the event had a
duration of ~3 h and a total radiated energy of ~9E40 erg, which classify it as
an intermediately long X-ray burst. This is only the second X-ray burst ever
reported from this source. Inspection of Swift/XRT observations performed
between 2007-2010 suggests that the 2-10 keV accretion luminosity of the system
is only ~5E34 erg/s for an assumed distance of 8.4 kpc. Despite being
transient, XMMU J174716.1-281048 appears to have been continuously active since
its discovery in 2003.

The meaning inferred from the spin period distribution of normal pulsars","
Abstract: We make statistics about the number distribution of normal radio pulsars
according to the pulsar spin period. And find the physical meaning of the
traditional statistical method about this problem is very limited. According to
the statistical method proposed by us, the distribution rule is exactly the
exponentially decay with the spin period increasing, especially important,
which can be interpreted as normal radio pulsar number decays as the radiative
elements decay. It discloses that though belonging to two different extreme
scales of the universe and having different inner active mechanisms, the normal
radio pulsars and radiative elements accord with the same varying rule. And
like the half decay period of the radiative elements we can also introduce the
half decay spin period of the normal radio pulsars.

"Title:
Energy-Dependent Timing of Thermal Emission in Solar Flares","
Abstract: We report solar flare plasma to be multi-thermal in nature based on the
theoretical model and study of the energy-dependent timing of thermal emission
in ten M-class flares. We employ high-resolution X-ray spectra observed by the
Si detector of the ""Solar X-ray Spectrometer"" (SOXS). The SOXS onboard the
Indian GSAT-2 spacecraft was launched by the GSLV-D2 rocket on 8 May 2003.
Firstly we model the spectral evolution of the X-ray line and continuum
emission flux F(\epsilon) from the flare by integrating a series of isothermal
plasma flux. We find that multi-temperature integrated flux F(\epsilon) is a
power-law function of \epsilon with a spectral index (\gamma) \approx -4.65.
Next, based on spectral-temporal evolution of the flares we find that the
emission in the energy range E= 4 - 15 keV is dominated by temperatures of T=
12 - 50 MK, while the multi-thermal power-law DEM index (\gamma) varies in the
range of -4.4 and -5.7. The temporal evolution of the X-ray flux F(\epsilon,t)
assuming a multi-temperature plasma governed by thermal conduction cooling
reveals that the temperature-dependent cooling time varies between 296 and 4640
s and the electron density (n_e) varies in the range of n_e= (1.77-29.3)*10^10
cm-3. Employing temporal evolution technique in the current study as an
alternative method for separating thermal from non-thermal components in the
energy spectra, we measure the break-energy point ranging between 14 and
21\pm1.0 keV.

"Title:
The 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction studied with a composite germanium detector","
Abstract: The rate of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle of hydrogen burning is
controlled by the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction. The reaction proceeds by capture to
the ground states and several excited states in O-15. In order to obtain a
reliable extrapolation of the excitation curve to astrophysical energy, fits in
the R-matrix framework are needed. In an energy range that sensitively tests
such fits, new cross section data are reported here for the four major
transitions in the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction. The experiment has been performed
at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) 400 kV
accelerator placed deep underground in the Gran Sasso facility in Italy. Using
a composite germanium detector, summing corrections have been considerably
reduced with respect to previous studies. The cross sections for capture to the
ground state and to the 5181, 6172, and 6792 keV excited states in O-15 have
been determined at 359, 380, and 399 keV beam energy. In addition, the
branching ratios for the decay of the 278 keV resonance have been remeasured.

"Title:
Generalized LTB model with Inhomogeneous Isotropic Dark Energy:  Observational Constraints","
Abstract: We consider on-center and off-center observers in an inhomogeneous,
spherically symmetric, isocurvature (flat) concentration of dark energy with
typical size of a few Gpc. Such a concentration could be produced e.g. by a
recently formed global monopole with core size that approaches the Hubble
scale. In this case we would have what may be called `topological quintessence'
in analogy with the well-known topological inflation. We show that the minimum
comoving radius r_{0min} of such a dark energy inhomogeneity that is consistent
with the Union2 Type Ia supernovae (SnIa) data at the 3\sigma level is
r_{0min}\simeq 1.8 Gpc. As expected, the best-fit fractional dark energy
density at the center, \Omega_X,in, approaches the corresponding LCDM value
\Omega_X,in =0.73 for large enough values of the inhomogeneity radius r_0 (r_0
> 4Gpc). Using the Union2 data, we show that the maximum allowed shift
r_{obs-max} of the observer from the center of the inhomogeneity is about 0.7
r_0 which respects the Copernican principle. The model naturally predicts the
existence of a preferred axis and alignment of the low CMB multipoles. However,
the constraints on r_{obs-max} coming from the magnitude of the CMB dipole
remain a severe challenge to the Copernican principle and lead to r_{obs-max}<
110 Mpc even for an inhomogeneity radius as large as r_0=7 Gpc.

"Title:
Uniform detection of the pre-main sequence population in the 5 embedded  clusters related to the H\,II region NGC\,2174 (Sh2-252)","
Abstract: We investigate 5 embedded clusters (ECs) and the extended stellar group
itself of the prominent H\,II region NGC\,2174 (Sh2-252), which presents scarce
and heterogeneous information, coming from the optical and infrared.
Considering the discrepant values of distance and age, the clusters and the
H\,II region appear to be physically unrelated. The analysis is based on
field-star decontaminated 2MASS photometry, which allows sampling the pre-main
sequence (PMS). We find that Sh2-252A, C, E, NGC\,2175s, and Teu\,136 are small
ECs (radius within $1.0 - 2.3$\,pc) characterised by a similar age
($\sim5$\,Myr), reddening ($\aV\sim1$), distance from the Sun
($\ds\sim1.4$\,kpc), and low mass ($60-200\,\ms$). This age is consistent with
the H\,II region, the presence of O and B stars still in the MS, and the
dominance ($\ga95%$ in number) of PMS stars in colour-magnitude diagrams
(CMDs). NGC\,2175 is not a star cluster, but an extended stellar group that
encompasses the ECs Sh2-252\,A and C. It contains $\sim36%$ of the member stars
(essentially PMS) in the area, with the remaining belonging to the 2 ECs. CMDs
of the overall star-forming region and the ECs provide $\ds=1.4\pm0.4$\,kpc for
the NGC\,2174 complex, consistent with the value estimated for the
physically-related association Gem\,OB1. Our uniform approach shows that
NGC\,2174 and its related ECs (except, perhaps, for Teu\,136) are part of a
single star-forming complex. CMD similarities among the ECs and the overall
region suggest a coeval (to within $\pm5$\,Myr) star-forming event extending
for several Myr. At least 4 ECs originated in the event, together with the
off-cluster star formation that probably gave rise to the scattered stars of
NGC\,2175.

"Title:
Interpretation of neutrino flux limits from neutrino telescopes on the  Hillas plot","
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between spectral shape and detector response beyond
a simple E^-2 neutrino flux at neutrino telescopes, at the example of
time-integrated point source searches using IceCube-40 data. We use a
self-consistent model for the neutrino production, in which protons interact
with synchrotron photons from co-accelerated electrons, and we fully take into
account the relevant pion and kaon production modes, the flavor composition at
the source, flavor mixing, and magnetic field effects on the secondaries
(pions, muon, and kaons). Since some of the model parameters can be related to
the Hillas parameters R (size of the acceleration region) and B (magnetic
field), we relate the detector response to the Hillas plane. In order to
compare the response to different spectral shapes, we use the energy flux
density as a measure for the pion production efficiency times luminosity of the
source. We demonstrate that IceCube has a very good reach in this quantity for
AGN nuclei and jets for all source declinations, while the spectra of sources
with strong magnetic fields are found outside the optimal reach. We also
demonstrate where neutrinos from kaon decays and muon tracks from tau decays
can be relevant for the detector response. Finally, we point out the
complementarity between IceCube and other experiments sensitive to high-energy
neutrinos, at the example of 2004-2008 Earth-skimming neutrino data from Auger.
We illustrate that Auger, in principle, is better sensitive to the parameter
region in the Hillas plane from which the highest-energetic cosmic rays may be
expected in this model.

Relation between the 3D-geometry of the coronal wave and associated CME  during the 26 April 2008 event","
Abstract: We study the kinematical characteristics and 3D geometry of a large-scale
coronal wave that occurred in association with the 26 April 2008 flare-CME
event. The wave was observed with the EUVI instruments aboard both STEREO
spacecraft (STEREO-A and STEREO-B) with a mean speed of ~240 km/s. The wave is
more pronounced in the eastern propagation direction, and is thus, better
observable in STEREO-B images. From STEREO-B observations we derive two
separate initiation centers for the wave, and their locations fit with the
coronal dimming regions. Assuming a simple geometry of the wave we reconstruct
its 3D nature from combined STEREO-A and STEREO-B observations. We find that
the wave structure is asymmetric with an inclination towards East. The
associated CME has a deprojected speed of ~750+/-50 km/s, and shows a
non-radial outward motion towards the East with respect to the underlying
source region location. Applying the forward fitting model developed by
Thernisien, Howard, and Vourlidas (2006), we derive the CME flux rope position
on the solar surface to be close to the dimming regions. We conclude that the
expanding flanks of the CME most likely drive and shape the coronal wave.

Iterative destriping and photometric calibration for Planck-HFI,  polarized, multi-detector map-making","
Abstract: We present an iterative scheme designed to recover calibrated I, Q, and U
maps from Planck-HFI data using the orbital dipole due to the satellite motion
with respect to the Solar System frame. It combines a map reconstruction, based
on a destriping technique, juxtaposed with an absolute calibration algorithm.
We evaluate systematic and statistical uncertainties incurred during both these
steps with the help of realistic, Planck-like simulations containing CMB,
foreground components and instrumental noise, and assess the accuracy of the
sky map reconstruction by considering the maps of the residuals and their
spectra. In particular, we discuss destriping residuals for polarization
sensitive detectors similar to those of Planck-HFI under different noise
hypotheses and show that these residuals are negligible (for intensity maps) or
smaller than the white noise level (for Q and U Stokes maps), for l > 50. We
also demonstrate that the combined level of residuals of this scheme remains
comparable to those of the destriping-only case except at very low l where
residuals from the calibration appear. For all the considered noise hypotheses,
the relative calibration precision is on the order of a few 10e-4, with a
systematic bias of the same order of magnitude.

"Title:
Efficient Merger of Binary Supermassive Black Holes in Merging Galaxies","
Abstract: In spherical galaxies, binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have
difficulty reaching sub-parsec separations due to depletion of stars on orbits
that intersect the massive binary - the final-parsec problem. Galaxies that
form via major mergers are substantially nonspherical, and it has been argued
that the centrophilic orbits in triaxial galaxies might provide stars to the
massive binary at a high enough rate to avoid stalling. Here we test that idea
by carrying out fully self-consistent merger simulations of galaxies containing
central SMBHs. We find hardening rates of the massive binaries that are indeed
much higher than in spherical models, and essentially independent of the number
of particles used in the simulations. Binary eccentricities remain high
throughout the simulations. Our results constitute a fully stellar-dynamical
solution to the final-parsec problem and imply a potentially high rate of
events for low-frequency gravitational wave detectors like LISA.

Abstract: The estimated brightness of the Cygnus loop supernova remnant (SNR) at 2720,

surface brightnesses of this loop at the five frequencies in wide spectral
range, using the method we have previously developed for large radio loops. The
spectrum for mean temperatures versus frequency between the five frequencies is
estimated and the spectral index of Cygnus loop is also obtained. Also, from
our results can be concluded that Cygnus loop evolves in the low density
environment and the initial energy of supernova explosion was relatively low.
The obtained results confirm non-thermal origin of the Cygnus radio loop and
show that our method is applicable to almost all remnants.

"Title:
Measuring Lensing Magnification of Quasars by Large Scale Structure  using the Variability-Luminosity Relation","
Abstract: We introduce a technique to measure gravitational lensing magnification using
the variability of type I quasars. Quasars' variability amplitudes and
luminosities are tightly correlated, on average. Magnification due to
gravitational lensing increases the quasars' apparent luminosity, while leaving
the variability amplitude unchanged. Therefore, the mean magnification of an
ensemble of quasars can be measured through the mean shift in the
variability-luminosity relation. As a proof of principle, we use this technique
to measure the magnification of quasars spectroscopically identified in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey, due to gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters in
the SDSS MaxBCG catalog. The Palomar-QUEST Variability Survey, reduced using
the DeepSky pipeline, provides variability data for the sources. We measure the
average quasar magnification as a function of scaled distance (r/R200) from the
nearest cluster; our measurements are consistent with expectations assuming NFW
cluster profiles, particularly after accounting for the known uncertainty in
the clusters' centers. Variability-based lensing measurements are a valuable
complement to shape-based techniques because their systematic errors are very
different, and also because the variability measurements are amenable to
photometric errors of a few percent and to depths seen in current wide-field
surveys. Given the data volume expected from current and upcoming surveys, this
new technique has the potential to be competitive with weak lensing shear
measurements of large scale structure.
