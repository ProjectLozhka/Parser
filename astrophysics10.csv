"Title:
The origin of variability of the intermediate-mass black-hole ULX system  HLX-1 in ESO 243-49","
Abstract: The ultra-luminous intermediate-mass black-hole system HLX-1 in the ESO
243-49 galaxy exhibits variability with a possible recurrence time of a few
hundred days. Finding the origin of this variability would constrain the still
largely unknown properties of this extraordinary object. Since it exhibits an
intensity-hardness behavior characteristic of black-hole X-ray transients, we
have analyzed the variability of HLX-1 in the framework of the disk instability
model that explains outbursts of such systems. We find that the long-term
variability of HLX-1 is unlikely to be explained by a model in which outbursts
are triggered by thermal-viscous instabilities in an accretion disc. Possible
alternatives include the instability in a radiation-pressure dominated disk but
we argue that a more likely explanation is a modulated mass-transfer due to
tidal stripping of a star on an eccentric orbit around the intermediate-mass
black hole. We consider an evolutionary scenario leading to the creation of
such a system and estimate the probability of its observation. We conclude,
using a simplified dynamical model of the post-collapse cluster, that no more
than 1/100 to 1/10 of Mbh < 10^4 Msun IMBHs - formed by run-away stellar
mergers in the dense collapsed cores of young clusters - could have a few times
1 Msun Main-Sequence star evolve to an AGB on an orbit eccentric enough for
mass transfer at periapse, while avoiding collisional destruction or being
scattered into the IMBH by 2-body encounters. The finite but low probability of
this configuration is consistent with the uniqueness of HLX-1. We note,
however, that the actual response of a standard accretion disk to bursts of
mass transfer may be too slow to explain the observations unless the orbit is
close to parabolic (and hence even rarer) and/or additional heating, presumably
linked to the highly time-dependent gravitational potential, are invoked.

"Title:
Astrophysical Ionizing Radiation and the Earth: A Brief Review and  Census of Intermittent Intense Sources","
Abstract: Cosmic radiation backgrounds are a constraint on life, and their distribution
will affect the Galactic Habitable Zone. Life on Earth has developed in the
context of these backgrounds, and characterizing event rates will elaborate the
important influences. This in turn can be a base for comparison with other
potential life-bearing planets. In this review we estimate the intensities and
rates of occurrence of many kinds of strong radiation bursts by astrophysical
entities ranging from gamma-ray bursts at cosmological distances to the Sun
itself. Many of these present potential hazards to the biosphere: on timescales
long compared with human history, the probability of an event intense enough to
disrupt life on the land surface or in the oceans becomes large. We enumerate
the known sources of radiation and characterize their intensities at the Earth
and rates or upper limits on these quantities. When possible, we estimate a
""lethal interval"", our best estimate of how often a major extinction-level
event is probable given the current state of knowledge; we base these estimates
on computed or expected depletion of stratospheric ozone. In general, moderate
level events are dominated by the Sun, but the far more severe infrequent
events are probably dominated by gamma-ray bursts and supernovae. We note for
the first time that so-called ""short-hard"" gamma-ray bursts are a substantial
threat, comparable in magnitude to supernovae and greater than that of the
higher-luminosity long bursts considered in most past work. Given their
precursors, short bursts may come with little or no warning.

"Title:
Significance of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays","
Abstract: The study of ultra high energy cosmic rays is a very important scientific
problem. It is likely to have a huge impact in our understanding of the
universe. Very high energy particles have been observed to hit the Earth whose
origin is likely to be outside our Galaxy. Infact, particles with energies
exceeding 10^ (20) electron volts which only hit the earth once in a century
have been observed recently. The source of these high energy particles remains
a deep and fascinating mystery yet to be resolved. Recently, a huge detector 30
times the size of the city of Paris is built by Pierre Auger Observatory to
study these high energy particles. These detectors use the properties of
Cherenkov radiation to identify the particles.
Firstly, the paper will briefly explain the scientific motivation behind
studying ultra high energy cosmic rays. Secondly, this paper will try to
explain the reasons behind using water Cherenkov detectors. Thirdly, the paper
within its limited scope, will try to give an overview of the exact process by
which ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are detected using surface and water
Cherenkov detectors.

"Title:
The Luminosity Function of the NoSOCS Galaxy Cluster Sample","
Abstract: We present the analysis of the luminosity function of a large sample of
galaxy clusters from the Northern Sky Optical Cluster Survey, using latest data
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our global luminosity function (down to
M_r<= -16) does not show the presence of an upturn at faint magnitudes, while
we do observe a strong dependence of its shape on both richness and
cluster-centric radius, with a brightening of M^* and an increase of the dwarf
to giant ratio with richness, indicating that more massive systems are more
efficient in creating/retaining a population of dwarf satellites. This is
observed both within physical (0.5 R_200) and fixed (0.5 Mpc) apertures,
suggesting that the trend is either due to a global effect, operating at all
scales, or to a local one but operating on even smaller scales. We further
observe a decrease of the relative number of dwarf galaxies towards the cluster
center; this is most probably due to tidal collisions or collisional disruption
of the dwarfs since merging processes are inhibited by the high velocity
dispersions in cluster cores and, furthermore, we do not observe a strong
dependence of the bright end on the environment. We find indication that the
dwarf to giant ratio decreases with increasing redshift, within 0.07<z<0.2. We
also measure a trend for stronger suppression of faint galaxies (below M^*+2)
with increasing redshift in poor systems, with respect to more massive ones,
indicating that the evolutionary stage of less massive galaxies depends more
critically on the environment. Finally we point out that the luminosity
function is far from universal; hence the uncertainties introduced by the
different methods used to build a composite function may partially explain the
variety of faint-end slopes reported in the literature as well as, in some
cases, the presence of a faint-end upturn.

"Title:
On the anomalous secular increase of the eccentricity of the orbit of  the Moon","
Abstract: A recent analysis of a Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) data record spanning 38.7 yr
revealed an anomalous increase of the eccentricity of the lunar orbit amounting
to de/dt_meas = (9 +/- 3) 10^-12 yr^-1. The present-day models of the
dissipative phenomena occurring in the interiors of both the Earth and the Moon
are not able to explain it. We examine several dynamical effects, not modeled
in the data analysis, in the framework of long-range modified models of gravity
and of the standard Newtonian/Einsteinian paradigm. It turns out that none of
them can accommodate de/dt_meas. Many of them do not even induce long-term
changes in e; other models do, instead, yield such an effect, but the resulting
magnitudes are in disagreement with de/dt_meas. In particular, the general
relativistic gravitomagnetic acceleration of the Moon due to the Earth's
angular momentum has the right order of magnitude, but the resulting
Lense-Thirring secular effect for the eccentricity vanishes. A potentially
viable Newtonian candidate would be a trans-Plutonian massive object (Planet
X/Nemesis/Tyche) since it, actually, would affect e with a non-vanishing
long-term variation. On the other hand, the values for the physical and orbital
parameters of such a hypothetical body required to obtain the right order of
magnitude for de/dt are completely unrealistic. Moreover, they are in neat
disagreement with both the most recent theoretical scenarios envisaging the
existence of a distant, planetary-sized body and with the model-independent
constraints on them dynamically inferred from planetary motions. Thus, the
issue of finding a satisfactorily explanation for the anomalous behavior of the
Moon's eccentricity remains open.

"Title:
Intensity mapping of molecular gas during cosmic reionization","
Abstract: I present a simple calculation of the expected mean CO brightness temperature
from the large scale distribution of galaxies during cosmic reionization. The
calculation is based on the cosmic star formation rate density required to
reionize, and keep ionized, the intergalactic medium, and uses standard
relationships between star formation rate, IR luminosity, and CO luminosity
derived for star forming galaxies over a wide range in redshift. I find that
the mean CO brightness temperature resulting from the galaxies that could
reionize the Universe at $z = 8$ is $T_B \sim 1.1 (C/5) (f_{esc}/0.1)^{-1}
\mu$K, where $f_{esc}$ is the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the
first galaxies, and $C$ is the IGM clumping factor. Intensity mapping of the CO
emission from the large scale structure of the star forming galaxies during
cosmic reionization on scales of order $10^2$ to 10$^3$ deg$^2$, in combination
with HI 21cm imaging of the neutral IGM, will provide a comprehensive study of
the earliest epoch of galaxy formation.

"Title:
X-ray bursts and superbursts - recent developments","
Abstract: The past decade and a half has seen many interesting new developments in
X-ray burst research, both observationally and theoretically. New phenomena
were discovered, such as burst oscillations and superbursts, and new regimes of
thermonuclear burning identified. An important driver of the research with
present and future instrumentation in the coming years is the pursuit of
fundamental neutron star parameters. However, several other more direct
questions are also in dire need of an answer. For instance, how are superbursts
ignited and why do burst oscillations exist in burst tails? We briefly review
recent developments and discuss the role that MAXI can play. Thanks to MAXI's
large visibility window and large duty cycle, it is particularly well suited to
investigate the recurrence of rare long duration bursts such as superbursts. An
exploratory study of MAXI data is briefly presented.

particular, the broad velocity component has larger excess than the narrow one

Region where the broad component of the emission lines traces the material
expelled by the two central Super Star Clusters while the narrow one is
associated to previously existing ionized gas.

"Title:
The Planets around the Post-Common Envelope Binary NN Serpentis","
Abstract: We have detected 2 circumbinary planets around the close binary system NN
Serpentis using the orbital time delay effect measured via the sharp eclipses
of the white dwarf primary. The present pre-cataclysmic binary was formed when
the original - 2 M primary expanded into a red giant, causing the secondary
star to drop from its original orbit at a separation of about 1.4 A.U. down to
its current separation at 0.0043 A.U. A quasi-adiabatic evolution of the
circumbinary planets' orbits during the common-envelope phase would have placed
them in unstable configurations, suggesting that they may have suffered
significant orbital drag effects and were originally in much larger orbits.
Alternatively, they may have been created as 2nd-generation planets during the
last million years from the substantial amount of material lost during the
creation of the binary, making them the youngest planets known. Either solution
shows how little we actually understand about planetary formation.

The Atlas3D project - V. The CO Tully-Fisher relation of early-type  galaxies","
Abstract: We demonstrate here using both single-dish and interferometric observations
that CO molecules are an excellent kinematic tracer, even in high-mass
galaxies, allowing us to investigate for the first time the CO Tully-Fisher
relation of early-type galaxies. We compare the Tully-Fisher relations produced
using both single-dish and interferometric data and various inclination
estimation methods, and evaluate the use of the velocity profile shape as a
criterion for selecting galaxies in which the molecular gas extends beyond the
peak of the rotation curve. We show that the gradient and zero-point of the
best-fit relations are robust, independent of the velocity measure and
inclination used, and agree with those of relations derived using stellar
kinematics. We also show that the early-type CO Tully-Fisher (CO-TF) relation
is offset from the CO-TF of spirals by 0.98 \pm 0.22 magnitude at Ks-band, in
line with other results. The intrinsic scatter of the relation is found to be
\approx 0.4 magnitudes, similar to the level found in the spiral galaxy
population. Next generation facilities such as the Large Millimeter Telescope
(LMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) should allow
this technique to be used in higher-redshift systems, providing a simple new
tool to trace the mass-to-light ratio evolution of the most massive galaxies
over cosmic time.

MAXI J1659-152: the shortest orbital period black-hole binary","
Abstract: Following the detection of a bright new X-ray source, MAXI J1659-152, a
series of observations was triggered with almost all currently flying
high-energy missions. We report here on XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL and RXTE
observations during the early phase of the X-ray outburst of this transient
black-hole candidate. We confirm the dipping nature in the X-ray light curves.
We find that the dips recur on a period of 2.4139+/-0.0005 hrs, and interpret
this as the orbital period of the system. It is thus the shortest period
black-hole X-ray binary known to date. Using the various observables, we derive
the properties of the source. The inclination of the accretion disk with
respect to the line of sight is estimated to be 60-75 degrees. The companion
star to the black hole is possibly a M5 dwarf star, with a mass and radius of
about 0.15 M_sun and 0.23 R_sun, respectively. The system is rather compact
(orbital separation is about 1.35 R_sun) and is located at a distance of
roughly 7 kpc. In quiescence, MAXI J1659-152 is expected to be optically faint,
about 28 mag in the V-band.

Integral Field Spectroscopy of Massive, Kiloparsec-Scale Outflows in the  Infrared-Luminous QSO Mrk 231","
Abstract: The quasi-stellar object (QSO)/merger Mrk 231 is arguably the nearest and
best laboratory for studying QSO feedback. It hosts several outflows, including
broad-line winds, radio jets, and a poorly-understood kpc scale outflow. In
this Letter, we present integral field spectroscopy from the Gemini telescope
that represents the first unambiguous detection of a wide-angle, kpc scale
outflow from a powerful QSO. Using neutral gas absorption, we show that the
nuclear region hosts an outflow with blueshifted velocities reaching 1100 km/s,
extending 2-3 kpc from the nucleus in all directions in the plane of the sky. A
radio jet impacts the outflow north of the nucleus, accelerating it to even
higher velocities (up to 1400 km/s). Finally, 3.5 kpc south of the nucleus,
star formation is simultaneously powering an outflow that reaches more modest
velocities of only 570 km/s. Blueshifted ionized gas is also detected around
the nucleus at lower velocities and smaller scales. The mass and energy flux
from the outflow are >~2.5 times the star formation rate and >~0.7% of the
active galactic nucleus luminosity, consistent with negative feedback models of
QSOs.

Characteristics of planetary candidates observed by Kepler, II: Analysis  of the first four months of data","
Abstract: On 1 February 2011 the Kepler Mission released data for 156,453 stars
observed from the beginning of the science observations on 2 May through 16

signatures detected in this period. These are associated with 997 host stars.
Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separated
into five class-sizes; 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (radius < 1.25
Earth radii), 288 super-Earth size (1.25 Earth radii < radius < 2 Earth radii),
662 Neptune-size (2 Earth radii < radius < 6 Earth radii), 165 Jupiter-size (6
Earth radii < radius < 15 Earth radii), and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter
(15 Earth radii < radius < 22 Earth radii). In the temperature range
appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging
from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Five are less than twice the
size of the Earth. Over 74% of the planetary candidates are smaller than
Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates
increases to a peak at two to three times Earth-size and then declines
inversely proportional to area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of
the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for
geometric and sensitivity biases, are 6% for Earth-size candidates, 7% for
super-Earth size candidates, 17% for Neptune-size candidates, and 4% for

Probing the dynamics of dark energy with novel parametrizations","
Abstract: We point out that the CPL parametrization has a problem that the equation of
state $w(z)$ diverges in the far future, so that this model can only properly
describe the past evolution but cannot depict the future evolution. To overcome
such a difficulty, in this Letter we propose two novel parametrizations for
dark energy, the logarithm form $w(z)=w_0+w_1({\ln (2+z)\over 1+z}-\ln2)$ and
the oscillating form $w(z)=w_0+w_1({\sin(1+z)\over 1+z}-\sin(1))$, successfully
avoiding the future divergency problem in the CPL parametrization, and use them
to probe the dynamics of dark energy in the whole evolutionary history. Our
divergency-free parametrizations are proven to be very successful in exploring
the dynamical evolution of dark energy and have powerful prediction capability
for the ultimate fate of the universe. Constraining the CPL model and the new
models with the current observational data, we show that the new models are
more favored. The features and the predictions for the future evolution in the
new models are discussed in detail.

MaxBCG J217.95869+13.53470 is found at a redshift of 0.16, has a mass of

the presence of hot regions towards the north and west of the brightest cluster
galaxy (BCG). From the entropy distribution, regions of high entropy match the
location of the hot regions; more high entropy regions are found to the west,
and ~165 kpc to the southwest of the central AGN. A second X-ray bright galaxy
is visible ~90 kpc to the northeast of the BCG, at a redshift of 0.162. This

of the smaller cluster is ~10 percent the mass of MaxBCG J217.95869+13.53470,

J1431.8+1331, located at the center of the cluster. Two sources are visible in
the radio: a central elongated source that bends at its northern and southern

The radio sources are connected by a bridge of faint radio emission. We
speculate that the southwestern radio source is a radio relic produced by
compression of old radio plasma by a merger shock.

Exploring the Galaxy Mass-Metallicity Relation at z~3-5","
Abstract: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide a premier tool for studying
high-redshift star-forming galaxies thanks to their extreme brightness and
association with massive stars. Here we use GRBs to study the galaxy stellar
mass-metallicity (M*-Z) relation at z~3-5, where conventional direct
metallicity measurements are extremely challenging. We use the ISM
metallicities of LGRB hosts derived from afterglow absorption spectroscopy
(Z~0.01-1 solar), in conjunction with host galaxy stellar masses determined
from deep Spitzer 3.6 micron observations of 20 GRB hosts. We detect about 1/4
of the hosts with I-band magnitudes ~ -21.5 to -22.5 AB mag, and place a limit
of M > -19 mag on the remaining hosts from a stacking analysis. Using these
observations, we present the first rest-frame optical luminosity distribution
of long GRB hosts at z>3 and find that it is similar to the distribution of
long GRB hosts at z~1. In comparison to Lyman-break galaxies at the same
redshift, GRB hosts are generally fainter, but the sample is too small to rule
out an overall similar luminosity function. On the other hand, the GRB hosts
appear to be more luminous than the population of Lyman-alpha emitters at
z~3-4. Using a conservative range of mass-to-light ratios for simple stellar
populations (with ages of 70 Myr to ~2 Gyr), we infer the host stellar masses
and present mass-metallicity measurements at z~3-5 (<z> ~ 3.5). We find that
the detected GRB hosts, with M*~2e10 solar masses, display a wide range of
metallicities, but that the mean metallicity at this mass scale, Z~0.1 solar,
is lower than measurements at z<3. Combined with stacking of the non-detected
hosts with M*< 3e9 solar masses and Z<0.03 solar, we find evidence for the
existence of an M*-Z relation at z~3.5 and continued evolution of this relation
to systematically lower metallicities from z~2.

Chemical spots in the absence of magnetic field in the binary HgMn star  66 Eridani","
Abstract: According to our current understanding, a subclass of the upper main sequence
chemically peculiar stars, called mercury-manganese (HgMn), is non-magnetic.
Nevertheless, chemical inhomogeneities were recently discovered on their
surfaces. At the same time, no global magnetic fields stronger than 1-100 G are
detected by modern studies. The goals of our study are to search for magnetic
field in the HgMn binary system 66 Eri and to investigate chemical spots on the
stellar surfaces of both components. Our analysis is based on high quality
spectropolarimetric time-series observations obtained during 10 consecutive
nights with the HARPSpol instrument at the ESO 3.6-m telescope. To increase the
sensitivity of the magnetic field search we employed a least-squares
deconvolution (LSD). We used spectral disentangling to measure radial
velocities and study line profile variability. Chemical spot geometry was
reconstructed using multi-line Doppler imaging. We report a non-detection of
magnetic field in 66 Eri, with error bars 10-24 G for the longitudinal field.
Circular polarization profiles also do not indicate any signatures of complex
surface magnetic fields. For a simple dipolar field configuration we estimated
an upper limit of the polar field strength to be 60-70 G. For the HgMn
component we found variability in spectral lines of Ti, Ba, Y, and Sr with the
rotational period equal to the orbital one. The surface maps of these elements
reconstructed with the Doppler imaging technique, show relative underabundance
on the hemisphere facing the secondary component. The contrast of chemical
inhomogeneities ranges from 0.4 for Ti to 0.8 for Ba.

Viscous timescale in high mass X-ray binaries","
Abstract: Context: Low mass X-ray binaries were found to have very low frequency breaks
in their power density spectra below which the power density spectra are nearly
in white noise structure and at higher frequencies they approximately follow
the $P_\nu \propto \nu^{-1.3}$ law.
Aims: In 2005, Gilfanov and Arefiev studied X-ray variability of persistent
LMXBs in the $10^{-8}-10^{-1}$ Hz frequency range and
To determine whether high mass X-ray binary power density spectra have
similar properties and the findings for low mass X-ray binaries are also valid
for high mass binaries, we analyzed the time series of high mass X-ray binary
sources produced by All Sky Monitor of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer.
Method: We obtained the power density spectra of the high mass X-ray binaries
using the cosine transform of autocorrelation function.
Results: We identified break frequencies for seven sources, namely OAO
1657-415, SS 433, Vela X-1, SMC X-1, 4U 1700-377, GX 301-2, and LMC X-1. The
normalized break frequencies with respect to the orbital frequency
($f_{break}/f_{orbit}$) for sources OAO 1657-415, SS 433, SMC X-1 and LMC X-1
are consistent with those of Roche lobe overflow systems. The other high mass
X-ray binary systems, Vela X-1, GX 301-2, and 4U 1700-377, however, have larger
break frequency ratios, $f_{break}/f_{orb} $, which are indicative of short
viscous times. These are all wind-accreting sources and the stellar winds in
the systems allow the formation of only short radius discs.
Consequently, we qualitatively distinguished the Roche lobe overflow binaries
from the wind accreting system by comparing their normalized break frequencies.

"Title:
Study of Molecular Clouds associated with HII Regions","
Abstract: The properties of molecular clouds associated with 10 HII regions were
studied using CO observations. We identified 142 dense clumps within our sample
and found that our sources are divided into two categories: those with clumps
that show a power law size-line width relation (Type I) and those which do not
show any relation (Type II). The clumps in the Type I sources have larger power
law indices than found in previous studies. The clumps in the Type II sources
have larger line widths and show evidence (such as outflows) of current active
star formation within the clump. We suggest that the lack of a size-line width
relation is a sign of current active star formation. Massive clumps seem to
have similar masses calculated by different methods but lower mass clumps have
larger virial masses compared to velocity integrated and LTE mass. We found no
relation between mass distribution of the clumps and distance from the H~II
region ionization front, but a weak decrease of the excitation temperature with
increasing distance from the ionized gas. The clumps in collected shells around
the H~II regions have slightly larger line widths but no relation was found
between line width and distance from the H~II region, which probably indicates
that the internal dynamics of the clumps are not affected by the ionized gas.
Internal sources of turbulence, such as outflows and stellar winds from young
proto-stars may have a more important role on the molecular gas dynamics. We
suggest that large line width and larger size-line width power law indices are
therefore the initial characteristics of clumps in massive star forming clouds
and that some may evolve into objects similar to our Type II sources, where
local ""second generation"" stars are forming and eliminating the size-line-width
relation.

Constraints on massive sterile neutrino species from current and future  cosmological data","
Abstract: Sterile massive neutrinos are a natural extension of the Standard Model of
elementary particles. The energy density of the extra sterile massive states
affects cosmological measurements in an analogous way to that of active
neutrino species. We perform here an analysis of current cosmological data and
derive bounds on the masses of the active and the sterile neutrino states as
well as on the number of sterile states. The so-called (3+2) models with three
sub-eV active massive neutrinos plus two sub-eV massive sterile species is well
within the 95% CL allowed regions when considering cosmological data only. If
the two extra sterile states have thermal abundances at decoupling, Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis bounds compromise the viability of (3+2) models. Forecasts from
future cosmological data on the active and sterile neutrino parameters are also
presented. Independent measurements of the neutrino mass from tritium beta
decay experiments and of the Hubble constant could shed light on sub-eV massive
sterile neutrino scenarios.

Accretion Events in Binary Systems: AZ Cas and VV Cep","
Abstract: The sudden lengthening of orbital period of VV Cep eclipsing binary by about
1% was observed in the last epoch. The mass transfer and/or mass loss are most
possible explanations of this event. The photometric behaviour of AZ Cas, the

in this system, too.

"Title:
Resolving the Sin(I) degeneracy in Low-Mass Multi-Planet Systems","
Abstract: Long-term orbital evolution of multi-planet systems under tidal dissipation
often converges to a stationary state, known as the tidal fixed point. The
fixed point is characterized by a lack of oscillations in the eccentricities
and apsidal alignment among the orbits. Quantitatively, the nature of the fixed
point is dictated by mutual interactions among the planets as well as
non-Keplerian effects. We show that if a roughly coplanar system hosts a hot,
sub-Saturn mass planet, and is tidally relaxed, separation of planet-planet
interactions and non-Keplerian effects in the equations of motion leads to a
direct determination of the true masses of the planets. Consequently, a
""snap-shot"" observational determination of the orbital state resolves the
sin(I) degeneracy, and opens up a direct avenue towards identification of the
true lowest-mass exo-planets detected. We present an approximate, as well as a
general, mathematical framework for computation of the line of sight
inclination of secular systems, and apply our models illustratively to the 61
Vir system. We conclude by discussing the observability of planetary systems to
which our method is applicable and we set our analysis into a broader context
by presenting a current summary of the various possibilities for determining
the physical properties of planets from observations of their orbital states.

Magnetic fields in galactic haloes","
Abstract: Magnetic fields on a range of scales play a large role in the ecosystems of
galaxies, both in the galactic disk and in the extended layers of gas away from
the plane. Observing magnetic field strength, structure and orientation is
complex, and necessarily indirect. Observational data of magnetic fields in the
halo of the Milky Way are scarce, and non-conclusive about the large-scale
structure of the field. In external galaxies, various large-scale
configurations of magnetic fields are measured, but many uncertainties about
exact configurations and their origin remain. There is a strong interaction
between magnetic fields and other components in the interstellar medium such as
ionized and neutral gas and cosmic rays. The energy densities of these
components are comparable on large scales, indicating that magnetic fields are
not passive tracers but that magnetic field feedback on the other interstellar
medium components needs to be taken into account.

Cosmology with Hypervelocity Stars","
Abstract: In the standard cosmological model, the merger remnant of the Milky Way and
Andromeda (Milkomeda) will be the only galaxy remaining within our event
horizon once the Universe has aged by another factor of ten, ~10^{11} years
after the Big Bang. After that time, the only extragalactic sources of light in
the observable cosmic volume will be hypervelocity stars being ejected
continuously from Milkomeda. Spectroscopic detection of the velocity-distance

precise measurement of the vacuum mass density as well as the local matter
distribution. Already in the near future, the next generation of large
telescopes will allow photometric detection of individual stars out to the edge
of the Local Group, and may target the ~10^{5+-1} hypervelocity stars that
originated in it as cosmological tracers.

heating from the Sun. Both HC3N and HCO+ were detected in comets C/2002 X5 and

the Sun screening of the photodissociation by the Sun UV radiation plays a
non-negligible role. Acceleration of the gas expansion velocity and day-night
asymmetry is also measured and modeled. The CS photodissociation lifetime was
constrained to be about 2.5 x 10**-5 s-1 at r_h = 1 AU. The relative abundances

enrichment in CS in cometary comae (CS/HCN proportional to r_h**-0.8) is
confirmed in all three comets. The CH3OH/HCN production rate ratio decreases at
low r_h. The HC3N/HCN production rate ratio in comet C/2002 X5 is four times

Nonlinear Perturbation Theory Integrated with Nonlocal Bias,  Redshift-space Distortions, and Primordial Non-Gaussianity","
Abstract: The standard nonlinear perturbation theory of the gravitational instability
is extended to incorporate the nonlocal bias, redshift-space distortions, and
primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that local Eulerian bias is not generally
compatible to local Lagrangian bias in nonlinear regime. The Eulerian and
Lagrangian biases are nonlocally related order by order in the general
perturbation theory. The relation between Eulerian and Lagrangian kernels of
density perturbations with biasing are derived. The effects of primordial
non-Gaussianity and redshift-space distortions are also incorporated in our
general formalism, and diagrammatic methods are introduced. Vertex resummations
of higher-order perturbations in the presence of bias are considered.
Resummations of Lagrangian bias are shown to be essential to handle biasing
schemes in a general framework.

Gas and Dust Toward DG Tau B and VV CrA","
Abstract: We present findings for DG Tau B and VV CrA, two of the objects observed in
our Spitzer IRS project to search for molecular absorption in edge-on disks,
along with near-IR spectroscopy of the CO fundamental transitions and mid-IR
imaging. While the only gas absorption seen in the Spitzer IRS spectrum toward
DG Tau B is CO$_{2}$, we use gas abundances and gas/ice ratios to argue that we
are probing regions of the disk that have low organic molecule abundances. This
implies the rarity of detecting molecular absorption toward even edge-on disks
with Spitzer IRS is a result of high dependence on the line of sight. We also
argue the disk around DG Tau B shows high amounts of grain growth and settling.
For VV CrA, we use the silicate absorption feature to estimate a dust
extinction, and model the disk with a spectral energy distribution fitting tool
to give evidence in support of the disk geometry presented by Smith et al.
(2009) where the Primary disk is the main source of extinction toward the

"Title:
Measuring the Sizes, Shapes, Surface Features and Rotations of Solar  System Objects with Interferometry","
Abstract: We consider the application of interferometry to measuring the sizes and
shapes of small bodies in the solar system that cannot be spatially resolved by
today's single-dish telescopes. Assuming ellipsoidal shapes, our results
indicate that interferometers can measure the size of an object to better than
15% uncertainty if the limb-darkening is unknown. Assuming a Minnaert
scattering model, one can theoretically derive the limb-darkening parameters
from simultaneous measurements of visibilities at several different projected
baseline lengths to improve the size and shape determination to an accuracy of
a few percent. With a 3-D shape model for the dwarf planet Haumea, we
demonstrate that when photometric light curve, visibility light curve, and
visibility phase center displacement are combined, the rotational period and
sense of rotation can all be derived, and the rotational pole can be estimated.
Because of its elongated shape and the dark red spot, the rotation of Haumea
causes its optical photocenter to move in a loop on the sky, extending of ~80
\muas without the dark red spot, and ~200 \muas with it. Such movements are
easily detectable by space-based astrometric interferometer designed e.g. for
planet detection. As an example, we consider the possible contributions to the
study of small bodies in the solar system by the Space Interferometry Mission.
We show that such a mission could make substantial contributions in
characterizing the fundamental physical properties of the brightest Kuiper Belt
Objects and Centaurs as well as a large number of main belt asteroids. We
compile a list of Kuiper Belt Objects and Centaurs that are potentially
scientifically interesting and observable by such missions.

"Title:
A new approach to long-term reconstruction of the solar irradiance leads  to large historical solar forcing","
Abstract: The variable Sun is the most likely candidate for natural forcing of past
climate change on time scales of 50 to 1000 years. Evidence for this
understanding is that the terrestrial climate correlates positively with solar
activity. During the past 10,000 years, the Sun has experienced substantial
variations in activity and there have been numerous attempts to reconstruct
solar irradiance. While there is general agreement on how solar forcing varied
during the last several hundred years --- all reconstructions are proportional
to the solar activity --- there is scientific controversy on the magnitude of
solar forcing. We present a reconstruction of the Total and Spectral Solar
Irradiance covering 130 nm--10 $\mu$m from 1610 to the present with annual
resolution and for the Holocene with 22-year resolution. We assume that the
minimum state of the quiet Sun in time corresponds to the observed quietest
area on the present Sun. Then we use available long-term proxies of the solar
activity, which are $^{10}$Be isotope concentrations in ice cores and 22-year
smoothed neutron monitor data, to interpolate between the present quiet Sun and
the minimum state of the quiet Sun. This determines the long-term trend in the
solar variability which is then superposed with the 11-year activity cycle
calculated from the sunspot number. The time-dependent solar spectral
irradiance from about 7000 BC to the present is then derived using a
state-of-the-art radiation code. We derive a total and spectral solar
irradiance that was substantially lower during the Maunder minimum than
observed today. The difference is remarkably larger than other estimations
published in the recent literature. The magnitude of the solar UV variability,
which indirectly affects climate is also found to exceed previous estimates. We
discuss in details the assumptions which leaded us to this conclusion.

Minimal Dark Matter and Leptogenesis","
Abstract: A Dirac fermion carrying an integral weak isospin and the vanishing
hypercharge is considered as its neutral component can be a promising dark
matter candidate (called the minimal dark matter) whose mass is of order 100
GeV. While the symmetric population annihilates away due to a rapid gauge
interaction, its asymmetric abundance is supposed to be produced by the decay
of a right-handed neutrino superfield in the supersymmetric type I seesaw
mechanism. The efficiencies for generating the dark matter and lepton
asymmetries are calculated by solving a set of approximate Boltzmann equations.
A spectacular feature of this scenario is the existence of a long-lived singly-
or multiply-charged scalar and a shorter-lived singly-charged fermion whose
tracks can be readily looked for at the LHC.

Prominent Polarized Flares of the Blazars AO 0235+164 and PKS 1510-089","
Abstract: We report on multi-band photometric and polarimetric observations of the
blazars AO 0235+164 and PKS 1510-089. These two blazars were active in 2008 and
2009, respectively. In these active states, prominent short flares were
observed in both objects, having amplitudes of >1 mag within 10 d. The $V-J$
color became bluer when the objects were brighter in these flares. On the other
hand, the color of PKS 1510-089 exhibited a trend that it became redder when it
was brighter, except for its prominent flare. This redder-when-brighter trend
can be explained by the strong contribution of thermal emission from an
accretion disk. The polarization degree increased at the flares, and reached
>25 % at the maxima. We compare these flares in AO 0235+164 and PKS 1510-089
with other short flares which were detected by our monitoring of 41 blazars.
Those two flares had one of the largest variation amplitudes in both flux and
polarization degree. Furthermore, we found a significant positive correlation
between the amplitudes of the flux and polarization degree in the short flares.
It indicates that the short flares originate from the region where the magnetic
field is aligned.

"Title:
Simulated spectral states of AGN and observational predictions","
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galactic black hole binaries (GBHs)
represent two classes of accreting black holes. They both contain an accretion
disc emitting a thermal radiation, and a non-thermal X-ray emitting corona.
GBHs exhibit state transitions, and their spectral states are characterized by
different luminosity levels and shapes of the spectral energy distribution
(SED). If AGN transitioned in a similar way, the characteristic timescales of
such transitions would exceed ~10^5 years. Thus, the probability to observe an
individual AGN transiting between different spectral states is very low. In
this paper we follow a spectral evolution of a GBH, GRO~J1655-40, and then
apply its SED evolution pattern to a simulated population of AGN under an
assumption that a large sample of AGN should contain a mixture of sources in
different spectral states. We model the X-ray spectra of GRO J1655-40 with the
eqpair model and then scale the best-fitting models with the black hole mass to
simulate the AGN spectra. We compare the simulated and observed AGN SEDs to
determine the spectral states of observed Type 1 AGN, LINER and NLS1
populations. We conclude that bright Type 1 AGN and NLS1 galaxies are in a
spectral state similar to the soft spectral state of GBHs, while the spectral
state of LINERs may correspond to the hard spectral state of GBHs. We find that
taking into account a spread in the black hole masses over several orders of
magnitude, as in the observed AGN samples, leads to a correlation between the
X-ray loudness and the monochromatic luminosity at 2500A, similar to that found
in observations. We predict however that the correlation changes its sign
around a critical luminosity of L_crit ~ 0.01 L_E.

Magnetic fields during primordial star formation","
Abstract: Recent FERMI observations provide a lower limit of 10^{-15} G for the
magnetic field strength in the intergalactic medium (IGM). This is consistent
with theoretical expectations based on the Biermann battery effect, which
predicts such IGM fields already at redshifts z~10. During gravitational
collapse, such magnetic fields can be amplified by compression and by
turbulence, giving rise to the small-scale dynamo. On scales below the Jeans
length, the eddy turnover timescale is much shorter than the free-fall
timescale, so that saturation can be reached during collapse. This scenario has
been tested and confirmed with magneto-hydrodynamical simulations following the
collapse of a turbulent, weakly magnetized cloud. Based on a spectral analysis,
we confirm that turbulence is injected on the Jeans scale. For the power
spectrum of the magnetic field, we obtain the Kazantsev slope which is
characteristic for the small-scale dynamo. A calculation of the critical length
scales for ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation shows that these scales
are always small enough to allow significant amplification of the magnetic
field by small-scale eddies. We discuss potential implications for the
protostellar accretion disk, with particular focus on the magneto-rotational
instability, which may change the morphology of the disk and reduce the
accretion rate by a factor of a few.

The Swift-BAT survey reveals the orbital period of three high-mass X-ray  binaries","
Abstract: A growing number of previously hidden Galactic X-ray sources are now detected
with recent surveys performed by the Integral and Swift satellites. Most of
these new sources eluded past surveys due to their large local X-ray extinction
and consequent low soft X-ray flux. The Swift-BAT performs daily monitoring of
the sky in an energy band (15-150 keV) which is only marginally affected by
X-ray extinction, thus allowing for the search of long periodicities in the
light curve and identification of the nature of the X-ray sources. We performed
a period search using the folding technique in the Swift-BAT light curves of
three Integral sources: IGR J05007-7047, IGR J13186-6257 and IGR J17354-3255.
Their periodograms show significant peaks at 30.77$\pm$0.01 d, 19.994$\pm$0.01
d and 8.448$\pm$0.002 d, respectively. We estimate the significance of these
features from the chi squared distribution of all the trials, finding a
probability less than 1.5$\times10^{-4}$ that the detections occurred due to
chance. We complement our analysis with the study of their broadband X-ray
emission. We identify the periodicities with the orbital periods of the
sources. The periods are typical for the wind accretors X-ray binaries and we
support this identification showing that also their energy spectra are
compatible with an X-ray spectral emission characteristic of high-mass X-ray
binaries. The spectrum of IGR J05007-704 that resides in the Large Magellanic

"Title:
Laboratory comparison of coronagraphic concepts under dynamical seeing  and high-order adaptive optics correction","
Abstract: The exoplanetary science through direct imaging and spectroscopy will largely
expand with the forthcoming development of new instruments at the VLT (SPHERE),
Gemini (GPI), Subaru (HiCIAO), and Palomar (Project 1640) observatories. All
these ground-based adaptive optics instruments combine extremely high
performance adaptive optics (XAO) systems correcting for the atmospheric
turbulence with advanced starlight-cancellation techniques such as coronagraphy
to deliver contrast ratios of about 10-6 to 10-7. While the past fifteen years
have seen intensive research and the development of high-contrast coronagraph
concepts, very few concepts have been tested under dynamical seeing conditions
(either during sky observation or in a realistic laboratory environment). In
this paper, we discuss the results obtained with four different coronagraphs --
phase and amplitude types -- on the High-Order Testbench (HOT), the adaptive
optics facility developed at ESO. This facility emphasizes realistic conditions
encountered at a telescope (e.g., VLT), including a turbulence generator and a
high-order adaptive optics system. It enables to evaluate the performance of
high-contrast coronagraphs in the near-IR operating with an AO-corrected PSF of
90% Strehl ratio under 0.5 arcsec dynamical seeing.

"Title:
A Photometric System for Detection of Water and Methane Ices on Kuiper  Belt Objects","
Abstract: We present a new near-infrared photometric system for detection of water ice
and methane ice in the solar system. The system consists of two medium-band
filters in the K-band region of the near-infrared, which are sensitive to water
ice and methane ice, plus continuum observations in the J-band and Y-band. The
primary purpose of this system is to distinguish between three basic types of
Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) --- those rich in water ice, those rich in methane
ice, and those with little absorbance. In this work, we present
proof-of-concept observations of 51 KBOs using our filter system, 21 of which
have never been observed in the near-IR spectroscopically. We show that our
custom photometric system is consistent with previous spectroscopic
observations while reducing telescope observing time by a factor of 3. We use
our filters to identify Haumea collisional family members, which are thought to
be collisional remnants of a much larger body and are characterized by large
fractions of water ice on their surfaces. We add 2009 YE7 to the Haumea
collisional family based on our water ice band observations(J-H2O = -1.03 +/-
0.27) which indicate a high amount of water ice absorption, our calculated
proper orbital elements, and the neutral optical colors we measured, V-R = 0.38
+/- 0.04, which are all consistent with the rest of the Haumea family. We
identify several objects dynamically similar to Haumea as being distinct from
the Haumea family as they do not have water ice on their surfaces. In addition,
we find that only the largest KBOs have methane ice, and we find that Haumea
itself has significantly less water ice absorption than the smaller Haumea
family members. We find no evidence for other families in the Kuiper Belt.

"Title:
On the nature of the in-ecliptic interplanetary magnetic field's  two-humped distribution at 1AU","
Abstract: It was found out that the distribution's shape of the in-ecliptic (as well as
radial) component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) significantly
changes with the heliocentric distance, which poorly corresponds to classical
models of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) expansion.
For example, distributions of the radial photospheric and the source surface's
magnetic field in the ecliptic plane are Gaussian-like, the distribution of the
radial IMF component at the Earth orbit demonstrates two-humped shape, and it
becomes again Gaussian-like at 3-4 AU. These differences lead to lack of
correspondence between simulations of the IMF behaviour at 1 AU and
observations. Our results indicate that picture of the IMF expansion into space
is more complicated than usually considered, and the sector structure is not
the only source of the two-humped shape of the in-ecliptic or radial IMF
component. We have analysed data from different spacecraft at the distances
from 0.29 AU to 4 AU and found that the shape of the radial IMF component
distribution strongly depends on a heliocentric distance and a heliolatitude.
The ""two-humped IMF"" effect is most brightly expressed at low heliolatitudes at
0.7-2 AU, but it fully disappears at 3-4 AU. There is also dependence of the
IMF distributions' view on a solar cycle due to active processes, such as solar
flares and CMEs. We suppose that the in-ecliptic solar wind field at 1 AU is
influenced by solar active regions in a high degree, and actually the
distribution is the three-humped: two humps correspond to the IMF from the
middle and high heliolatitudes and the third one is the theoretically expected
distribution from the solar field nearby the heliomagnetic equator. Vanishing
of the IMF zero-component with the distance from the Sun partially could be a
result of a magnetic reconnection at the current sheets in the solar wind.

"Title:
Tidal Evolution of Close-in Extrasolar Planets: High Stellar Q from New  Theoretical Models","
Abstract: In recent years it has been shown that the tidal coupling between extrasolar
planets and their stars could be an important mechanism leading to orbital
evolution. Both the tides the planet raises on the star and vice versa are
important and dissipation efficiencies ranging over four orders of magnitude
are being used. In addition, the discovery of extrasolar planets extremely
close to their stars has made it clear that the estimates of the tidal quality
factor, Q, of the stars based on Jupiter and its satellite system and on main
sequence binary star observations are too low, resulting in lifetimes for the
closest planets orders of magnitude smaller than their age. We argue that those
estimates of the tidal dissipation efficiency are not applicable for stars with
spin periods much longer than the extrasolar planets' orbital period. We
address the problem by applying our own values for the dissipation efficiency
of tides, based on our numerical simulations of externally perturbed volumes of
stellar-like convection. The range of dissipation we find for main-sequence
stars corresponds to stellar $Q_*$ of $10^8$ to $3{\times}10^9$. The derived
orbit lifetimes are comparable to, or much longer than the ages of the observed
extrasolar planetary systems. The predicted orbital decay transit timing
variations due to the tidal coupling are below the rate of ms/yr for currently
known systems, but within reach of an extended Kepler mission provided such
objects are found in its field.

"Title:
Hot Super Earths: Tidally Downsized hot jupiters? The hot jupiter around  the metal poor star explained","
Abstract: Recent Kepler observations revealed an unexpected abundance of ""hot""
Earth-size to Neptune-size planets in the inner ~0.02-0.2 AU from their parent
stars. Another ""oddity"" of recent observations is the discovery of a hot
jupiter planet around a very metal poor star of extragalactic origin.
We point out that these observations have natural explanations in the
framework of the Tidal Downsizing hypothesis, a new and an alternative model
for planet formation. We show that disassociation of molecular hydrogen leads
to the ""second collapse"" of the giant planet embryos. The collapse forms much
denser fluid configurations, closely resembling isolated proto-giant planets on
the Hayashi track before they enter the degenerate ""main sequence"" phase. We
find that, in the early gas-rich phase of proto-planetary discs, these
configurations migrate inward more rapidly than they contract. They are
therefore tidally disrupted at characteristic distance of ~ 0.05 -0.1 AU from
their parent stars. The disruption is likely to leave solid cores behind, which
we identify with the hot Super-Earths observed by Kepler. In addition, we show
that single hot jupiters (also found by the Kepler telescope) are not
surprising in the context of TD hypothesis. Finally, formation of coreless
giant planets by the second collapse of the giant embryos occurs for either
very massive embryos (more than ~ 20 Jupiter masses) or very metal poor ones.
We suggest that this process explains the extra-galactic hot jupiter.

A Compton-thick AGN at z~5 in the 4 Ms Chandra Deep Field South","
Abstract: We report the discovery of a Compton-thick Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) at
z=4.76 in the 4 Ms Chandra Deep Field South. This object was selected as a
V-band dropout in HST/ACS images and previously recognized as an AGN from
optical spectroscopy. The 4 Ms Chandra observations show a significant
(~4.2sigma) X-ray detection at the V-band dropout position. The X-ray source
displays a hardness ratio of HR=0.23+-0.24, which, for a source at z~5, is
highly suggestive of Compton-thick absorption. The source X-ray spectrum is
seen above the background level in the energy range of ~0.9-4 keV, i.e., in the
rest-frame energy range of ~5-23 keV. When fixing the photon index to
Gamma=1.8, the measured column density is N_H=1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.5} x 10^{24}
cm^{-2}, which is Compton-thick. To our knowledge, this is the most distant
heavily obscured AGN, confirmed by X-ray spectral analysis, discovered so far.
The intrinsic (de-absorbed), rest-frame luminosity in the 2-10 keV band is ~2.5
x 10^{44} erg s^{-1}, which places this object among type-2 quasars. The
Spectral Energy Distribution shows that massive star formation is associated
with obscured black hole accretion. This system may have then been caught
during a major co-eval episode of black hole and stellar mass assembly at early
times. The measure of the number density of heavily obscured AGN at high
redshifts will be crucial to reconstruct the BH/galaxy evolution history from
the beginning.

"Title:
Wind-Enhanced Interaction of Radiation and Dust (WEIRD) and the Growth  and Maintenance of Local Dust Storms on Mars","
Abstract: A radiative-dynamic positive feedback mechanism (Wind Enhanced Interaction of
Radiation and Dust: WEIRD) for localized Mars dust disturbances was previously
found to operate in highly idealized numerical experiments. Numerical
simulations are used to test for the presence and quantitative effect of the
radiative-dynamic WEIRD feedback mechanism under more realistic conditions.
Comparisons between cases where lifted dust is radiatively active and
radiatively passive elucidate the importance of the dust radiative forcing on
the thermodynamic and kinematic structure of the atmosphere. The WEIRD feedback
mechanism does operate under realistic conditions, although it can be masked
and diminished by a variety of other forcing mechanisms. Globally increased
dust loading is found to accelerate the local winds while simultaneously
diminishing the impact of local physiographical forcing. Local enhancements of
dust produce a thermal and dynamical response that resembles many of the
essential features seen in the idealized experiments. The development of a warm
core low, rotational wind tendencies and convergence boundaries intersecting at
the center of the strongest dust storms are consistent with WEIRD. Local and
regional storms are effective at producing elevated dust layers above the
boundary layer aided by the radiative forcing of the dust. Ubiquitous and
persistent thermal circulations associated with topography can also inject dust
into the free atmosphere above the planetary boundary layer, but they are less
efficient than the dust storms. High concentrations of dust in the lowest
levels of the atmosphere produce a significant and dramatic heating of the
ground and the near-surface air despite greatly reduced insolation at the
surface.

First Sunquake of Solar Cycle 24 Observed by Solar Dynamics Observatory","
Abstract: The X2.2-class solar flare of February 15, 2011, produced a powerful
`sunquake' event, representing a seismic response to the flare impact. The
impulsively excited seismic waves formed a compact wavepacket traveling through
the solar interior and appeared on the surface as expanding wave ripples. The
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), instrument on SDO, observes variations
of intensity, magnetic field and plasma velocity (Dopplergrams) on the surface
of Sun almost uninterruptedly with high resolution (0.5 arcsec/pixel) and high
cadence (45 sec). The flare impact on the solar surface was observed in the
form of compact and rapid variations of the HMI observables (Doppler velocity,
line-of-sight magnetic field and continuum intensity). These variations, caused
by the impact of high-energy particles in the photosphere, formed a typical
two-ribbon flare structure. The sunquake can be easily seen in the raw
Dopplergram differences without any special data processing. The source of this
quake was located near the outer boundary of a very complicated complicated
sunspot region, NOAA 1158, in a sunspot penumbra and at the penumbra boundary.
This caused an interesting plasma dynamics in the impact region. I present some
preliminary results of analysis of the near-real-time data from HMI, and
discuss properties of the sunquake and the flare impact sources.

Exoplanets transmission spectroscopy: accounting for eccentricity and  longitude of periastron. Superwinds in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b?","
Abstract: Context: Several studies have so far placed useful constraints on planetary
atmospheric properties using transmission spectrsocopy, and in the case of
HD209458b even the radial velocity of the planet during the transit event has
been reconstructed opening a new range of possibilities. AIMS. In this
contribution we highlight the importance to account for the orbital
eccentricity and longitude of periastron of the planetary orbit to accurately
interpret the measured planetary radial velocity during the transit. Methods:
We calculate the radial velocity of a transiting planet in an eccentric orbit.
Given the larger orbital speed of planets with respect to their stellar
companions even small eccentricities can result in detectable blue or redshift
radial velocity offsets during the transit with respect to the systemic
velocity, the exact value depending also on the longitude of the periastron of
the planetary orbit. For an hot-jupiter planet, an eccentricity of only e=0.01
can produce a radial velocity offset of the order of the km/s. Conclusions: We
propose an alternative interpretation of the recently claimed radial velocity
blueshift (~2 km/s) of the planetary spectral lines of HD209458b which implies
that the orbit of this system is not exactly circular. In this case, the
longitude of the periastron of the stellar orbit is most likely confined in the
first quadrant (and that one of the planet in the third quadrant). We highlight
that transmission spectroscopy allows not only to study the compositional
properties of planetary atmospheres, but also to refine their orbital
parameters and that any conclusion regarding the presence of windflows on
planetary surfaces coming from transmission spectroscopy measurements requires
precise known orbital parameters from RV.

"Title:
The faint stellar halos of massive red galaxies from stacks of more than  42000 SDSS LRG images","
Abstract: We study the properties of massive galaxies at an average redshift of z~0.34
through stacking more than 42000 images of Luminous Red Galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. This is the largest dataset ever used for such an analysis
and it allows us to explore the outskirts of massive red galaxies at
unprecedented physical scales. Our image stacks extend farther than 400 kpc,
where the r-band profile surface brightness reaches 30 mag arcsec-2. This
analysis confirms that the stellar bodies of luminous red galaxies follow a
simple Sersic profile out to 100 kpc. At larger radii the profiles deviate from
the best-fit Sersic models and exhibit extra light in the g, r, i and z-band
stacks. This excess light can probably be attributed to unresolved intragroup
or intracluster light or a change in the light profile itself. We further show
that standard analyses of SDSS-depth images typically miss 20% of the total
stellar light and underestimate the size of LRGs by 10% compared to our best
fit r-band Sersic model of n=5.5 and r_e=13.1 kpc. If the excess light at r>100
kpc is considered to be part of the galaxy, the best fit r-band Sersic
parameters are n=5.8 and r_e=13.6 kpc. In addition we study the radially
dependent stack ellipticity and find an increase with radius from e=0.25 at
r=10 kpc to e=0.3 at r=100 kpc. This provides support that the stellar light
that we trace out to at least 100 kpc is physically associated with the
galaxies themselves and may confirm that the halos of individual LRGs have
higher ellipticities than their central parts. Lastly we show that the
broadband color gradients of the stacked images are flat beyond roughly 40 kpc,
suggesting that the stellar populations do not vary significantly with radius
in the outer parts of massive ellipticals.

The Ubiquity and Dual Nature of Ultra Compact Dwarfs","
Abstract: We present the discovery of several Ultra Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) located in
field/group environments. Examination of these objects, plus literature
objects, confirms the existence of two distinct formation channels for UCDs. We
find that the UCDs we have discovered around the group elliptical NGC3923 (and
UCDs generally) have properties consistent with their being the most luminous
members of the host galaxy's globular cluster (GC) system. We describe UCDs of
this type as giant GCs (GGCs). In contrast, the UCD we have found associated
with the isolated S0 NGC4546 is clearly the result of the stripping of a
nucleated companion galaxy. The young age (~3.4 Gyr) of the UCD, the lack of a
correspondingly young GC population, the apparently short dynamical friction
decay timescale (~0.5 Gyr) of the UCD, and the presence of a counterrotating
gas disc in the host galaxy (co-rotating with the UCD) together suggest that
this UCD is the liberated nucleus remaining after the recent stripping of a
companion by NGC4546. We suggest a general scheme that unifies the formation of
GCs, UCDs, and galaxy nuclei. In this picture ""normal"" GCs are a composite
population, composed of GCs formed in situ, GCs acquired from accreted
galaxies, and a population of lower mass stripped dwarf nuclei masquerading as
GCs. Above a ""scaling onset mass"" of 2x10^6 Msun (Mv ~ -10), UCDs emerge
together with a mass-size relation and a likely mass-metallicity relation (the
""blue tilt""). In the mass range up to 7x10^7 Msun (Mv ~ -13) UCDs comprise a
composite population of GGCs and stripped nuclei. Above 7x10^7 Msun, UCDs must
be almost exclusively stripped nuclei, as no sufficiently rich GC systems exist

"Title:
Stellar black holes at the dawn of the universe","
Abstract: It is well established that between 380000 and 1 billion years after the Big
Bang the Inter Galactic Medium (IGM) underwent a ""phase transformation"" from
cold and fully neutral to warm (~10^4 K) and ionized. Whether this phase
transformation was fully driven and completed by photoionization by young hot
stars is a question of topical interest in cosmology. AIMS. We propose here
that besides the ultraviolet radiation from massive stars, feedback from
accreting black holes in high-mass X-ray binaries (BH-HMXBs) was an additional,
important source of heating and reionization of the IGM in regions of low gas
density at large distances from star-forming galaxies. METHODS. We use current
theoretical models on the formation and evolution of primitive massive stars of
low metallicity, and the observations of compact stellar remnants in the near
and distant universe, to infer that a significant fraction of the first
generations of massive stars end up as BH-HMXBs. The total number of energetic
ionizing photons from an accreting stellar black hole in an HMXB is comparable
to the total number of ionizing photons of its progenitor star. However, the
X-ray photons emitted by the accreting black hole are capable of producing
several secondary ionizations and the ionizing power of the resulting black
hole could be greater than that of its progenitor. Feedback by the large
populations of BH-HMXBs heats the IGM to temperatures of ~10^4 K and maintains
it ionized on large distance scales. BH-HMXBs determine the early thermal
history of the universe and mantain it as ionized over large volumes of space
in regions of low density. This has a direct impact on the properties of the
faintest galaxies at high redshifts, the smallest dwarf galaxies in the local
universe, and on the existing and future surveys at radio wavelengths of atomic
hydrogen in the early universe.

Modified Gravity Makes Galaxies Brighter","
Abstract: We investigate the effect of modifed gravity with screening mechanisms, such

ephemeral than their screened doppelgangers. By embedding these stars into
dwarf galaxies, which can be unscreened for values of the parameters not yet
ruled out observationally, we show that the cumulative effect of their

this enhancement and find that it can be considerable given model parameters

between screened dwarf galaxies in clusters and unscreened galaxies in voids,
these effects could form the basis of an independent observational test that
can potentially lower the current experimental bounds on the model independent
parameters of these theories by and order of magnitude or more.

Abstract: We present Kepler satellite photometry of KIC 10661783, a short-period binary
star system which shows total eclipses and multi-periodic delta Scuti
pulsations. A frequency analysis of the eclipse-subtracted light curve reveals
at least 68 frequencies of which 55 or more can be attributed to pulsation
modes. The main limitation on this analysis is the frequency resolution within
the 27-day short-cadence light curve. Most of the variability signal lies in
the frequency range 18 to 31 c/d, with amplitudes between 0.1 and 4 mmag. One
harmonic term (2.f) and a few combination frequencies (f_i+f_j) have been
detected. From a plot of the residuals versus orbital phase we assign the
pulsations to the primary star in the system. The pulsations were removed from
the short-cadence data and the light curve was modelled using the
Wilson-Devinney code. We are unable to get a perfect fit due to the residual
effects of pulsations and also to the treatment of reflection and reprocessing
in the light curve model. A model where the secondary star fills its Roche lobe
is favoured, which means that KIC 10661783 can be classified as an oEA system.
Further photometric and spectroscopic observations will allow the masses and
radii of the two stars to be measured to high precision and hundreds of delta
Scuti pulsation frequencies to be resolved. This could lead to unique
constraints on theoretical models of delta Scuti stars, if the evolutionary

Carina Complex Project (CCCP) in conjunction with infrared (IR) photometry from
the Two Micron All-Sky Survey and the Spitzer Space Telescope Vela--Carina

provides strong constraints on the luminosities of OB stars, assuming that
their association with the Carina Nebula, and hence their distance, is
confirmed. We fit model stellar atmospheres to the optical (UBV) and IR
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 182 OB stars with known spectral types
and measure the bolometric luminosity and extinction for each star. We find
that the extinction law measured toward the OB stars has two components:
Av=1--1.5 mag produced by foreground dust with a ratio of total-to-selective
absorption Rv=3.1 plus a contribution from local dust with Rv>4.0 in the Carina
molecular clouds that increases as Av increases. Using X-ray emission as a
strong indicator of association with Carina, we identify 94 candidate OB stars
with Lbol\geq10^4 Lsun by fitting their IR SEDs. If the candidate OB stars are
eventually confirmed by follow-up spectroscopic observations, the number of
cataloged OB stars in the Carina Nebula will increase by ~50%. Correcting for
incompleteness due to OB stars falling below the Lbol cutoff or the CCCP
detection limit, these results potentially double the size of the young massive

Terzan 5 transient IGR J17480-2446: variation of burst and spectral  properties with spectral states","
Abstract: We study the spectral state evolution of the Terzan 5 transient neutron star
low-mass X-ray binary IGR J17480-2446, and how the best-fit spectral parameters
and burst properties evolved with these states, using the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer data. As reported by other authors, this is the second source which
showed transitions between atoll state and `Z' state. We find large scale
hysteresis in the almost `C'-like hardness-intensity track of the source in the
atoll state. This discovery is likely to provide a missing piece of the jigsaw
puzzle involving various types of hardness-intensity tracks from `q'-shaped for
Aquila X-1, 4U 1608-52, and many black holes to `C'-shaped for many atoll
sources. Furthermore, the regular pulsations, a diagonal transition between
soft and hard states, and the large scale hysteresis observed from IGR
J17480-2446 argue against some of the previous suggestions involving magnetic
field about atolls and millisecond pulsars. Our results also suggest that the
nature of spectral evolution throughout an outburst does not, at least
entirely, depend on the peak luminosity of the outburst. Besides, the source
took at least a month to trace the softer banana state, as opposed to a few
hours to a day, which is typical for an atoll source. In addition, while the
soft colour usually increases with intensity in the softer portion of an atoll
source, IGR J17480-2446 showed an opposite behaviour. From the detailed
spectral fitting we conclude that a blackbody+powerlaw model is the simplest
one, which describes the source continuum spectra well throughout the outburst.
We find that these two spectral components were plausibly connected with each
other, and they worked together to cause the source state evolution.

Orbits of nearby planetary nebulae and their interaction with the  interstellar medium","
Abstract: We present and analyze the orbits of eight nearby planetary nebulae (PNs)
using two different Galactic models. The errors of the derived orbital
parameters are determined with a Monte Carlo method. Based on the derived
orbital parameters, we find that Sh 2-216, DeHt 5, NGC 7293, A21, and Ton 320
belong to the thin-disk population, and PG 1034+001 and A31 belong to the
thick-disk population. PuWe 1 probably belongs to the thick-disk population,
but its population classification is very uncertain due to the large errors of
its derived orbital parameters. The PN-ISM interactions are observed for the
eight PNs in our sample. The position angles of the proper motions of the PNs
are consistent with the directions of the PN-ISM interaction regions. The
kinematic ages of PNs are much smaller than the time for them to cross the
Galactic plane. Using the models of Borkowski et al. and Soker et al., the
PN-ISM interaction can be used to derive the local density of ISM in the
vicinity of evolved PNs. According to the three-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations of Wareing et al. (WZO), Sh 2-216, A21, and Ton 320 are in the WZO
3 stage, PG 1034+001 and NGC 7293 are in the WZO 1 stage, and PuWe 1 is in the

"Title:
Surviving infant mortality in the hierarchical merging scenario","
Abstract: We examine the effects of gas expulsion on initially sub-structured and
out-of-equilibrium star clusters. We perform $N$-body simulations of the
evolution of star clusters in a static background potential before removing
that potential to model gas expulsion. We find that the initial star formation
efficiency is not a good measure of the survivability of star clusters. This is
because the stellar distribution can change significantly, causing a large
change in the relative importance of the stellar and gas potentials. We find
that the initial stellar distribution and velocity dispersion are far more
important parameters than the initial star formation efficiency, and that
clusters with very low star formation efficiencies can survive gas expulsion.
We suggest that it is variations in cluster initial conditions rather than in
their star formation efficiencies that cause some clusters to be destroyed
while a few survive.

"Title:
Pulsational instability of yellow hypergiants","
Abstract: Instability of population I (X=0.7, Y=0.02) massive stars against radial
oscillations during the post-main sequence gravitational contraction of the
helium core is investigated. Initial stellar masses are in the range from
65M_\odot to 90M_\odot. In hydrodynamic computations of self-exciting stellar
oscillations we assumed that energy transfer in the envelope of the pulsating
star is due to radiative heat conduction and convection. The convective heat
transfer was treated in the framework of the theory of time-dependent turbulent
convection. During evolutionary expansion of outer layers after hydrogen
exhaustion in the stellar core the star is shown to be unstable against radial
oscillations while its effective temperature is Teff > 6700K for
Mzams=65M_\odot and Teff > 7200K for mzams=90M_\odot. Pulsational instability
is due to the \kappa-mechanism in helium ionization zones and at lower
effective temperature oscillations decay because of significantly increasing
convection. The upper limit of the period of radial pulsations on this stage of
evolution does not exceed 200 day. Radial oscillations of the hypergiant resume
during evolutionary contraction of outer layers when the effective temperature
is Teff > 7300K for Mzams=65M_\odot and Teff > 7600K for Mzams=90M_\odot.
Initially radial oscillations are due to instability of the first overtone and
transition to fundamental mode pulsations takes place at higher effective
temperatures (Teff > 7700K for Mzams=65M_\odot and Teff > 8200K for
Mzams=90M_\odot). The upper limit of the period of radial oscillations of
evolving blueward yellow hypergiants does not exceed 130 day. Thus, yellow
hypergiants are stable against radial stellar pulsations during the major part
of their evolutionary stage.

Times, environments and channels of bulge formation in a LambdaCDM  cosmology","
Abstract: We analyze predictions from two independently developed galaxy formation
models to study the mechanisms, environments, and characteristic times of bulge
formation in a LambdaCDM cosmogony. For each model, we test different
prescriptions for bulge formation in order to quantify the relative importance
of different channels. Our results show that the strong correlation between
galaxy and halo mass for central galaxies, and the richer merger history of
more massive systems naturally give rise to a strong correlation between galaxy
mass and morphology, and between halo mass and morphological type of central
galaxies. Large fractions of the bulge mass are acquired through major and
minor mergers, but disc instability plays an important role, particularly for
intermediate mass galaxies. We find that the modelling of disc instability
events, as well as of the galaxy merger times, can affect significantly the
timing of bulge formation, and the relative importance of different channels.
Bulge dominated galaxies acquire their morphology through major mergers, but
this can be modified by cooling of gas from the surrounding hot halo. We find
that disc regrowth is a non negligible component of the evolution of bulge
dominated galaxies, particularly for low to intermediate masses, and at high
redshifts.

The Origin of (90) Antiope From Component-Resolved Near-Infrared  Spectroscopy","
Abstract: The origin of the similary-sized binary asteroid (90) Antiope remains an
unsolved puzzle. To constrain the origin of this unique double system, we
recorded individual spectra of the components using SPIFFI, a near-infrared
integral field spectrograph fed by SINFONI, an adaptive optics module available
on VLT-UT4. Using our previously published orbital model, we requested
telescope time when the separation of the components of (90) Antiope was larger
than 0.087"", to minimize the contamination between components, during the
February 2009 opposition. Several multi-spectral data-cubes in J band (SNR=40)
and H+K band (SNR=100) were recorded in three epochs and revealed the two
components of (90) Antiope. After developing a specific photometric extraction
method and running an error analysis by Monte-Carlo simulations, we
successfully extracted reliable spectra of both components from 1.1 to 2.4 um
taken on the night of February 21, 2009. These spectra do not display any
significant absorption features due to mafic mineral, ices, or organics, and
their slopes are in agreement with both components being C- or Cb- type
asteroids. Their constant flux ratio indicates that both components' surface
reflectances are quite similar, with a 1-sigma variation of 7%. By comparison
with 2MASS J, H, K color distribution of observed Themis family members, we
conclude that both bodies were most likely formed at the same time and from the
same material. The similarly-sized system could indeed be the result of the
breakup of a rubble-pile proto-Antiope into two equal-sized bodies, but other
scenarios of formation implying a common origin should also be considered.

Rotating Massive Main-Sequence Stars I: Grids of Evolutionary Models and  Isochrones","
Abstract: We present a dense grid of evolutionary tracks and isochrones of rotating
massive main-sequence stars. We provide three grids with different initial
compositions tailored to compare with early OB stars in the Small and Large
Magellanic Clouds and in the Galaxy. Each grid covers masses ranging from 5 to
60 Msun and initial rotation rates between 0 and about 600 km/s. To calibrate
our models we used the results of the VLT-FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars. We
determine the amount of convective overshooting by using the observed drop in
rotation rates for stars with surface gravities log g < 3.2 to determine the
width of the main sequence. We calibrate the efficiency of rotationally induced
mixing using the nitrogen abundance determinations for B stars in the Large
Magellanic cloud. We describe and provide evolutionary tracks and the evolution
of the central and surface abundances. In particular, we discuss the occurrence
of quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution, i.e. the severe effects of efficient
mixing of the stellar interior found for the most massive fast rotators. We
provide a detailed set of isochrones for rotating stars. Rotation as an initial
parameter leads to a degeneracy between the age and the mass of massive main
sequence stars if determined from its observed location in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We show that the consideration of surface
abundances can resolve this degeneracy.

"Title:
On the Formation of Double White Dwarfs through Stable Mass Transfer and  a Common Envelope","
Abstract: Although several dozen double white dwarfs (DWDs) have been observed, for
many the exact nature of the evolutionary channel(s) by which they form remains
uncertain. The canonical explanation calls for the progenitor binary system to
undergo two subsequent mass-transfer events, both of which are unstable and
lead to a common envelope (CE). However, it has been shown that if both CE
events obey the standard alpha-prescription (parametrizing energy loss), it is
not possible to reproduce all of the observed systems. The gamma-prescription
was proposed as an alternative to this description, instead parametrizing the
fraction of angular momentum carried away in dynamical-timescale mass loss. In
this paper, we analyze simultaneous energy and angular-momentum conservation,
and show that the gamma-prescription cannot adequately describe a CE event for
an arbitrary binary, nor can the first phase of mass loss always be understood
in general as a dynamical-timescale event. We consider in detail the first
episode of mass transfer in binary systems with initially low companion masses,
with a primary mass in the range 1.0--1.3 solar masses and an initial mass
ratio between the secondary and primary stars of 0.83--0.92. In these systems,
the first episode of dramatic mass loss may be stable, non-conservative mass
transfer. This strips the donor's envelope and dramatically raises the mass
ratio; the considered progenitor binary systems can then evolve into DWDs after
passing through a single CE during the second episode of mass loss. We find
that such a mechanism reproduces the properties of the observed DWD systems
which have an older component with less than approximately 0.46 solar masses
and mass ratios between the younger and older WDs greater than 1.

A Planet of an A-Star: HD15082b","
Abstract: Most of the known transiting extrasolar planets orbit slowly rotating F, G or
K stars. In here we report on the detection of a transiting planet orbiting the
bright, rapidly rotating A5 star HD15082 (WASP-33b, V=8.3, m sin i = 86 km

taken during transit show a hump caused by the planet crossing the line
profile. From the analysis of the spectra, we derive the radius of the planet
and find that it is orbiting retrograde in respect to the spin of the star.
Because of its small distance from an A5 star (the orbital period of only 1.22
days), the equilibrium temperature of the planet is estimated to be 2700 K. The
planet thus is one of the hottest planets known, which makes it relatively easy
to detect it in the IR. We thus tried to detect it using the TNG but did not
succeed.

Detection of continuum radio emission associated with Geminga","
Abstract: A deep Very Large Array observation of the Geminga pulsar field led to the

trailing the neutron star proper motion. This 10-arcsec-long radio feature,
detected with a flux of 0.4 mJy at 4.8 GHz, is marginally displaced (2.7\pm1.8
arcsec) from the pulsar (which, at any rate, is unlikely to contribute with
magnetospheric pulsed emission more than 15% to the total observed radio
luminosity, about 1E26 erg/s) and positionally coincident with the X-ray axial
tail recently discovered by Chandra and ascribed to the pulsar wind nebula

synchrotron-emitting PWN, but the present data do not allow us to discriminate
between different (and not always necessarily mutually exclusive) possible
processes for producing that. If this radio feature does not result from
intrinsic peculiarities of Geminga, but its proximity and radio-quiet nature
(both helping in not hindering the faint diffuse radio emission), other
relatively near and energetic radio-quiet pulsars could show similar structures
in dedicated interferometric observations.

The Transitional Protoplanetary Disk Frequency as a Function of Age:  Disk Evolution in the Coronet Cluster, Taurus, and Other 1--8 Myr-old Regions","
Abstract: We present Spitzer 3.6--24 micron photometry and spectroscopy for stars in
the 1--3 Myr-old Coronet Cluster, expanding upon the survey of Sicilia-Aguilar
et al. (2008). Using sophisticated radiative transfer models, we analyze these
new data and those from Sicilia-Aguilar et al. (2008) to identify disks with
evidence for substantial dust evolution consistent with disk clearing:
transitional disks. We then analyze data in Taurus and others young clusters --
IC 348, NGC 2362, and eta Cha -- to constrain the transitional disk frequency
as a function of time. Our analysis confirms previous results finding evidence
for two types of transitional disks -- those with inner holes and those that
are homologously depleted. The percentage of disks in the transitional phase
increases from ~ 15--20% at 1--2 Myr to > 50% at 5--8 Myr; the mean
transitional disk lifetime is closer to ~ 1 Myr than 0.1--0.5 Myr, consistent
with previous studies by Currie et al. (2009) and Sicilia-Aguilar et al.
(2009). In the Coronet Cluster and IC 348, transitional disks are more numerous
for very low-mass M3--M6 stars than for more massive K5--M2 stars, while Taurus
lacks a strong spectral type-dependent frequency. Assuming standard values for
the gas-to-dust ratio and other disk properties, the lower limit for the masses
of optically-thick primordial disks is Mdisk ~ 0.001--0.003 M*. We find that
single color-color diagrams do not by themselves uniquely identify transitional
disks or primordial disks. Full SED modeling is required to accurately assess
disk evolution for individual sources and inform statistical estimates of the
transitional disk population in large samples using mid-IR colors.

Regular and chaotic orbits in barred galaxies - I. Applying the  SALI/GALI method to explore their distribution in several models","
Abstract: The distinction between chaotic and regular behavior of orbits in galactic
models is an important issue and can help our understanding of galactic
dynamical evolution. In this paper, we deal with this issue by applying the
techniques of the Smaller (and Generalized) ALingment Indices, SALI (and GALI),
to extensive samples of orbits obtained by integrating numerically the
equations of motion in a barred galaxy potential. We estimate first the
fraction of chaotic and regular orbits for the two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) case
(where the galaxy extends only in the (x,y)-space) and show that it is a
non-monotonic function of the energy. For the three DOF extension of this model
(in the z-direction), we give similar estimates, both by exploring different
sets of initial conditions and by varying the model parameters, like the mass,
size and pattern speed of the bar. We find that regular motion is more abundant
at small radial distances from the center of the galaxy, where the relative
non-axisymmetric forcing is relatively weak, and at small distances from the
equatorial plane, where trapping around the stable periodic orbits is
important. We also find that the variation of the bar pattern speed, within a
realistic range of values, does not affect much the phase space's fraction of
regular and chaotic motions. Using different sets of initial conditions, we
show that chaotic motion is dominant in galaxy models whose bar component is
more massive, while models with a fatter or thicker bar present generally more
regular behavior. Finally, we find that the fraction of orbits that are chaotic
correlates strongly with the bar strength.

A Bayesian approach to comparing theoretic models to observational data:  A case study from solar flare physics","
Abstract: Solar flares are large-scale releases of energy in the solar atmosphere,
which are characterised by rapid changes in the hydrodynamic properties of
plasma from the photosphere to the corona. Solar physicists have typically
attempted to understand these complex events using a combination of theoretical
models and observational data. From a statistical perspective, there are many
challenges associated with making accurate and statistically significant
comparisons between theory and observations, due primarily to the large number
of free parameters associated with physical models. This class of ill-posed
statistical problem is ideally suited to Bayesian methods. In this paper, the
solar flare studied by Raftery et al. (2009) is reanalysed using a Bayesian
framework. This enables us to study the evolution of the flare's temperature,
emission measure and energy loss in a statistically self-consistent manner. The
Bayesian-based model selection techniques imply that no decision can be made
regarding which of the conductive or non-thermal beam heating play the most
important role in heating the flare plasma during the impulsive phase of this
event.

Modeling the Dispersal of an Active Region: Quantifying Energy Input  into the Corona","
Abstract: In this paper a new technique for modeling non-linear force-free fields
directly from line of sight magnetogram observations is presented. The
technique uses sequences of magnetograms directly as lower boundary conditions
to drive the evolution of coronal magnetic fields between successive force-free
equilibria over long periods of time. It is illustrated by applying it to MDI
observations of a decaying active region, NOAA AR 8005. The active region is
modeled during a 4 day period around its central meridian passage. Over this
time, the dispersal of the active region is dominated by random motions due to
small scale convective cells. Through studying the build up of magnetic energy
in the model, it is found that such small scale motions may inject anywhere
from $2.5-3 \times 10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$ of free magnetic energy into the
coronal field. Most of this energy is stored within the center of the active
region in the low corona, below 30 Mm. After 4 days the build-up of free energy
is 10% that of the corresponding potential field. This energy buildup, is
sufficient to explain the radiative losses at coronal temperatures within the
active region. Small scale convective motions therefore play an integral part
in the energy balance of the corona. This new technique has wide ranging
applications with the new high resolution, high cadence observations from the
SDO:HMI and SDO:AIA instruments.

Dynamo in the Intra-Cluster Medium: Simulation of CGL-MHD Turbulent  Dynamo","
Abstract: The standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description of the plasma in the hot,
magnetized gas of the intra-cluster (ICM) medium is not adequate because it is
weakly collisional. In such collisionless magnetized gas, the microscopic
velocity distribution of the particles is not isotropic, giving rise to kinetic
effects on the dynamical scales. These kinetic effects could be important in
understanding the turbulence, as so as the amplification and maintenance of the
magnetic fields in the ICM. It is possible to formulate fluid models for
collisonless or weakly collisional gas by introducing modifications in the MHD
equations. These models are often referred as kinetic MHD (KMHD). Using a KMHD
model based on the CGL-closure, which allows the adiabatic evolution of the two
components of the pressure tensor (the parallel and perpendicular components
with respect to the local magnetic field), we performed 3D numerical
simulations of forced turbulence in order to study the amplification of an
initially weak seed magnetic field. We found that the growth rate of the
magnetic energy is comparable to that of the ordinary MHD turbulent dynamo, but
the magnetic energy saturates in a level smaller than of the MHD case. We also
found that a necessary condition for the dynamo works is to impose limits to
the anisotropy of the pressure.

Designing a cross-correlation search for continuous-wave gravitational  radiation from a neutron star in the supernova remnant SNR 1987A","
Abstract: A strategy is devised for a semi-coherent cross-correlation search for a
young neutron star in the supernova remnant SNR 1987A, using science data from
the Initial LIGO and/or Virgo detectors. An astrophysical model for the
gravitational wave phase is introduced which describes the star's spin down in
terms of its magnetic field strength $B$ and ellipticity $\epsilon$, instead of
its frequency derivatives. The model accurately tracks the gravitational wave
phase from a rapidly decelerating neutron star under the restrictive but
computationally unavoidable assumption of constant braking index, an issue
which has hindered previous searches for such young objects. The theoretical
sensitivity is calculated and compared to the indirect, age-based wave strain
upper limit. The age-based limit lies above the detection threshold in the
frequency band 75\,Hz $\lesssim \nu \lesssim 450$\,Hz. The semi-coherent phase
metric is also calculated and used to estimate the optimal search template
spacing for the search. The range of search parameters that can be covered
given our computational resources ($\sim 10^9$ templates) is also estimated.
For Initial LIGO sensitivity, in the frequency band between 50\,Hz and 500\,Hz,
in the absence of a detected signal, we should be able to set limits of $B
\gtrsim 10^{11}$\,G and $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-4}$.

compare it with observations from six galaxy catalogues (NVSS, HEAO, 2MASS, and
SDSS main galaxies, luminous red galaxies, and quasars). We sample the value of
the speed of sound and perform a likelihood analysis, finding that the UDM
model is as likely as the LambdaCDM, and is compatible with observations for a
range of values of c_\infinity (the value of the sound speed at late times) on
which structure formation depends. In particular, we obtain an upper bound of
c_\infinity^2 \leq 0.009 at 95% confidence level, meaning that the LambdaCDM
model, for which c_\infinity^2 = 0, is a good fit to the data, while the
posterior probability distribution peaks at the value c_\infinity^2=10^(-4) .
Finally, we study the time dependence of the deviation from LambdaCDM via a
tomographic analysis using a mock redshift distribution and we find that the
largest deviation is for low-redshift sources, suggesting that future low-z
surveys will be best suited to constrain UDM models.

Abstract: In order to examine if the next generation space VLBI,such as VSOP-2 (VLBI

intensity profile around the black hole caused by rapid disk rotation, as long
as the electron temperature does not steeply rises towards the black hole, as
was predicted by the accretion disk theory and the three dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Further, we can detect a deficit in the
observed intensity around the black hole when the apparent size of the
gravitational radius is larger than $\gtrsim 1.5 \mu$ arcseconds. In the cases
that the inner edge of the disk is located at the radius of the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO), moreover, even the black hole spin will be
measured. We also estimate the required signal-to-noise ratio $\mathcal{R}_{\rm
SN}$ for achieving the scientific goals mentioned above, finding that it should
be at least 10 at 22 GHz. To conclude, direct mapping observations by the next

The Relation between Black Hole Mass and Host Spheroid Stellar Mass out  to z~2","
Abstract: We combine Hubble Space Telescope images from the Great Observatories Origins
Deep Survey with archival Very Large Telescope and Keck spectra of a sample of
11 X-ray selected broad-line active galactic nuclei in the redshift range 1<z<2
to study the black hole mass - stellar mass relation out to a lookback time of
10 Gyrs. Stellar masses of the spheroidal component are derived from
multi-filter surface photometry. Black hole masses are estimated from the width
of the broad MgII emission line and the 3000A nuclear luminosity. Comparing
with a uniformly measured local sample and taking into account selection
effects, we find evolution in the form M_BH/M_spheroid ~ (1+z)^(1.96+/-0.55),
in agreement with our earlier studies based on spheroid luminosity. However,
this result is more accurate because it does not require a correction for
luminosity evolution and therefore avoids the related and dominant systematic
uncertainty. We also measure total stellar masses. Combining our sample with
data from the literature, we find M_BH/M_host ~ (1+z)^(1.15+/-0.15), consistent
with the hypothesis that black holes (in the range M_BH ~ 10^8-9 M_sun) predate
the formation of their host galaxies. Roughly one third of our objects reside
in spiral galaxies; none of the host galaxies reveal signs of interaction or
major merger activity. Combined with the slower evolution in host stellar
masses compared to spheroid stellar masses, our results indicate that secular
evolution or minor mergers play a non-negligible role in growing both BHs and
spheroids.

"Title:
Steady state reconnection at a single 3D magnetic null point","
Abstract: To systematically stress a rotationally symmetric 3D magnetic null point by
advecting the opposite footpoints of the spine axis in opposite directions.
This stress eventually concentrates in the vicinity of the null point forming a
local current sheet through which magnetic reconnection takes place. The aim is
to look for a steady state evolution of the current sheet dynamics which may
provide scaling relations for various characteristic parameters of the system.
The evolution is followed by solving numerically the non-ideal MHD equations in
a Cartesian domain. The null point is embedded in an initially constant density
and temperature plasma. It is shown that a quasi-steady reconnection process
can be set up at a 3D null by continuous shear driving. It appears that a true
steady state in unlikely to be realised as the current layer tends to grow
until restricted by the geometry of the computational domain and imposed
driving profile. However, ratios between characteristic quantities clearly
settle after some time to stable values -- so that the evolution is
quasi-steady. The experiments show a number of scaling relations, but they do
not provide a clear consensus for extending to lower magnetic resistivity or
faster driving velocities. More investigations are needed to fully clarify the
properties of current sheets at magnetic null points.

"Title:
The GeV-TeV Galactic gamma-ray diffuse emission I. Uncertainties in the  predictions of the hadronic component","
Abstract: The Galactic gamma-ray diffuse emission is currently observed in the GeV-TeV
energy range with unprecedented accuracy by the Fermi satellite. Understanding
this component is crucial as it provides a background to many different signals
such as extragalactic sources or annihilating dark matter. It is timely to
reinvestigate how it is calculated and to assess the various uncertainties
which are likely to affect the accuracy of the predictions. The Galactic
gamma-ray diffuse emission is mostly produced above a few GeV by the
interactions of cosmic ray primaries impinging on the interstellar material.
The theoretical error on that component is derived by exploring various
potential sources of uncertainty. Particular attention is paid to cosmic ray
propagation. Nuclear cross sections, the proton and helium fluxes at the Earth,
the Galactic radial profile of supernova remnants and the hydrogen distribution
can also severely affect the signal. The propagation of cosmic ray species
throughout the Galaxy is described in the framework of a semi-analytic two-zone
diffusion/convection model. This allows to convert the constraints set by the
boron-to-carbon data into a theoretical uncertainty on the diffuse emission.
New deconvolutions of the HI and CO sky maps are also used to get the hydrogen
distribution within the Galaxy. The thickness of the cosmic ray diffusive halo
is found to have a significant effect on the Galactic gamma-ray diffuse
emission while the interplay between diffusion and convection has little
influence on the signal. The uncertainties related to nuclear cross sections
and to the primary cosmic ray fluxes at the Earth are significant. The radial
distribution of supernova remnants along the Galactic plane turns out to be a
key ingredient. As expected, the predictions are extremely sensitive to the
spatial distribution of hydrogen within the Milky Way.

The Physical Conditions of a Lensed Star-forming Galaxy at z=1.7","
Abstract: We report rest-frame optical Keck/NIRSPEC spectroscopy of the bright lensed
galaxy RCSGA 032727-132609 at z=1.7037. From precise measurements of the

temperature, oxygen abundance, and N/O, Ne/O, and Ar/O abundance ratios. The

empirically-calibrated diagnostics in situ. Finally, we explore the positions
of lensed and unlensed galaxies in standard diagnostic diagrams, and explore
the diversity of ionization conditions and mass--metallicity ratios at z=2.

A weak lensing analysis of the Abell 383 cluster","
Abstract: In this paper we use deep CFHT and SUBARU $uBVRIz$ archival images of the
Abell 383 cluster (z=0.187) to estimate its mass by weak lensing. To this end,
we first use simulated images to check the accuracy provided by our KSB
pipeline. Such simulations include both the STEP 1 and 2 simulations, and more
realistic simulations of the distortion of galaxy shapes by a cluster with a
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. From such simulations we estimate the effect
of noise on shear measurement and derive the correction terms. The R-band image
is used to derive the mass by fitting the observed tangential shear profile
with a NFW mass profile. Photometric redshifts are computed from the uBVRIz
catalogs. Different methods for the foreground/background galaxy selection are
implemented, namely selection by magnitude, color and photometric redshifts,
and results are compared. In particular, we developed a semi-automatic
algorithm to select the foreground galaxies in the color-color diagram, based
on observed colors. Using color selection or photometric redshifts improves the
correction of dilution from foreground galaxies: this leads to higher signals
in the inner parts of the cluster. We obtain a cluster mass that is ~ 20%
higher than previous estimates, and is more consistent the mass expected from
X--ray data. The R-band luminosity function of the cluster is finally computed.

"Title:
Period doubling bifurcation and high-order resonances in RR Lyrae  hydrodynamical models","
Abstract: We investigated period doubling, a well-known phenomenon in dynamical
systems, for the first time in RR Lyrae models. These studies provide
theoretical background for the recent discovery of period doubling in some
Blazhko RR Lyrae stars with the Kepler space telescope. Since period doubling
was observed only in Blazhko-modulated stars so far, the phenomenon can help in
the understanding of the modulation as well. Utilising the Florida-Budapest
turbulent convective hydrodynamical code, we identified the phenomenon in
radiative and convective models as well. A period-doubling cascade was also
followed up to an eight-period solution confirming that the destabilisation of
the limit cycle is indeed the underlying phenomenon. Floquet stability roots
were calculated to investigate the possible causes and occurrences of the
phenomenon. A two-dimensional diagnostic diagram was constructed to display the
various resonances between the fundamental mode and the different overtones.
Combining the two tools, we confirmed that the period-doubling instability is
caused by a 9:2 resonance between the 9th overtone and the fundamental mode.
Destabilisation of the limit cycle by a resonance of a high-order mode is
possible because the overtone is a strange mode. The resonance is found to be
sufficiently strong enough to shift the period of overtone with up to 10
percent. Our investigations suggest that a more complex interplay of radial
(and presumably non-radial) modes could happen in RR Lyrae stars that might
have connections with the Blazhko effect as well.

"Title:
Re-acceleration of Nonthermal Particles at Weak Cosmological Shock Waves","
Abstract: We examine diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of the pre-exisiting as well as
freshly injected populations of nonthermal, cosmic-ray (CR) particles at weak
cosmological shocks. Assuming simple models for thermal leakage injection and
Alfv\'enic drift, we derive analytic, time-dependent solutions for the two
populations of CRs accelerated in the test-particle regime. We then compare
them with the results from kinetic DSA simulations for shock waves that are
expected to form in intracluster media and cluster outskirts in the course of
large-scale structure formation. We show that the test-particle solutions
provide a good approximation for the pressure and spectrum of CRs accelerated
at these weak shocks. Since the injection is extremely inefficient at weak
shocks, the pre-existing CR population dominates over the injected population.
If the pressure due to pre-existing CR protons is about 5 % of the gas thermal
pressure in the upstream flow, the downstream CR pressure can absorb typically
a few to 10 % of the shock ram pressure at shocks with the Mach number $M \la
3$. Yet, the re-acceleration of CR electrons can result in a substantial
synchrotron emission behind the shock. The enhancement in synchrotron radiation
across the shock is estimated to be about a few to several for $M \sim 1.5$ and
$10^2-10^3$ for $M \sim 3$, depending on the detail model parameters. The
implication of our findings for observed bright radio relics is discussed.

"Title:
Locally extracting scalar, vector and tensor modes in cosmological  perturbation theory","
Abstract: Cosmological perturbation theory relies on the decomposition of perturbations
into so-called scalar, vector and tensor modes. This decomposition is non-local
and depends on unknowable boundary conditions. The non-locality is particularly
important at second- and higher-order because perturbative modes are sourced by
products of lower-oder modes, which must be integrated over all space in order
to isolate each mode. However, given a trace-free rank-2 tensor, a locally
defined scalar mode may be trivially derived by taking two divergences, which
knocks out the vector and tensor degrees of freedom. A similar local
differential operation will return a pure vector mode. This means that scalar
and vector degrees of freedom have local descriptions. The corresponding local
extraction of the tensor mode is unknown however. We give it here. The
operators we define are useful for defining gauge-invariant quantities at
second-order. We perform much of our analysis using an index-free
`vector-calculus' approach which makes manipulating tensor equations
considerably simpler.

Costs and Difficulties of Large-Scale 'Messaging', and the Need for  International Debate on Potential Risks","
Abstract: We advocate international consultations on societal and technical issues to
address the risk problem, and a moratorium on future METI transmissions until
such issues are resolved. Instead, we recommend continuing to conduct SETI by
listening, with no innate risk, while using powerful new search systems to give
a better total probability of detection of beacons and messages than METI for
the same cost, and with no need for a long obligatory wait for a response.
Realistically, beacons are costly. In light of recent work on the economics of
contact by radio, we offer alternatives to the current standard of SETI
searches. Historical leakage from Earth has been undetectable as messages for
credible receiver systems. Transmissions ('messages') to date are faint and
very unlikely to be detected, even by very nearby stars. Future space microwave
and laser power systems will likely be more visible.

"Title:
Defining the intrinsic AGN infrared spectral energy distribution and  measuring its contribution to the infrared output of composite galaxies","
Abstract: We use infrared spectroscopy and photometry to empirically define the
intrinsic, thermal infrared spectral energy distribution (i.e., 6-100 um SED)
of typical active galactic nuclei (i.e., 2-10 keV luminosity,
Lx=10^{42}-10^{44} ergs/s AGNs). On average, the infrared SED of typical AGNs
is best described as a broken power-law at <40 um that falls steeply at >40um
(i.e., at far-infrared wavelengths). Despite this fall-off at long wavelengths,
at least 3 of the 11 AGNs in our sample have observed SEDs that are
AGN-dominated even at 60 um, demonstrating the importance of accounting for
possible AGN contribution even at far-infrared wavelengths. Our results also
suggest that the average intrinsic AGN 6-100 um SED gets bluer with increasing
X-ray luminosity, a trend seen both within our sample and also when we compare
against the intrinsic SEDs of more luminous quasars (i.e., Lx>10^{44} ergs/s).
We compare our intrinsic AGN SEDs with predictions from dusty torus models and
find they are more closely matched by clumpy, rather than continuous, torus
models. Next, we use our intrinsic AGN SEDs to define a set of correction
factors to convert either monochromatic infrared or X-ray luminosities into
total intrinsic AGN infrared (i.e., 8-1000 um) luminosities. Finally, we
outline a procedure that uses our newly defined intrinsic AGN infrared SEDs, in
conjunction with a selection of host-galaxy templates, to fit the infrared
photometry of composite galaxies and measure the AGN contribution to their
total infrared output. We verify the accuracy of our SED fitting procedure by
comparing our results to two independent measures of AGN contribution. Our SED
fitting procedure opens up the possibility of measuring the intrinsic AGN
luminosities of large numbers of galaxies with well-sampled infrared data
(e.g., IRAS, ISO, Spitzer and Herschel).

"Title:
Clouds and the Faint Young Sun Paradox","
Abstract: We investigate the role which clouds could play in resolving the Faint Young
Sun Paradox (FYSP). Lower solar luminosity in the past means that less energy
was absorbed on Earth (a forcing of -50 Wm-2 during the late Archean), but
geological evidence points to the Earth being at least as warm as it is today,
with only very occasional glaciations. We perform radiative calculations on a
single global mean atmospheric column. We select a nominal set of three
layered, randomly overlapping clouds, which are both consistent with observed
cloud climatologies and reproduce the observed global mean energy budget of
Earth. By varying the fraction, thickness, height and particle size of these
clouds we conduct a wide exploration of how changed clouds could affect
climate, thus constraining how clouds could contribute to resolving the FYSP.
Low clouds reflect sunlight but have little greenhouse effect. Removing them
entirely gives a~forcing of +25 Wm-2 whilst more modest reduction in their
efficacy gives a forcing of +10 to +15 Wm-2. For high clouds, the greenhouse
effect dominates. It is possible to generate +50 Wm-2 forcing from enhancing
these, but this requires making them 3.5 times thicker and 14 K colder than the
standard high cloud in our nominal set and expanding their coverage to 100% of
the sky. Such changes are not credible. More plausible changes would generate
no more that +15 Wm-2 forcing. Thus neither fewer low clouds nor more high
clouds can provide enough forcing to resolve the FYSP. Decreased surface albedo
can contribute no more than +5 Wm-2 forcing. Some models which have been
applied to the FYSP do not include clouds at all. These overestimate the
forcing due to increased CO2 by 20 to 25% when CO2 is 0.01 to 0.1 bar.

Time Domain Simulations of Arm Locking in LISA","
Abstract: Arm locking is a technique that has been proposed for reducing laser
frequency fluctuations in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a
gravitational-wave observatory sensitive in the milliHertz frequency band. Arm
locking takes advantage of the geometric stability of the triangular
constellation of three spacecraft that comprise LISA to provide a frequency
reference with a stability in the LISA measurement band that exceeds that
available from a standard reference such as an optical cavity or molecular
absorption line. We have implemented a time-domain simulation of arm locking
including the expected limiting noise sources (shot noise, clock noise,
spacecraft jitter noise, and residual laser frequency noise). The effect of
imperfect a priori knowledge of the LISA heterodyne frequencies and the
associated 'pulling' of an arm locked laser is included. We find that our
implementation meets requirements both on the noise and dynamic range of the
laser frequency.

A robust sample of galaxies at redshifts 6.0<z<8.7: stellar populations,  star-formation rates and stellar masses","
Abstract: We present the results of a photometric redshift analysis designed to
identify z>6 galaxies from the near-IR HST imaging in three deep fields (HUDF,
HUDF09-2 & ERS). By adopting a rigorous set of criteria for rejecting low-z
interlopers, and by employing a deconfusion technique to allow the available
IRAC imaging to be included in the candidate selection process, we have derived
a robust sample of 70 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) spanning the redshift range
6.0<z<8.7. Based on our final sample we investigate the distribution of UV
spectral slopes (beta), finding a variance-weighted mean value of <beta>=-2.05
+/- 0.09 which, contrary to some previous results, is not significantly bluer
than displayed by lower-redshift starburst galaxies. We confirm the correlation
between UV luminosity and stellar mass reported elsewhere, but based on fitting
galaxy templates featuring a range of star-formation histories, metallicities
and reddening we find that, at z>=6, the range in mass-to-light ratio (M*/L_UV)
at a given UV luminosity could span a factor of ~50. Focusing on a sub-sample
of twenty-one candidates with IRAC detections at 3.6-microns we find that L*
LBGs at z~6.5 have a median stellar mass of M* = (2.1 +/- 1.1) x 10^9 Msun and
a median specific star-formation rate of 1.9 +/- 0.8 Gyr^-1. Using the same
sub-sample we have investigated the influence of nebular continuum and line
emission, finding that for the majority of candidates (16 out of 21) the
best-fitting stellar-mass estimates are reduced by less than a factor of 2.5.
Finally, a detailed comparison of our final sample with the results of previous
studies suggests that, at faint magnitudes, several high-redshift galaxy
samples in the literature are significantly contaminated by low-redshift

requirements, and (4) the flux recovery of a combined map. We generate
visibilities from the single-dish map and calculate the noise of each
visibility based on the RMS noise. Our weighting scheme, though it is applied
to discrete visibilities in this paper, is applicable to grids in uv-space, and
this scheme may advance in future software development. For a realistic amount
of observing time, the sensitivities of the NRO45 and CARMA visibility data
sets are best matched by using the single dish baselines only up to 4-6
kilo-lambda (about 1/4-1/3 of the dish diameter). The synthesized beam size is
determined to conserve the flux between synthesized beam and convolution beam.
The superior uv-coverage provided by the combination of CARMA long baseline

"Title:
Modeling the formation and evolution of star cluster populations in  galaxy simulations","
Abstract: (Abridged) The formation and evolution of star cluster populations are
related to the galactic environment. Cluster formation is governed by processes
acting on galactic scales, and star cluster disruption is driven by the tidal
field. In this paper, we present a self-consistent model for the formation and
evolution of star cluster populations, for which we combine an N-body/SPH
galaxy evolution code with semi-analytic models for star cluster evolution. The
model includes star formation, feedback, stellar evolution, and star cluster
disruption by two-body relaxation and tidal shocks. We apply the model by
simulating a suite of 9 isolated disc galaxies and 24 galaxy mergers. The
evolutionary histories of individual clusters in these simulations are
discussed to illustrate how the environment of clusters changes in time and
space. The resulting variability of the disruption rate with time and space
affects the properties of star cluster populations. The combined effect of
clusters escaping their dense formation sites (`cluster migration') and the
preferential disruption of clusters residing in dense environments (`natural
selection') implies that the mean disruption rate of the population decreases
with cluster age. This affects the slope of the cluster age distribution, which
becomes a function of the star formation rate density. The evolutionary
histories of clusters in a galaxy merger vary widely and determine which
clusters survive the merger. This impacts the age distributions and the
locations of the surviving clusters at all times during a merger. We conclude
that accounting for the interplay between the formation, disruption, and
orbital histories of clusters enables a more sophisticated interpretation of
observed properties of cluster populations, thereby extending the role of
cluster populations as tracers of galaxy evolution.

that the average molecular gas fraction has undergone strong evolution since

information about the relative depletion/replenishment of molecular fuel in

We find a majority of methanol maser morphologies to be complex with some
sources previously determined to have regular morphologies in fact being
embedded within larger structures. This suggests that some maser spots do not
have a compact core, which leads them being resolved in high angular resolution
observations. This also casts doubt on interpretations of the origin of
methanol maser emission solely based on source morphologies. We also
investigate the association of methanol masers with mid-infrared emission and
find very close correspondence between methanol masers and 24 micron point
sources. This adds further credence to theoretical models that predict methanol
masers to be pumped by warm dust emission and firmly reinforces the finding
that Class II methanol masers are unambiguous tracers of embedded high-mass

On the cooling tails of thermonuclear X-ray bursts: the IGR J17480-2446  link","
Abstract: The neutron star transient and 11 Hz X-ray pulsar IGR J17480-2446, recently
discovered in the globular cluster Terzan 5, showed unprecedented bursting
activity during its 2010 October-November outburst. We analyzed all X-ray
bursts detected with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and find strong evidence
that they all have a thermonuclear origin, despite the fact that many do not
show the canonical spectral softening along the decay imprinted on type I X-ray
bursts by the cooling of the neutron star photosphere. We show that the
persistent-to-burst power ratio is fully consistent with the
accretion-to-thermonuclear efficiency ratio along the whole outburst, as is
typical for type I X-ray bursts. The burst energy, peak luminosity and
daily-averaged spectral profiles all evolve smoothly throughout the outburst,
in parallel with the persistent (non-burst) luminosity. We also find that the
peak burst to persistent luminosity ratio determines whether or not cooling is
present in the bursts from IGR J17480-2446, and argue that the apparent lack of
cooling is due to the ""non-cooling"" bursts having both a lower peak temperature
and a higher non-burst (persistent) emission. We conclude that the detection of
cooling along the decay is a sufficient, but not a necessary condition to
identify an X-ray burst as thermonuclear. Finally, we compare these findings
with X-ray bursts from other rapidly accreting neutron stars.

"Title:
Characteristics of solar-like oscillations of clusters simulated by  stellar population synthesis","
Abstract: Using a stellar population-synthesis method, we studied the distributions of
{\nu}_max and {\Delta}{\nu} of simulated clusters with various ages and
metallicities. Except for the confirmed peak (RC peak) of {\Delta}{\nu} of
red-clump (RC) stars, i.e. core-helium burning stars, there are a gap and a
main sequence (MS) peak in the distributions of {\nu}_max and {\Delta}{\nu} of
young clusters. The gap corresponds mainly to the Hertzsprung gap phase of
evolution. The RC peak is caused by the fact that the radius of many RC stars
near the zero-age horizontal branch concentrates in a certain range. The MS
peak also results from the fact that many MS stars which are located in a
certain mass range have an approximate radius in the early phase of MS. The MS
peak barely exists in the simulated clusters with age < 1.0 Gyr. The location
of the MS peak moves to a lower frequency with increasing age or metallicity,
which may be applied to constrain the age and metallicity of young clusters.
For the simulated clusters with Z = 0.02, the frequency of the location of the
dominant RC peak increases with age when age < 1.2 Gyr, and then decreases with
age when age > 1.2 Gyr; but it scarcely varies when age > 2.4 Gyr. This is
relative to the degeneracy of the hydrogen-exhausted core at the time of helium
ignition. In addition, the RC peak is not sensitive to the metallicity,
especially for the clusters with age > 2.4 Gyr. Asteroseismical observation for
clusters with age < 2.4 Gyr may aid in testing the theory of the degeneracy of
the hydrogen-exhausted core. Moreover, for the clusters with 1.1 M{\odot} <
M_hook < 1.3 M{\odot}, there are a MS gap and a peak on the left of the MS gap
in the distributions of{\nu}_max and {\Delta}{\nu}, which may be applied to
constrain the central hydrogen abundance of stars in the MS gap and the peak.

"Title:
Multidimensional models of hydrogen and helium emission line profiles  for classical T Tauri Stars: method, tests and examples","
Abstract: We present multidimensional non-LTE radiative transfer models of hydrogen and
helium line profiles formed in the accretion flows and the outflows near the
star-disk interaction regions of classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). The
statistical equilibrium calculations, performed under the assumption of the
Sobolev approximation using the radiative transfer code TORUS, has been
improved to include He I and He II energy levels. This allows us to probe the
physical conditions of the inner wind of CTTSs by simultaneously modelling the
robust wind diagnostic line He I (10830) and the accretion diagnostic lines
such as Pa-beta, Br-gamma and He I (5876). The code has been tested in 1 and
2-D problems, and we have shown that the results are in agreement with
established codes. We apply the model to the complex flow geometries of CTTSs.
Example model profiles are computed using the combinations of (1)
magnetospheric accretion and disc wind, and (2) magnetospheric accretion and
the stellar wind. In both cases, the model produces line profiles which are
qualitatively similar to those found in observations. Our models are consistent
with the scenario in which the narrow blueshifted absorption component of He I
(10830) seen in observations is caused by a disc wind, and the wider
blueshifted absorption component (the P-Cygni profile) is caused by a bipolar
stellar wind. However, we do not have a strong constraint on the relative
importance of the wind and the magnetosphere for the `emission' component. Our
preliminary calculations suggest that the temperatures of the disc wind,
stellar wind and the magnetosphere cannot be much higher than ~10,000 K, on the
basis of the strengths of hydrogen lines. With these low temperatures, we find
that the photoionzation by high energy photons (e.g. X-rays) is necessary to
produce He I (10830) in emission and to produce the blueshifted absorption
components.

Transit Analysis Package (TAP and autoKep): IDL Graphical User  Interfaces for Extrasolar Planet Transit Photometry","
Abstract: We present an IDL graphical user interface-driven software package designed
for the analysis of extrasolar planet transit light curves. The Transit
Analysis Package (TAP) software uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques
to fit light curves using the analytic model of Mandel and Agol (2002). The
package incorporates a wavelet based likelihood function developed by Carter
and Winn (2009) which allows the MCMC to assess parameter uncertainties more
robustly than classic chi-squared methods by parameterizing uncorrelated
""white"" and correlated ""red"" noise. The software is able to simultaneously
analyze multiple transits observed in different conditions (instrument, filter,
weather, etc). The graphical interface allows for the simple execution and
interpretation of Bayesian MCMC analysis tailored to a user's specific data set
and has been thoroughly tested on ground-based and Kepler photometry. AutoKep
provides a similar GUI for the preparation of Kepler MAST archive data for
analysis by TAP or any other analysis software. This paper describes the

Spectroscopic Determination of the Low Redshift Type Ia Supernova Rate  from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey","
Abstract: Supernova rates are directly coupled to high mass stellar birth and
evolution. As such, they are one of the few direct measures of the history of
cosmic stellar evolution. In this paper we describe an probabilistic technique
for identifying supernovae within spectroscopic samples of galaxies. We present

at the 1{\sigma}, but is consistent at the 3{\sigma} level. The 52 supernova
candidates used in this study comprise the third largest sample of supernovae
used in a type Ia rate determination to date. In this paper we demonstrate the
potential for the described approach for detecting supernovae in future
spectroscopic surveys.

The capture of dark matter particles through the evolution of low-mass  stars","
Abstract: We studied the rate at which stars capture dark matter (DM) particles,
considering different assumptions regarding the DM characteristics and in
particular investigating how the stellar physics influences the capture rate.
Two scenarios were considered: first, we assumed the maximal values for the
spin-dependent and spin-independent DM particle-nucleon scattering cross
sections allowed by the limits from direct detection experiments. Second, we
considered that both scattering cross sections are of the same order, with the
aim of studying the dependencies of the capture rate on stellar elements other
than hydrogen. We found that the characteristics of the capture rate are very
different in the two scenarios. Furthermore, we quantified the uncertainties on
the computed capture rate (C_x) and on the ratio between the luminosities from
DM annihilations and thermonuclear reactions (L_x/L_nuc) derived from an
imprecise knowledge of the stellar structure and DM parameters. For instance,
while an uncertainty of 10% on the typical DM velocity leads to similar errors
on the computed C_x and L_x/L_nuc, the same uncertainty on the stellar mass
becomes more relevant and duplicates the errors. Our results may be used to
evaluate the reliability of the computed capture rate for the hypothetical use
of stars other than the Sun as DM probes.

Detection of flux emergence, splitting, merging, and cancellation in  quiet Sun","
Abstract: We investigate the frequency of magnetic activities, namely flux emergence,
splitting, merging, and cancellation, through an automatic detection in order
to understand the generation of the power-law distribution of magnetic flux
reported by Parnell et al. (2009). The quiet Sun magnetograms observed in the
Na I line by Hinode/ SOT is used in this study. Investigated patches range from
10^{17}Mx to 10^{19}Mx. Emergence and cancellation are much less frequent than
merging and splitting. The time scale for splitting is found to be ~33 minutes
and is independent of the flux contained in the splitting patch. Moreover
magnetic patches split into any flux contents with an equal probability. It is
shown that such a fragmentation process leads to a distribution with a
power-law index -2. Merging has a very weak dependence on flux content only
with a power-law index -0.33. These results suggest that 1) magnetic patches
are fragmented by splitting, merging, and tiny cancellation; 2) flux is removed
from the photosphere through tiny cancellations after these fragmentations.

Abstract: Modifications on the predictions about the matter power spectrum based on the

systematic way of accounting for all the cosmological perturbations, through
the Boltzmann equation we obtain the analytical results for density

Small contributions to the matter power spectrum are analytically obtained for

Lessons concerning the formation of large scale structures of a DFG are
depicted, and consequent deviations from standard $\Lambda$CDM predictions for

X-ray bursts and burst oscillations from the slowly spinning X-ray  pulsar IGR J17480-2446 (Terzan 5)","
Abstract: The newly discovered 11 Hz accreting pulsar, IGR J17480-2446, located in the
globular cluster Terzan 5, has shown several bursts with a recurrence time as
short as few minutes. The source shows the shortest recurrence time ever
observed from a neutron star. Here we present a study of the morphological,
spectral and temporal properties of 107 of the bursts observed by the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer. The recurrence time and the fluence of the bursts
clearly anticorrelate with the increase of the persistent X-ray flux. The ratio
between the energy generated by the accretion of mass and that liberated during
bursts indicate that Helium is ignited in a Hydrogen rich layer. Therefore we
conclude that all the bursts shown by IGR J17480-2446 are Type-I X-Ray bursts.
Pulsations could be detected in all the brightest bursts and no drifts of the
frequency are observed within 0.25 Hz of the spin frequency of the neutron
star. These are also phase locked with respect to the pulsations observed
during the persistent emission and no rise of the rms associated to the pulse
frequency is observed during the burst. This behavior would favor a scenario
where the flash is ignited within a region which is consistent to be as large
as the neutron star surface.

Density Enhancements and Voids following Patchy Reconnection","
Abstract: We show, through a simple patchy reconnection model, that retracting
reconnected flux tubes may present elongated regions relatively devoid of
plasma, as well as long lasting, dense central hot regions. Reconnection is
assumed to happen in a small patch across a Syrovatski\'i (non-uniform) current
sheet (CS) with skewed magnetic fields. The background magnetic pressure has
its maximum at the center of the CS plane, and decreases toward the edges of
the plane. The reconnection patch creates two V-shaped reconnected tubes that
shorten as they retract in opposite directions, due to magnetic tension. One of
them moves upward toward the top edge of the CS, and the other one moves
downward toward the top of the underlying arcade. Rotational discontinuities
(RDs) propagate along the legs of the tubes and generate parallel super-sonic
flows that collide at the center of the tube. There, gas dynamics shocks that
compress and heat the plasma are launched outwardly. The descending tube moves
through the bottom part of the CS where it expands laterally in response to the
background magnetic pressure. This effect may decrease plasma density by 30 %
to 50 % of background levels. This tube will arrive at the top of the arcade
that will slow it down to a stop. Here, the perpendicular dynamics is halted,
but the parallel dynamics continues along its legs; the RDs are shut down, and
the gas is rarified to even lower densities. The hot postshock regions continue
evolving, determining a long lasting hot region on top of the arcade. We
provide an observational method based on total emission measure and mean
temperature, that indicates where in the CS the tube has been reconnected.

"Title:
Gas inflows, star formation and metallicity evolution in galaxy pairs","
Abstract: It has been known since many decades that galaxy interactions can induce star
formation (hereafter SF) enhancements and that one of the driving mechanisms of
this enhancement is related to gas inflows into the central galaxy regions,
induced by asymmetries in the stellar component, like bars. In the last years
many evidences have been accumulating, showing that interacting pairs have
central gas-phase metallicities lower than those of field galaxies, by {\sim}
0.2-0.3 dex on average. These diluted ISM metallicities have been explained as
the result of inflows of metal-poor gas from the outer disk to the galaxy
central regions. A number of questions arises: What's the timing and the
duration of this dilution? How and when does the SF induced by the gas inflow
enrich the circumnuclear gas with re-processed material? Is there any
correlation between the timing and strength of the dilution and the timing and
intensity of the SF? By means of Tree-SPH simulations of galaxy major
interactions, we have studied the effect that gas inflows have on the ISM
dilution, and the effect that the induced SF has, subsequently, in re-enriching
the nuclear gas. In this contribution, we present the main results of this
study.

accreting at high Eddington ratios. We deconvolve each ACS image into a nuclear

galaxies can be classified as having pseudobulges. All ten galaxies lie below
the \mbh--L$_{bulge}$ relation, confirming earlier results. Their locus is
similar to that occupied by pseudobulges. This leads us to conclude that the
growth of BHs in NLS1s is governed by secular processes rather than
merger-driven. Active galaxies in pseudobulges point to an alternative track of
black hole--galaxy co-evolution. Because of the intrinsic scatter in black hole
mass--bulge properties scaling relations caused by a combination of factors
such as the galaxy morphology, orientation, and redshift evolution, application
of scaling relations to determine BH masses may not be as straightforward as

Abstract: Small-scale magnetic features are present everywhere in the solar

describing the formation of these features have existed for a few decades, but
there are only a few observational studies in direct support of the
simulations. In this study we present the evolution of small-scale magnetic
features with a spatial resolution close to 0.15 arcsecond and compare these
observations with those predicted by numerical simulations and also with
previous observational work of a similar nature. We analyze a 40 min time
sequence of full Stokes spectropolarimetric 630.25 nm data from a plage region
near the Sun center. We use line-of-sight velocities and magnetic field
measurements obtained using Milne-Eddington inversion techniques with and
without stray-light compensation along with measured continuum and line minimum
intensities. We discuss the results in relation to earlier observations and
simulations. We present eight cases involving strong downflows and magnetic
field intensification. All cases studied are associated with the formation of a
bright point in the continuum. In three out of the eight cases we find the
presence of weak opposite polarity field in close proximity to the downflow.
Our data are consistent with earlier simulations describing flux tube collapse,
but the transition to a state with stronger field appears transient and
short-lived, rather than resulting in a permanent field intensification. Three
cases of weak opposite polarity field found adjacent to the downflows do not
appear related to reconnection but may be related to overturning convection
pulling down some field lines and leading to up/down ""serpentine"" field, as
seen in some simulations.

Physical and radiative properties of the first core accretion shock","
Abstract: Radiative shocks play a dominant role in star formation. The accretion shocks
on the first and second Larson's cores involve radiative processes and are thus
characteristic of radiative shocks. In this study, we explore the formation of
the first Larson's core and characterize the radiative and dynamical properties
of the accretion shock, using both analytical and numerical approaches. We
develop both numerical RHD calculations and a semi-analytical model that
characterize radiative shocks in various physical conditions, for radiating or
barotropic fluids. Then, we perform 1D spherical collapse calculations of the
first Larson's core, using a grey approximation for the opacity of the
material. We consider three different models for radiative transfer, namely:
the barotropic approximation, the FLD approximation and the more complete M1
model. We investigate the characteristic properties of the collapse and of the
first core formation. Comparison between the numerical results and our
semi-analytical model shows that this latter reproduces quite well the core
properties obtained with the numerical calculations. The accretion shock on the
first Larson core is found to be supercritical, implying that all the accretion
shock energy on the core is radiated away. The FLD approximation is found to
agree quite well with the results based on the M1 model, and is thus
appropriate to study the star formation process. In contrast, the barotropic
approximation does not correctly describe the thermal properties of the gas
during the collapse. We show that a consistent treatment of radiation and
hydrodynamics is mandatory to correctly handle the cooling of the gas during
the core formation and thus to obtain the correct mechanical and thermal
properties for this latter.

SPH Simulations of Black Hole Accretion: A Step to Model Black Hole  Feedback in Galaxies","
Abstract: (Abridged) We test how accurately the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
numerical technique can follow spherically-symmetric Bondi accretion. Using the
3D SPH code GADGET-3, we perform simulations of gas accretion onto a central
supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass 10^8 M_sun within the radial range of
0.1 - 200 pc. We carry out simulations without and with radiative heating by a
central X-ray corona and radiative cooling. For an adiabatic case, the radial
profiles of hydrodynamical properties match the Bondi solution, except near the
inner and outer radius of the computational domain. We find that adiabatic
Bondi accretion can be reproduced for durations of a few dynamical times at the
Bondi radius, and for longer times if the outer radius is increased. With
radiative heating and cooling included, the spherically accreting gas takes a
longer time to reach a steady-state than the adiabatic Bondi accretion runs,
and in some cases does not reach a steady-state even within several hundred
dynamical times. We find that artificial viscosity in the GADGET code causes
excessive heating near the inner radius, making the thermal properties of the
gas inconsistent with a physical solution. This overheating occurs typically
only in the supersonic part of the flow, so that it does not affect the mass
accretion rate. We see that increasing the X-ray luminosity produces a lower
central mass inflow rate, implying that feedback due to radiative heating is
operational in our simulations. With a sufficiently high X-ray luminosity, the
inflowing gas is radiatively heated up, and an outflow develops. We conclude
that the SPH simulations can capture the gas dynamics needed to study radiative
feedback provided artificial viscosity alters only highly supersonic part of
the inflow.

Bulk flows from galaxy luminosities: application to 2MASS redshift  survey and forecast for next-generation datasets","
Abstract: We present a simple method for measuring cosmological bulk flows from large
redshift surveys, based on the apparent dimming or brightening of galaxies due
to their peculiar motion. It is aimed at estimating bulk flows of cosmological
volumes containing large numbers of galaxies. Constraints on the bulk flow are
obtained by minimizing systematic variations in galaxy luminosities with
respect to a reference luminosity function measured from the whole survey. This
method offers two advantages over more popular bulk flow estimators: it is
independent of error-prone distance indicators and of the poorly-known galaxy
bias. We apply the method to the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS) to measure the
local bulk flows of spherical shells centered on the Milky Way (MW). The result
is consistent with that obtained by Nusser and Davis (2011) using the SFI++
catalogue of Tully-Fisher distance indicators.
We also make an assessment of the ability of the method to constrain bulk
flows at larger redshifts ($z=0.1-0.5$) from next generation datasets. As a
case study we consider the planned EUCLID survey. Using this method we will be
able to measure a bulk motion of $ \sim 200 \kms$ of $10^6$ galaxies with
photometric redshifts, at the $3\sigma$ level for both $z\sim 0.15$ and $z\sim

Is the metallicity of their hosts a good measure of the metallicity of  Type Ia supernovae?","
Abstract: The efficient use of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) for cosmological studies
requires knowledge of any parameter that can affect their luminosity in either
systematic or statistical ways. Observational samples of SNIa commonly use the
metallicity of the host galaxy, Z_host, as an estimator of the supernova
progenitor metallicity, Z_Ia, that is one of the primary factors affecting SNIa
magnitude. Here, we present a theoretical study of the relationship between
Z_Ia and Z_host. We follow the chemical evolution of homogeneous galaxy models
together with the evolution of the supernova rates in order to evaluate the
metallicity distribution function, MDF(Delta Z), i.e. the probability that the
logarithm of the metallicity of a SNIa exploding now differs in less than Delta
Z from that of its host. We analyse several model galaxies aimed to represent
from active to passive galaxies, including dwarf galaxies prone to experience
supernova driven outflows. We analyse the sensitivity of the MDF to uncertain
ingredients: IMF, star-formation law, stellar lifetime, stellar yields, and
SNIa delay-time distribution. There is a remarkable degree of agreement between
the mean Z_Ia in a galaxy and its Z_host when they both are measured as the CNO
abundance, especially if the DTD peaks at small time delays, while the average
Fe abundance of host and SNIa may differ up to 0.4-0.6 dex in passive galaxies.
The dispersion of Z_Ia in active galaxy models is quite small, meaning that
Z_host is a quite good estimator of the supernova metallicity. Passive galaxies
present a larger dispersion, which is more pronounced in low mass galaxies. We
discuss the use of different metallicity indicators: Fe vs. O, and gas-phase
metallicity vs. stellar metallicity. The results of the application of our
formalism to a galactic catalogue (VESPA) are roughly consistent with our
theoretical estimates. (abridged)

Static Solutions with Spherical Symmetry in f(T) Theories","
Abstract: The spherically symmetric static solutions are searched for in some f(T)
models of gravity theory with a Maxwell term. To do this, we demonstrate that
reconstructing the Lagrangian of f(T) theories is sensitive to the choice of
frame, and then we introduce a particular frame based on the conformally
Cartesian coordinates. In this particular frame, the existence conditions of
various solutions are presented. Our results imply that only a limited class of
f(T) models can be solved in this frame. For more general models, the search
for spherically symmetric static solutions is still an open and challenging
problem, hopefully solvable in other frames.

"Title:
Micro-pixel accuracy centroid displacement estimation and detector  calibration","
Abstract: Precise centroid estimation plays a critical role in accurate astrometry
using telescope images. Conventional centroid estimation fits a template point
spread function (PSF) to the image data. Because the PSF is typically not known
to high accuracy due to wavefront aberrations and uncertainties in optical
system, a simple Gaussian function is commonly used. PSF knowledge error leads
to systematic errors in the conventional centroid estimation. In this paper, we
present an accurate centroid estimation algorithm by reconstructing the PSF
from well sampled (above Nyquist frequency) pixelated images. In the limit of
an ideal focal plane array whose pixels have identical response function (no
inter-pixel variation), this method can estimate centroid displacement between
two 32$\times$32 images to sub-micropixel accuracy. Inter-pixel response
variations exist in real detectors, {\it e.g.}~CCDs, which we can calibrate by
measuring the pixel response of each pixel in Fourier space. The Fourier
transforms of the inter-pixel variations of pixel response functions can be
conveniently expressed in terms of powers of spatial wave numbers using their
Taylor series expansions. Calibrating up to the third order terms in this
expansion, we show that our centroid displacement estimation is accurate to a
few micro-pixels using simulated data. This algorithm is applicable to the new
proposed mission concept Nearest Earth Astrometry Telescope (NEAT) to achieve
mirco-arcsecond accuracy in relative astrometry for detecting terrestrial
exoplanets. This technology is also applicable to high precision photometry
missions.

The First Observations of Low Redshift Damped Lyman-alpha Systems with  the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph","
Abstract: We report on the first Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) observations of
damped and sub-damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems discovered in a new survey of
the gaseous halos of low-redshift galaxies. From observations of 37 sightlines,
we have discovered three DLAs and four sub-DLAs. We measure the neutral gas
density Omega(HI), and redshift density dN/dz, of DLA and sub-DLA systems at
z<0.35. We find dN/dz=0.25 and Omega(HI)=1.4x10^-3 for DLAs, and dN/dz=0.08
with Omega(HI)=4.2x10^-5 for sub-DLAs over a redshift path delta z=11.9. To
demonstrate the scientific potential of such systems, we present a detailed
analysis of the DLA at z=0.1140 in the spectrum of SDSS J1009+0713. Profile
fits to the absorption lines determine log N(H I)=20.68pm0.10 with a
metallicity determined from the undepleted element Sulfur of [S/H]=-0.62pm0.18.
The abundance pattern of this DLA is similar to that of higher z DLAs, showing
mild depletion of the refractory elements Fe and Ti with [S/Fe]=+0.24pm0.22 and
[S/Ti]=+0.28pm0.15. Nitrogen is underabundant in this system with
[N/H]=-1.40pm0.14, placing this DLA below the plateau of the [N/alpha]
measurements in the local Universe at similar metallicities. This DLA has a
simple kinematic structure with only two components required to fit the
profiles and a kinematic width of 52 km/s. Imaging of the QSO field with WFC3
reveals a spiral galaxy at very small impact parameter to the QSO and several
galaxies within 10"". Followup spectra with LRIS reveal that none of the nearby
galaxies are at the redshift of the DLA. The spiral galaxy is identified as the
host galaxy of the QSO based on the near perfect alignment of the nucleus and
disk of the galaxy as well as spectra of an H II region showing emission lines
at the QSO redshift. A small feature appears 0.70"" from the nucleus of the QSO
after PSF subtraction, providing another candidate for the host galaxy of the
DLA. (abb)

"Title:
Stellar mass black holes in star clusters: gravitational wave emission  and detection rates","
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of stellar-mass black holes (BH) in star clusters
focusing on the dynamical formation of BH-BH binaries, which are very important
sources of gravitational waves (GW). We examine the properties of these BH-BH
binaries through direct N-body computations of Plummer clusters, having
initially N(0) <= 10^5 low mass stars and a population of stellar mass BHs,
using the state-of-the-art N-body integrator ""NBODY6"". We find that the stellar
mass BHs segregate rapidly into the cluster core to form a central dense
sub-cluster of BHs in which BH-BH binaries form via 3-body encounters. While
most of the BH binaries finally escape from the cluster by recoils due to
super-elastic encounters with the single BHs, we find that for clusters with
N(0) >= 5 X 10^4, typically a few of them dynamically harden to the extent that
they can merge via GW emission within the cluster. Also, for each of such
clusters, there are a few escaped BH binaries that merge within a Hubble time,
most of the mergers happening within a few Gyr of cluster evolution. These
results imply that the intermediate-aged massive clusters constitute the most
important class of star clusters that can produce dynamical BH-BH mergers at
the present epoch. The BH-BH merger rates obtained from our computations imply
a significant detection rate (~ 30/yr) for the ""Advanced LIGO"" GW detector that
will become operative in the near future. Finally, we briefly discuss our
ongoing development on this work incorporating the formation of BHs in star
clusters from stellar evolution. In particular, we highlight the effect of
stellar metallicity on the BH sub-cluster driven expansion of a star cluster's
core.

"Title:
The role of planets in shaping planetary nebulae","
Abstract: In 1997 Soker laid out a framework for understanding the formation and
shaping of planetary nebulae (PN). Starting from the assumption that
non-spherical PN cannot be formed by single stars, he linked PN morphologies to
the binary mechanisms that may have formed them, basing these connections
almost entirely on observational arguments. In light of the last decade of
discovery in the field of PN, we revise this framework, which, although
simplistic, can still serve as a benchmark against which to test theories of PN
origin and shaping. Within the framework, we revisit the role of planets in
shaping PN. Soker invoked a planetary role in shaping PN because there are not
enough close binaries to shape the large fraction of non-spherical PN. In this
paper we adopt a model whereby only ~20% of all 1-8 solar mass stars make a PN.
This reduces the need for planetary shaping. Through a propagation of
percentages argument, and starting from the assumption that planets can only
shape mildly elliptical PN, we conclude, like in Soker, that ~20% of all PN
were shaped via planetary and other substellar interactions but we add that
this corresponds to only ~5% of all 1-8 solar mass stars. This may be in line
with findings of planets around main sequence stars. PN shaping by planets is
made plausible by the recent discovery of planets that have survived
interactions with red giant branch (RGB) stars. Finally, we conclude that of
the ~80% of 1-8 solar mass stars that do not make a PN, about one quarter do
not even ascend the AGB due to interactions with stellar and substellar
companions, while three quarters ascend the AGB but do not make a PN. Once
these stars leave the AGB they evolve normally and can be confused with
post-RGB, extreme horizontal branch stars. We propose tests to identify them.

Architecture and Dynamics of Kepler's Candidate Multiple Transiting  Planet Systems","
Abstract: About one-third of the ~1200 transiting planet candidates detected in the
first four months of \ik data are members of multiple candidate systems. There
are 115 target stars with two candidate transiting planets, 45 with three, 8
with four, and one each with five and six. We characterize the dynamical
properties of these candidate multi-planet systems. The distribution of
observed period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs are
neither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances. Nonetheless, there are
small but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both in
resonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularly
near the 2:1 resonance. We find that virtually all candidate systems are
stable, as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radius
relationship. Several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority of
these multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. Using the observed
multiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population of planetary systems
that matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number of
singly-transiting systems. We provide constraints on the true multiplicity and
mutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing a
population of systems with multiple super-Earth-size and Neptune-size planets
with low to moderate mutual inclinations.

Cosmological Large-scale Structures beyond Linear Theory in Modified  Gravity","
Abstract: We consider the effect of modified gravity on the growth of large-scale
structures at second order in perturbation theory. We show that modified
gravity models changing the linear growth rate of fluctuations are also bound
to change, although mildly, the mode coupling amplitude in the density and
reduced velocity fields. We present explicit formulae which describe this
effect. We then focus on models of modified gravity involving a scalar field
coupled to matter, in particular chameleons and dilatons, where it is shown
that there exists a transition scale around which the existence of an extra
scalar degree of freedom induces significant changes in the coupling properties
of the cosmic fields. We obtain the amplitude of this effect for realistic
dilaton models at the tree-order level for the bispectrum, finding them to be
comparable in amplitude to those obtained in the DGP model.

"Title:
On Estimating Lyman-alpha Forest Correlations between Multiple  Sightlines","
Abstract: The next frontier of Lyman-alpha forest studies is the reconstruction of 3D
correlations from a dense sample of background sources. The measurement of 3D
correlations has the potential to improve constraints on fundamental
cosmological parameters, ionizing background models, and the reionization
history. This study addresses the sensitivity of spectroscopic surveys to 3D
correlations in the Lyman-alpha forest. We show that the sensitivity of a
survey to this signal can be quantified by just a single number, a
noise-weighted number density of sources on the sky. We investigate how the
sensitivity of a spectroscopic quasar (or galaxy) survey scales as a function
of its depth, area, and redshift. We propose a simple method for weighting
sightlines with varying S/N levels to estimate the correlation function, and we
show that this estimator generally performs nearly as well as the minimum
variance quadratic estimator. In addition, we show that the sensitivity of a
quasar survey to the flux correlation function is generally maximized if it
observes each field just long enough to achieve S/N ~ 2 in a 1 A pixel on an
L_* quasar while acquiring spectra for all quasars with L > L_*: Little is
gained by integrating longer on the same targets or by including fainter
quasars. We quantify how these considerations relate to constraints on the
angular diameter distance, the curvature of space-time, and the reionization
history.

"Title:
Metallicity and the Universality of the IMF","
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF), along with the star formation rate,
is one of the fundamental properties that any theory of star formation must
explain. An interesting feature of the IMF is that it appears to be remarkably
universal across a wide range of environments. Particularly, there appears to
be little variation in either the characteristic mass of the IMF or its
high-mass tail between clusters with different metallicities. Previous attempts
to understand this apparent independence of metallicity have not accounted for
radiation feedback from high-mass protostars, which can dominate the energy
balance of the gas in star-forming regions. We extend this work, showing that
the fragmentation of molecular gas should depend only weakly on the amount of
dust present, even when the primary heating source is radiation from massive
protostars. First, we report a series of core collapse simulations using the
ORION AMR code that systematically vary the dust opacity and show explicitly
that this has little effect on the temperature or fragmentation of the gas.
Then, we provide an analytic argument for why the IMF varies so little in
observed star clusters, even as the metallicity varies by a factor of 100.

The Metric of the Cosmos from Luminosity and Age Data","
Abstract: This paper presents the algorithm for determining the Lemaitre-Tolman (LT)
model that best fits given datasets for maximum stellar ages, and SNIa
luminosities, both as functions of redshift. It then applies it to current
cosmological data. Special attention must be given to the handling of the
origin, and the region of the maximum diameter distances. As with a previous
combination of datasets (galaxy number counts and luminosity distances versus
redshift), there are relationships that must hold at the region of the maximum
diameter distance, which are unlikely to be obeyed exactly by real data. We
show how to make corrections that enable a self-consistent solution to be
found. We address the questions of the best way to approximate discrete data
with smooth functions, and how to estimate the uncertainties of the output -
the 3 free functions that determine a specific LT metric. While current data
does not permit any confidence in our results, we show that the method works
well, and reasonable LT models do fit with or without a cosmological constant.

"Title:
Metals at the surface of last scatter","
Abstract: Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) predicts only a trace abundance of
lithium and no heavier elements, but some alternatives predict a nonzero
primordial metallicity. Here we explore whether CMB measurements may set useful
constraints to the primordial metallicity and/or whether the standard CMB
calculations are robust, within the tolerance of forthcoming CMB maps, to the
possibility of primordial metals. Metals would affect the recombination history
(and thus CMB power spectra) in three ways: (1) Lyman-alpha photons can be
removed (and recombination thus accelerated) by photoionizing metals. (2) The
Bowen resonance-fluorescence mechanism may degrade Lyman-beta photons and thus
enhance the Lyman-beta escape probability and speed up recombination. (3)
Metals could affect the low-redshift tail of the CMB visibility function by
providing additional free electrons. The last two of these provide the
strongest CMB signal. However, the effects are detectable in the Planck
satellite only if the primordial metal abundance is at least a few hundredths
of solar for (2) and a few tenths of solar for (3). We thus conclude that
Planck will not be able to improve upon current constraints to primordial
metallicity, at the level of a thousandth of solar, from the Lyman-alpha forest
and ultra-metal-poor halo stars, and that the CMB power-spectrum predictions
for Planck suffer no uncertainty arising from the possibility that there may be
primordial metals.

Abstract: Internal gravity waves are excited at the interface of convection and
radiation zones of a solar-type star by the tidal forcing of a short-period

on their amplitude. We discuss the results of numerical simulations of these

of the central regions of the star, and the orbit of the planet. If the waves
break, we find efficient tidal dissipation, which is not present if the waves
perfectly reflect from the centre. This highlights an important amplitude
dependence of the (stellar) tidal quality factor Q', which has implications for
the survival of planets on short-period orbits around solar-type stars, with

Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianity has emerged as one of the most promising probes of
the inflationary epoch. While the cosmic microwave background and large-scale

which may allow tests of Gaussianity which are independent of the precise form
of non-Gaussian initial conditions. We study the halo mass function in N-body
simulations with a range of non-Gaussian initial conditions. In addition to the
usual fNL model, we consider gNL Phi^3-type non-Gaussianity and models where
the 4-point amplitude tauNL is an independent parameter. We introduce a new
analytic form for the halo mass function in the presence of primordial
non-Gaussianity, the ""log-Edgeworth"" mass function, and find good agreement
with the N-body simulations. The log-Edgeworth mass function introduces no free
parameters and can be constructed from first principles for any model of

Large-scale shock-ionized and photo-ionized gas in M83: the impact of  star formation","
Abstract: We investigate the ionization structure of the nebular gas in M83 using the
line diagnostic diagram, [O III](5007 \degA)/H{\beta} vs. [S II](6716 \deg
A+6731 \deg A)/H{\alpha} with the newly available narrowband images from the
Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We produce the
diagnostic diagram on a pixel-by-pixel (0.2"" x 0.2"") basis and compare it with
several photo- and shock-ionization models. For the photo-ionized gas, we
observe a gradual increase of the log([O III]/H{\beta}) ratios from the center
to the spiral arm, consistent with the metallicity gradient, as the H II
regions go from super solar abundance to roughly solar abundance from the
center out. Using the diagnostic diagram, we separate the photo-ionized from
the shock-ionized component of the gas. We find that the shock-ionized
H{\alpha} emission ranges from ~2% to about 15-33% of the total, depending on
the separation criteria used. An interesting feature in the diagnostic diagram
is an horizontal distribution around log([O III]/H{\beta}) ~ 0. This feature is
well fit by a shock-ionization model with 2.0 Z\odot metallicity and shock
velocities in the range of 250 km/s to 350 km/s. A low velocity shock
component, < 200 km/s, is also detected, and is spatially located at the
boundary between the outer ring and the spiral arm. The low velocity shock
component can be due to : 1) supernova remnants located nearby, 2) dynamical
interaction between the outer ring and the spiral arm, 3) abnormal line ratios
from extreme local dust extinction. The current data do not enable us to
distinguish among those three possible interpretations. Our main conclusion is
that, even at the HST resolution, the shocked gas represents a small fraction
of the total ionized gas emission at less than 33% of the total. However, it
accounts for virtually all of the mechanical energy produced by the central
starburst in M83.

and more recent X-ray observations of 3C 445 performed with XMM-Newton and

outflowing absorber varied. We argue that the absorber is probably associated

Predictive Signatures of Supersymmetry: Measuring the Dark Matter Mass  and Gluino Mass with Early LHC data","
Abstract: We present a focused study of a predictive unified model whose measurable
consequences are immediately relevant to early discovery prospects of
supersymmetry at the LHC. ATLAS and CMS have released their analysis with
35~pb$^{-1}$ of data and the model class we discuss is consistent with this
data. It is shown that with an increase in luminosity the LSP dark matter mass
and the gluino mass can be inferred from simple observables such as kinematic
edges in leptonic channels and peak values in effective mass distributions.
Specifically, we consider cases in which the neutralino is of low mass and
where the relic density consistent with WMAP observations arises via the
exchange of Higgs bosons in unified supergravity models. The magnitudes of the
gaugino masses are sharply limited to focused regions of the parameter space,
and in particular the dark matter mass lies in the range $\sim (50-65) ~\rm
GeV$ with an upper bound on the gluino mass of $575~{\rm GeV}$, with a typical
mass of $450~{\rm GeV}$. We find that all model points in this paradigm are
discoverable at the LHC at $\sqrt s = 7 \rm ~TeV$. We determine lower bounds on
the entire sparticle spectrum in this model based on existing experimental
constraints. In addition, we find the spin-independent cross section for
neutralino scattering on nucleons to be generally in the range of $\sigma^{\rm
SI}_{\na p} = 10^{-46 \pm 1}~\rm cm^2$ with much higher cross sections also
possible. Thus direct detection experiments such as CDMS and XENON already
constrain some of the allowed parameter space of the low mass gaugino models

Quiescent X-ray variability from the neutron star transient Aql X-1","
Abstract: A number of studies have revealed variability from neutron star low-mass
X-ray binaries during quiescence. Such variability is not well characterised,

variability between the epochs, with the most striking feature being a
flare-like increase in the flux by a factor of 5. Spectral fitting is
inconclusive as to whether the power-law and/or thermal component is variable.
We suggest that the variability and flare-like behaviour during quiescence is
due to accretion at low rates which might reach the neutron star surface.

Energy Spectrum Of Nonthermal Electrons Accelerated At A Plane Shock","
Abstract: We calculate the energy spectra of cosmic ray (CR) protons and electrons at a
plane shock with quasi-parallel magnetic fields, using time-dependent,
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) simulations, including energy losses via
synchrotron emission and Inverse Compton (IC) scattering. A thermal leakage
injection model and a Bohm type diffusion coefficient are adopted. The electron
spectrum at the shock becomes steady after the DSA energy gains balance the
synchrotron/IC losses, and it cuts off at the equilibrium momentum p_{eq}. In
the postshock region the cutoff momentum of the electron spectrum decreases
with the distance from the shock due to the energy losses and the thickness of
the spatial distribution of electrons scales as p^{-1}. Thus the slope of the
downstream integrated spectrum steepens by one power of p for p_{br}<p<p_{eq},
where the break momentum decrease with the shock age as p_{br}\propto t^{-1}.
In a CR modified shock, both the proton and electron spectrum exhibit a concave
curvature and deviate from the canonical test-particle power-law, and the
upstream integrated electron spectrum could dominate over the downstream
integrated spectrum near the cutoff momentum. Thus the spectral shape near the
cutoff of X-ray synchrotron emission could reveal a signature of nonlinear DSA.

"Title:
Relaxation of protostellar accretion shocks using the smoothed particle  hydrodynamics","
Abstract: It is believed that protostellar accretion disks to be formed from nearly
ballistic infall of the molecular matters in rotating core collapse. Collisions
of these infalling matters lead to formation of strong supersonic shocks, which
if they cool rapidly, result in accumulation of that material in a thin
structure in the equatorial plane. Here, we investigate the relaxation time of
the protostellar accretion post-shock gas using the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH). For this purpose, a one-dimensional head-on collision of
two molecular sheets is considered, and the time evolution of the temperature
and density of the post-shock region simulated. The results show that in strong
supersonic shocks, the temperature of the post-shock gas quickly increases
proportional to square of the Mach number, and then gradually decreases
according to the cooling processes. Using a suitable cooling function shows
that in appropriate time-scale, the center of the collision, which is at the
equatorial plane of the core, is converted to a thin dense molecular disk,
together with atomic and ionized gases around it. This structure for accretion
disks may justify the suitable conditions for grain growth and formation of
proto-planetary entities.

Right-handed Sneutrino Dark Matter in Supersymmetric B-L Model","
Abstract: We show that the lightest right-handed sneutrino in TeV scale supersymmetric
B-L model with inverse seesaw mechanism is a viable candidate for cold dark
matter. We find that it accounts for the observed dark matter relic abundance
in a wide range of parameter space. The spin-independent cross section of B-L
right-handed sneutrino is consistent with the recent results CDMS II and XENON
experiments and it is detectable in future direct detection experiments.
Although the B-L right-handed sneutrinos annihilate into leptons, the PAMELA
results can not be explained in this model unless a huge boost factor is
considered. Also the muon flux generated by B-L right-handed sneutrino in the
galactic center is smaller than Super-Kamiokande's upper bound.

Bayesian inference of solar and stellar magnetic fields in the  weak-field approximation","
Abstract: The weak-field approximation is one of the simplest models that allows us to
relate the observed polarization induced by the Zeeman effect with the magnetic
field vector present on the plasma of interest. It is usually applied for
diagnosing magnetic fields in the solar and stellar atmospheres. A fully
Bayesian approach to the inference of magnetic properties in unresolved
structures is presented. The analytical expression for the marginal posterior
distribution is obtained, from which we can obtain statistically relevant
information about the model parameters. The role of a-priori information is
discussed and a hierarchical procedure is presented that gives robust results
that are almost insensitive to the precise election of the prior. The strength
of the formalism is demonstrated through an application to IMaX data. Bayesian
methods can optimally exploit data from filter-polarimeters given the scarcity
of spectral information as compared with spectro-polarimeters. The effect of
noise and how it degrades our ability to extract information from the Stokes
profiles is analyzed in detail.

"Title:
An Accounting of the Dust-Obscured Star Formation and Accretion  Histories Over the Last ~11~Billion Years","
Abstract: (Abridged) We report on an accounting of the star formation and accretion
driven energetics of 24um detected sources in GOODS North. For sources having
infrared (IR; 8-1000um) luminosities >3x10^12 L_sun when derived by fitting
local SEDs to 24um photometry alone, we find these IR luminosity estimates to
be a factor of ~4 times larger than those estimated when the SED fitting
includes additional 16 and 70um data (and in some cases mid-infrared
spectroscopy and 850um data). This discrepancy arises from the fact that high
luminosity sources at z>>0 appear to have far- to mid-infrared ratios, as well
as aromatic feature equivalent widths, typical of lower luminosity galaxies in
the local Universe. Using our improved estimates for IR luminosity and AGN
contributions, we investigate the evolution of the IR luminosity density versus
redshift arising from star formation and AGN processes alone. We find that,
within the uncertainties, the total star formation driven IR luminosity density
is constant between 1.15 < z < 2.35, although our results suggest a slightly
larger value at z>2. AGN appear to account for <18% of the total IR luminosity
density integrated between 0< z < 2.35, contributing <25% at each epoch. LIRG
appear to dominate the star formation rate (SFR) density along with normal
star-forming galaxies (L_IR < 10^11 L_sun) between 0.6 < z < 1.15. Once beyond
z >2, the contribution from ultraluminous infrared galaxies ULIRGs becomes
comparable with that of LIRGs. Using our improved IR luminosity estimates, we
find existing calibrations for UV extinction corrections based on measurements
of the UV spectral slope typically overcorrect UV luminosities by a factor of
~2, on average, for our sample of 24um-selected sources; accordingly we have
derived a new UV extinction correction more appropriate for our sample.

"Title:
Binary progenitor models of type IIb supernovae","
Abstract: Massive stars that lose their hydrogen-rich envelope down to a few tenths of
a solar mass explode as extended type IIb supernovae, an intriguing subtype
that links the hydrogen-rich type II supernovae with the hydrogen-poor type Ib
and Ic. The progenitors may be very massive single stars that lose their
envelope due to their stellar wind, but mass stripping due to interaction with
a companion star in a binary system is currently considered to be the dominant
formation channel. We computed an extensive grid of binary models with the
Eggleton binary evolution code. The predicted rate from our standard models,
which assume conservative mass transfer, is about 6 times smaller than the
current rate indicated by observations. It is larger but still comparable to
the rate expected from single stars. To recover the observed rate we must
generously allow for uncertainties and low accretion efficiencies in
combination with limited angular momentum loss from the system. Motivated by
the claims of detection and non-detection of companions for a few IIb
supernovae, we investigate the properties of the secondary star at the moment
of explosion. We identify three cases: (1) the companion appears as a hot O
star in about 90% of the cases, (2) the companion becomes an over-luminous B
star in about 3% of the cases, or (3) the companion will appear as a K
supergiant. The second case, which applies to the well-studied case of SN 1993J
and possibly to SN 2001ig, is the least common case and requires that the
companion very efficiently accretes the transferred material -in contrast to
what is required to recover the overall IIb rate. The fast increasing number of
type IIb detections may lead to more solid constraints on model uncertainties,
like stellar wind-mass loss and internal mixing.

The Nonlinear Future-Stability of the FLRW Family of Solutions to the  Euler-Einstein System with a Positive Cosmological Constant","
Abstract: In this article, we study small perturbations of the family of
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmological background solutions to the
1 + 3 dimensional Euler-Einstein system with a positive cosmological constant.
These background solutions describe an initially uniform quiet fluid of
positive energy density evolving in a spacetime undergoing accelerated

pressure = c_s^2 * energy density, with 0 < c_s^2 < 1/3, the background
solutions are globally future-stable. In particular, we prove that the
perturbed spacetime solutions, which have the topological structure [0,infty) x
T^3, are future causally geodesically complete. These results are extensions of
previous results derived by the author in a collaboration with I. Rodnianski,
in which the fluid was assumed to be irrotational. Our novel analysis of a
fluid with non-zero vorticity is based on the use of suitably-defined energy
currents.

"Title:
Reassessing The Fundamentals: New Constraints on the Evolution, Ages and  Masses of Neutron Stars","
Abstract: The ages and masses of neutron stars (NSs) are two fundamental threads that
make pulsars accessible to other sub-disciplines of astronomy and physics. A
realistic and accurate determination of these two derived parameters play an
important role in understanding of advanced stages of stellar evolution and the
physics that govern relevant processes. Here I summarize new constraints on the
ages and masses of NSs with an evolutionary perspective. I show that the
observed P-Pdot demographics is more diverse than what is theoretically
predicted for the standard evolutionary channel. In particular, standard
recycling followed by dipole spin-down fails to reproduce the population of
millisecond pulsars with higher magnetic fields (B > 4 x 10^{8} G) at rates
deduced from observations. A proper inclusion of constraints arising from
binary evolution and mass accretion offers a more realistic insight into the
age distribution. By analytically implementing these constraints, I propose a
""modified"" spin-down age for millisecond pulsars that gives estimates closer to
the true age. Finally, I independently analyze the peak, skewness and cutoff
values of the underlying mass distribution from a comprehensive list of radio
pulsars for which secure mass measurements are available. The inferred mass
distribution shows clear peaks at 1.35 Msun and 1.50 Msun for NSs in double
neutron star (DNS) and neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) systems respectively. I
find a mass cutoff at 2 Msun for NSs with WD companions, which establishes a
firm lower bound for the maximum mass of NSs.

"Title:
Secular resonance sweeping of the main asteroid belt during planet  migration","
Abstract: We calculate the eccentricity excitation of asteroids produced by the
sweeping $\nu_6$ secular resonance during the epoch of planetesimal-driven
giant planet migration in the early history of the solar system. We derive
analytical expressions for the magnitude of the eccentricity change and its
dependence on the sweep rate and on planetary parameters; the $\nu_6$ sweeping
leads to either an increase or a decrease of eccentricity depending on an
asteroid's initial orbit. Based on the slowest rate of $\nu_6$ sweeping that
allows a remnant asteroid belt to survive, we derive a lower limit on Saturn's
migration speed of $\sim0.15\AU\My^{-1}$ during the era that the $\nu_6$
resonance swept through the inner asteroid belt (semimajor axis range
2.1--$2.8\AU$). This rate limit is for Saturn's current eccentricity, and
scales with the square of Saturn's eccentricity; the limit on Saturn's
migration rate could be lower if Saturn's eccentricity were lower during its
migration. Applied to an ensemble of fictitious asteroids, our calculations
show that a prior single-peaked distribution of asteroid eccentricities would
be transformed into a double-peaked distribution due to the sweeping of the
$\nu_6$. Examination of the orbital data of main belt asteroids reveals that
the proper eccentricities of the known bright ($H \leq10.8$) asteroids may be
consistent with a double-peaked distribution. If so, our theoretical analysis
then yields two possible solutions for the migration rate of Saturn and for the
dynamical states of the pre-migration asteroid belt: a dynamically cold state
(single-peaked eccentricity distribution with mean of $\sim0.05$) linked with
Saturn's migration speed $\sim 4\AU\My^{-1}$, or a dynamically hot state
(single-peaked eccentricity distribution with mean of $\sim0.3$) linked with
Saturn's migration speed $\sim 0.8\AU\My^{-1}$.

A low energy theory for superfluid and solid matter and its application  to the neutron star crust","
Abstract: We formulate a low energy effective theory describing phases of matter that
are both solid and superfluid. These systems simultaneously break translational
symmetry and the phase symmetry associated with particle number. The symmetries
restrict the combinations of terms that can appear in the effective action and
the lowest order terms featuring equal number of derivatives and Goldstone
fields are completely specified by the thermodynamic free energy, or
equivalently by the long-wavelength limit of static correlation functions in
the ground state. We show that the underlying interaction between particles
that constitute the lattice and the superfluid gives rise to entrainment, and
mixing between the Goldstone modes. As a concrete example we discuss the low
energy theory for the inner crust of a neutron star, where a lattice of ionized
nuclei coexists with a neutron superfluid.

"Title:
Radio transients from stellar tidal disruption by massive black holes","
Abstract: The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole provides us with
a rare glimpse of these otherwise dormant beasts. It has long been predicted
that the disruption will be accompanied by a thermal `flare', powered by the
accretion of bound stellar debris. Several candidate disruptions have been
discovered in this manner at optical, UV and X-ray wavelengths. Here we explore
the observational consequences if a modest fraction of the accretion power is
channeled into an ultra-relativistic outflow. We show that a relativistic jet
decelerates due to its interaction with the interstellar medium at sub-parsec
distances from the black hole. Synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated
by the reverse shock powers a bright radio-infrared transient that peaks on a
timescale ~1 yr after disruption. Emission from the forward shock may be
detectable for several years after the peak. Deep radio follow-up observations
of tidal disruption candidates at late times can test for the presence of
relativistic ejecta. Upcoming radio transient surveys may independently
discover tens to hundreds of tidal disruptions per year, complimenting searches
at other wavelengths. Non-thermal emission from tidal disruption probes the
physics of jet formation under relatively clean conditions, in which the flow
parameters are independently constrained.

A Chandra Observation of Supernova Remnant G350.1-0.3 and Its Central  Compact Object","
Abstract: We present a new Chandra observation of supernova remnant (SNR) G350.1-0.3.
The high resolution X-ray data reveal previously unresolved filamentary
structures and allow us to perform detailed spectroscopy in the diffuse regions
of this SNR. Spectral analysis demonstrates that the region of brightest
emission is dominated by hot, metal-rich ejecta while the ambient material
along the perimeter of the ejecta region and throughout the remnant's western
half is mostly low-temperature, shocked interstellar/circumstellar medium
(ISM/CSM) with solar-type composition. The data reveal that the emission
extends far to the west of the ejecta region and imply a lower limit of 6.6 pc
on the diameter of the source (at a distance of 4.5 kpc). We show that
G350.1-0.3 is likely in the free expansion (ejecta-dominated) stage and
calculate an age of 600-1200 years. The derived relationship between the shock
velocity and the electron/proton temperature ratio is found to be entirely
consistent with that of other SNRs. We perform spectral fits on the X-ray
source XMMU J172054.5-372652, a candidate central compact object (CCO), and
find that its spectral properties fall within the typical range of other CCOs.
We also present archival 24 um data of G350.1-0.3 taken with the Spitzer Space
Telescope during the MIPSGAL galactic survey and find that the infrared and
X-ray morphologies are well-correlated. These results help to explain this

X-1 the second example of bow shocks associated with HMXBs). The detection of
the bow shock implies that 4U 1907+09 is moving through the space with a high

Monitoring a high--amplitude Delta Sct star for 152 days: discovery of  12 additional modes and modulation effects in the light curve of CoRoT  101155310","
Abstract: The detection of small-amplitude nonradial modes in high-amplitude Delta Sct
(HADS) variables has been very elusive until at least five of them were
detected in the light curve of V974 Oph obtained from ground-based
observations. The combination of radial and nonradial modes has a high
asteroseismic potential, thanks to the strong constraints we can put in the
modelling. The continuous monitoring of ASAS 192647-0030.0=CoRoT 101155310
(P=0.1258 d, V=13.4) ensured from space by the CoRoT (Convection, Rotation and
planetary Transits) mission constitutes a unique opportunity to exploit such
potential. The 22270 CoRoT measurements were performed in the chromatic mode.
They span 152 d and cover 1208 consecutive cycles. After the correction for one
jump and the long-term drift, the level of the noise turned out to be 29
micromag. The phase shifts and amplitude ratios of the coloured CoRoT data, the
HARPS spectra, and the period-luminosity relation were used to determine a
self-consistent physical model. In turn, it allowed us to model the oscillation
spectrum, also giving feedback on the internal structure of the star. In
addition to the fundamental radial mode f1=7.949 c/d with harmonics up to 10f1,
we detected 12 independent terms. Linear combinations were also found and the
light curve was solved by means of 61 frequencies (smallest amplitude 0.10
mmag). The newest result is the detection of a periodic modulation of the f1
mode (triplets at +/-0.193 c/d centred on f1 and 2f1), discussed as a
rotational effect or as an extension of the Blazhko effect to HADS stars. The
physical model suggests that CoRoT 101155310 is an evolved star, with a slight
subsolar metallic abundance, close to the terminal age main sequence. All the
12 additional terms are identified with mixed modes in the predicted overstable
region.

and improve the constraints on the PQ axion using astrophysical objects

Accretion-induced luminosity spreads in young clusters: evidence from  stellar rotation","
Abstract: We present an analysis of the rotation of young stars in the associations
Cepheus OB3b, NGC 2264, NGC 2362 and the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We
discover a correlation between rotation rate and position in a colour-magnitude
diagram (CMD) such that stars which lie above an empirically determined median
pre-main sequence rotate more rapidly than stars which lie below this sequence.
The same correlation is seen, with a high degree of statistical significance,
in each association studied here. If position within the CMD is interpreted as
being due to genuine age spreads within a cluster, then the stars above the
median pre-main sequence would be the youngest stars. This would in turn imply
that the most rapidly rotating stars in an association are the youngest, and
hence those with the largest moments of inertia and highest likelihood of
ongoing accretion. Such a result does not fit naturally into the existing
picture of angular momentum evolution in young stars, where the stars are
braked effectively by their accretion discs until the disc disperses.
Instead, we argue that, for a given association of young stars, position
within the CMD is not primarily a function of age, but of accretion history. We
show that this hypothesis could explain the correlation we observe between
rotation rate and position within the CMD.

a survey area of 155 arcmin^2. The photometric data include U,B,F606W,F814W,J,K
bands. Morphologies are based on a by eye classification and we distinguish
between 3 basic classes: compact objects, targets with a disc and/or a bulge
component and irregular or merger candidates. The majority of our targets has
either a very compact morphology (33+-6%), or show more or less distinct disc
components (41+-6%). 14+-4% are merger or irregulars and 7 objects could not be
classified. We also study the dependence of structural parameters on
morphological appearance. EROs that are either compact or show a distinct bulge
component have smaller median effective radii (1.22+-0.14 kpc and 3.31+-0.53
kpc) than disc dominated (5.50+-0.51 kpc) or possible irregular galaxies or
merger candidates (4.92+-0.14 kpc). The Sersic index changes from 2.30+-0.34
and 3.24+-0.55, to 1.03+-0.24 and 1.54+-0.40 respectively.
Most the EROs in our sample have redshifts between z=1 and z=2; however,
compact EROs in our sample are found at redshifts as low as z=0.4 and as high
as z=2.8; the latter qualify as well as DRGs. Disc-like EROs are also found up
to z=2.8; however those with a bulge-disc structure are only seen at z<1.5. For
each of these EROs we determined the stellar mass and mean population age by
fitting synthetic Bruzual (2007) spectra to the SED. Mass estimates were
obtained by assuming an exponentially declining star formation rate. Total
stellar masses are in the range 9.1<log(M/M_sun)<11.6. We cannot detect
significant differences between the stellar mass distribution of the
morphological classes. EROs with masses of log(M/M_sun)>11.0 dominantly show
compact morphologies, but also include a significant number of sources with a
disc morphology.

distribution with better than 95 per cent confidence probability. The Lupus,
Upper Scorpius A and Taurus--Auriga populations are shown to be compatible with
being drawn from the same initial period function (IPF), which is inconsistent
with the main sequence data. Two possible IPF forms are used to find parent
distributions to various permutations of the available data which include Upper
Scorpius B (UScB), Chameleon and Orion Nebula Cluster pre-main sequence
samples. All the pre-main sequence samples studied here are consistent with the
hypothesis that there exists a universal IPF which is modified through
binary-star disruption if it forms in an embedded star cluster leading to a
general decline of the observed period function with increasing period. The
pre-main sequence data admit a log-normal IPF similar to that arrived at by
Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) for main sequence stars, provided the binary fraction
among pre-main sequence stars is significantly higher. But, for consistency
with proto-stellar data, the possibly universal IPF ought to be flat in log-P
or log-semi-major axis and must be similar to the K1 IPF form derived through
inverse dynamical population synthesis, which has been shown to lead to the
main sequence period function if most stars form in typical embedded clusters.

INTEGRAL results on gamma-ray bursts and soft gamma-ray repeaters","
Abstract: Despite not being specifically designed for the study of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs), the INTEGRAL satellite is giving a relevant contribution to this field
with the detection of about 10 GRB per year in the IBIS field of view. The
ground-based INTEGRAL Burst Alert System (IBAS) has provided real-time
localizations with 2-3 arcmin accuracy for most of these events. The INTEGRAL
sample now comprises 81 bursts, including 4 of the short class. IBAS has also
revealed other transient events from various classes of Galactic sources, most
notably short bursts and flares from magnetar candidates. Here I present a
summary of the IBAS performances in the eight years since the INTEGRAL launch
and review some of the INTEGRAL results for GRBs and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters.

Luminous Satellites of Early-Type Galaxies I: Spatial Distribution","
Abstract: We study the spatial distribution of faint satellites of intermediate
redshift (0.1<z<0.8), early-type galaxies, selected from the GOODS fields. We
combine high resolution HST images and state-of-the-art host subtraction
techniques to detect satellites of unprecedented faintness and proximity to
intermediate redshift host galaxies (up to 5.5 magnitudes fainter and as close
as 0.""5/2.5 kpc to the host centers). We model the spatial distribution of
objects near the hosts as a combination of an isotropic, homogenous
background/foreground population and a satellite population with a power law
radial profile and an elliptical angular distribution. We detect a significant
population of satellites, Ns =1.7 (+0.9,-0.8) that is comparable to the number
of Milky Way satellites with similar host-satellite contrast.The average
projected radial profile of the satellite distribution is isothermal, gamma_p=
-1.0(+0.3,-0.4), which is consistent with the observed central mass density
profile of massive early-type galaxies. Furthermore, the satellite distribution
is highly anisotropic (isotropy is ruled out at a >99.99% confidence level).
Defining phi to be the offset between the major axis of the satellite spatial
distribution and the major axis of the host light profile, we find a maximum
posterior probability of phi = 0 and |phi| less than 42 degrees at the 68%
confidence level. The alignment of the satellite distribution with the light of
the host is consistent with simulations, assuming that light traces mass for
the host galaxy as observed for lens galaxies. The anisotropy of the satellite
population enhances its ability to produce the flux ratio anomalies observed in
gravitationally lensed quasars.

"Title:
Simulated evolution of the dark matter large-scale structure","
Abstract: We analyze evolution of the basic properties of simulated large scale
structure elements formed by dark matter (DM LSS) and confront it with the
observed evolution of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. In three high resolution
simulations we selected samples of compact DM clouds of moderate overdensity.
Clouds are selected at redshifts $0\leq z\leq 3$ with the Minimal Spanning Tree
(MST) technique. The main properties of so selected clouds are analyzed in 3D
space and with the core sampling approach, what allows us to compare estimates
of the DM LSS evolution obtained with two different techniques and to clarify
some important aspects of the LSS evolution. In both cases we find that regular
redshift variations of the mean characteristics of the DM LSS are accompanied
only by small variations of their PDFs, what indicates the self similar
character of the DM LSS evolution. The high degree of relaxation of DM
particles compressed within the LSS is found along the shortest principal axis
of clouds. We see that the internal structure of selected clouds depends upon
the mass resolution and scale of perturbations achieved in simulations. It is
found that the low mass tail of the PDFs of the LSS characteristics depends
upon the procedure of clouds selection.

"Title:
Gamma-ray Emission from the Vela Pulsar Modeled with the Annular Gap and  Core Gap","
Abstract: The Vela pulsar represents a distinct group of {\gamma}-ray pulsars. Fermi
{\gamma}-ray observations reveal that it has two sharp peaks (P1 and P2) in the
light curve with a phase separation of 0.42 and a third peak (P3) in the
bridge. The location and intensity of P3 are energy-dependent. We use the 3D
magnetospheric model for the annular gap and core gap to simulate the
{\gamma}-ray light curves, phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra. We found
that the acceleration electric field along a field line in the annular gap
region decreases with heights. The emission at high energy GeV band is
originated from the curvature radiation of accelerated primary particles, while
the synchrotron radiation from secondary particles have some contributions to
low energy {\gamma}-ray band (0.1 - 0.3 GeV). The {\gamma}-ray light curve
peaks P1 and P2 are generated in the annular gap region near the altitude of
null charge surface, whereas P3 and the bridge emission is generated in the
core gap region. The intensity and location of P3 at different energy bands
depend on the emission altitudes. The radio emission from the Vela pulsar
should be generated in a high-altitude narrow regions of the annular gap, which
leads to a radio phase lag of ~ 0.13 prior to the first {\gamma}-ray peak.

"Title:
Long-Term evolution of Discs around Magnetic Stars","
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of a thin viscous disc surrounding magnetic
star, including the spindown of the star by the magnetic torques it exerts on
the disc. The transition from an accreting to a non-accreting state, and the
change of the magnetic torque across the corotation radius are included in a
generic way, the widths of the transition taken in the range suggested by
numerical simulations. In addition to the standard accreting state, two more
are found. An accreting state can develop into a 'dead' disc state, with inner
edge well outside corotation. More often, a 'trapped' state develops, in which
the inner disc edge stays close to corotation even at very low accretion rates.
The long-term evolution of these two states is different. In the dead state the
star spins down incompletely, retaining much of its initial spin. In the
trapped state the star asymptotically can spin down to arbitarily low rates,
its angular momentum transferred to the disc. We identify these outcomes with
respectively the rapidly rotating and the very slowly rotating classes of Ap
stars and magnetic white dwarfs.

"Title:
Binaries discovered by the SPY survey VI. Discovery of a low mass  companion to the hot subluminous planetary nebula central star EGB\,5 - A  recently ejected common envelope?","
Abstract: Hot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) in close binary systems are assumed to be formed
via common envelope ejection. According to theoretical models, the amount of
energy and angular momentum deposited in the common envelope scales with the
mass of the companion. That low mass companions near or below the core
hydrogen-burning limit are able to trigger the ejection of this envelope is
well known. The currently known systems have very short periods
$\simeq0.1-0.3\,{\rm d}$. Here we report the discovery of a low mass companion
($M_{\rm 2}>0.14\,M_{\rm \odot}$) orbiting the sdB star and central star of a
planetary nebula EGB\,5 with an orbital period of $16.5\,{\rm d}$ at a minimum
separation of $23\,R_{\rm \odot}$. Its long period is only just consistent with
the energy balance prescription of the common envelope. The marked difference
between the short and long period systems will provide strong constraints on
the common envelope phase, in particular if the masses of the sdB stars can be
measured accurately. Due to selection effects, the fraction of sdBs with low
mass companions and similar or longer periods may be quite high. Low mass
stellar and substellar companions may therefore play a significant role for the
still unclear formation of hot subdwarf stars. Furthermore, the nebula around
EGB\,5 may be the remnant of the ejected common envelope making this binary a
unique system to study this short und poorly understood phase of binary
evolution.

"Title:
The Fermi Gamma-Ray Haze from Dark Matter Annihilations and Anisotropic  Diffusion","
Abstract: Recent full-sky maps of the Galaxy from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope
have revealed a diffuse component of emission towards the Galactic center and
extending up to roughly +/-50 degrees in latitude. This Fermi ""haze"" is the
inverse Compton emission generated by the same electrons which generate the
microwave synchrotron haze at WMAP wavelengths. The gamma-ray haze has two
distinct characteristics: the spectrum is significantly harder than emission
elsewhere in the Galaxy and the morphology is elongated in latitude with
respect to longitude with an axis ratio ~2. If these electrons are generated
through annihilations of dark matter particles in the Galactic halo, this
morphology is difficult to realize with a standard spherical halo and isotropic
cosmic-ray diffusion. However, we show that anisotropic diffusion along ordered
magnetic field lines towards the center of the Galaxy coupled with a prolate
dark matter halo can easily yield the required morphology without making
unrealistic assumptions about diffusion parameters. Furthermore, a Sommerfeld
enhancement to the self annihilation cross-section of ~30 yields a good fit to
the morphology, amplitude, and spectrum of both the gamma-ray and microwave
haze. The model is also consistent with local cosmic-ray measurements as well
as CMB constraints.

discrepancy among models, respectively), in good agreement with the cluster's

Catching GRBs with atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes","
Abstract: Fermi has shown GRBs to be a source of >10 GeV photons. We present an
estimate of the detection rate of GRBs with a next generation Cherenkov

determinations for the bursts population by instruments operating at lower

instruments thus far, our results suggest that ground-based detection may be
within reach of the proposed Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), albeit with a low
rate, 0.25 - 0.5/yr. Such a detection would help constrain the emission
mechanism of gamma-ray emission from GRBs. Photons at these energies from

Modeling SN 1996cr's X-ray lines at high-resolution: Sleuthing the  ejecta/CSM geometry","
Abstract: SN 1996cr, located in the Circinus Galaxy (3.7 Mpc, z ~ 0.001) was
non-detected in X-rays at ~ 1000 days yet brightened to ~ 4 x 10^{39} erg/s
(0.5-8 keV) after 10 years (Bauer et al. 2008). A 1-D hydrodynamic model of the
ejecta-CSM interaction produces good agreement with the measured X-ray light
curves and spectra at multiple epochs. We conclude that the progenitor of SN
1996cr could have been a massive star, M > 30 M_solar, which went from an RSG
to a brief W-R phase before exploding within its ~ 0.04 pc wind-blown shell
(Dwarkadas et al. 2010). Further analysis of the deep Chandra HETG observations
allows line-shape fitting of a handful of bright Si and Fe lines in the
spectrum. The line shapes are well fit by axisymmetric emission models with an
axis orientation ~ 55 degrees to our line-of-sight. In the deep 2009 epoch the
higher ionization Fe XXVI emission is constrained to high lattitudes: the
Occam-est way to get the Fe H-like emission coming from high latitude/polar
regions is to have more CSM at/around the poles than at mid and lower
lattitudes, along with a symmetric ejecta explosion/distribution. Similar
CSM/ejecta characterization may be possible for other SNe and, with
higher-throughput X-ray observations, for gamma-ray burst remnants as well.

Detection of the detached dust shell of U Antliae at mid-infrared  wavelengths with AKARI/IRC","
Abstract: We report mid-infrared (MIR) imaging observations of the carbon star U Ant
made with the Infrared Camera (IRC) on board AKARI. Subtraction of the
artifacts and extended PSF of the central star reveals the detached dust shell
around the carbon star at MIR wavelengths (15 and 24{\mu}m) for the first time.
The observed radial brightness profiles of the MIR emission are well explained
by two shells at 43"" and 50"" from the central star detected in optical
scattered light observations. Combining Herschel/PACS, AKARI/FIS, and AKARI/IRC
data, we obtain the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of the thermal
emission from the detached shell of U Ant in a wide infrared spectral range of
15- 160 {\mu}m. Thermal emission of amorphous carbon grains with a single
temperature cannot account for the observed SED from 15 to 160 {\mu}m: it
underestimates the emission at 15 {\mu}m. Alternatively, the observed SED is
fitted by the model that amorphous carbon grains in the two shells have
different temperatures of 60 and 104 K, which allocates most dust mass in the
shell at 50"". This supports previous suggestion that the 43"" shell is gas-rich
and the 50"" one is dust-rich. We suggest a possibility that the segregation of
the gas and dust resulting from the drift motion of submicron-sized dust grains
relative to the gas and that the hot dust component associated with the
gas-rich shell is composed of very small grains that are strongly coupled with
the gas.

Center-limb dependence of photospheric velocities in regions of emerging  magnetic fields on the Sun","
Abstract: We investigate the ratio of the vertical and horizontal velocities of the

We carried out a study of photospheric velocities during the first hours of the
appearance of 83 active regions with magnetic flux more than 10^21 Mx with data
acquired by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and

distances from the solar disk center. We found that the values of maximum
negative Doppler velocities that accompany the emergence of active region
magnetic fields during the first 12 hours increase nonlinearly with the
heliocentric angle. This result shows that the horizontal photospheric
velocities of plasma outflows are higher than the vertical ones of the plasma
upflows during the first hours of the emergence of active regions. The
horizontal velocity component at the site of emerging active regions exceeds
that of convective flows in the quiet Sun. A comparison between the velocities
and the maximum value of the total magnetic flux has not revealed any relation.

Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Neutron Star r-mode  Instability Revisited","
Abstract: We revisit the possibility and detectability of a stochastic gravitational
wave background (SGWB) produced by a cosmological population of newborn neutron
stars (NSs) with r-mode instabilities. We show that the resultant SGWB is
insensitive to the choice of CSFR models, but depends strongly on the evolving
behavior of CSFR at low redshifts. Our results show that the dimensionless
energy density $\Omega_{\rm{GW}}$ could have a peak amplitude of $\simeq
(1-3.5) \times10^{-8}$ in the frequency range $(200-1000)$~Hz. However, such a
high mode amplitude is unrealistic as it is known that the maximum value is
much smaller and at most $10^{-2}$. A realistic estimate of $\Omega_{\rm{GW}}$
should be at least 4 orders of magnitude lower ($\sim 10^{-12}$), which leads
to a pessimistic outlook for the detection of r-mode background. We consider
different pairs of terrestrial interferometers (IFOs) and compare two
approaches to combine multiple IFOs in order to evaluate the detectability of
this GW background. Constraints on the total emitted GW energy associated with
this mechanism to produce a detectable stochastic background are $\sim 10^{-3}
M_{\odot} c^2$ for two co-located advanced LIGO detectors, and $2 \times
10^{-5} M_{\odot} c^2$ for two Einstein Telescopes. These constraints may also
be applicable to alternative GW emission mechanisms related to oscillations or
instabilities in NSs depending on the frequency band where most GWs are

XMM-Newton observations of the low-mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 in  quiescence","
Abstract: The neutron star low-mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 started a transition from
outburst to quiescence in August 2008, after more than 24 years of continuous
accretion. The return of the source to quiescence has been monitored
extensively by several X-ray observatories. Here, we report on four XMM-Newton
observations elapsing a period of more than 19 months and starting in November
2008. The X-ray spectra show a soft thermal component which we fit with a
neutron star atmosphere model. Only in the first observation do we find a
significant second component above ~ 3 keV accounting for ~ 7 % of the total
flux, which could indicate residual accretion. The thermal bolometric flux and
the temperature of the neutron star crust decrease steadily by 40 and 10 %
respectively between the first and the fourth observation. At the time of the
last observation, June 2010, we obtain a thermal bolometric luminosity of 5.6 x
10$^{33}$ (d/7.1 kpc)$^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a temperature of the neutron star
crust of 109 eV. The cooling curve is consistent with a relatively hot,
medium-mass neutron star, cooling by standard mechanisms. From the spectral
fits to a neutron star atmosphere model we infer limits for the mass and the
radius of the neutron star. We find that in order to achieve self-consistency
for the NS mass between the different methods, the value of the distance is
constrained to be <~6 kpc. For this value of the distance, the derived mass and
radius contours are consistent with a number of EoSs with nucleons and
hyperons.

Abstract: We investigate the effects of AGN feedback on the colour evolution of

the lobes of powerful Fanaroff-Riley type II (edge-brightened) sources show
much redder colours than neighbouring galaxies that are not spatially
coincident with the radio source. By contrast, no similar effect is seen near
Fanaroff-Riley type I (core-dominated) radio sources. We show that these
colours are consistent with FR-IIs truncating star formation as the expanding
bow shock overruns a galaxy. We examine a sample of clusters with no detectable

of past AGN feedback. AGN activity in the low-redshift Universe is
predominantly driven by low-luminosity radio sources with short duty cycles.
Our results show that, despite their rarity, feedback from powerful radio
sources is an important driver of galaxy evolution even in the local volume.

Acceleration, magnetic fluctuations and cross-field transport of  energetic electrons in a solar flare loop","
Abstract: Plasma turbulence is thought to be associated with various physical processes
involved in solar flares, including magnetic reconnection, particle
acceleration and transport. Using Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
({\it RHESSI}) observations and the X-ray visibility analysis, we determine the
spatial and spectral distributions of energetic electrons for a flare (GOES
M3.7 class, April 14, 2002 23$:$55 UT), which was previously found to be
consistent with a reconnection scenario. It is demonstrated that because of the
high density plasma in the loop, electrons have to be continuously accelerated
about the loop apex of length $\sim 2\times 10^9$cm and width $\sim 7\times
10^8$cm. Energy dependent transport of tens of keV electrons is observed to
occur both along and across the guiding magnetic field of the loop. We show
that the cross-field transport is consistent with the presence of magnetic
turbulence in the loop, where electrons are accelerated, and estimate the
magnitude of the field line diffusion coefficient for different phases of the
flare. The energy density of magnetic fluctuations is calculated for given
magnetic field correlation lengths and is larger than the energy density of the
non-thermal electrons. The level of magnetic fluctuations peaks when the
largest number of electrons is accelerated and is below detectability or absent
at the decay phase. These hard X-ray observations provide the first
observational evidence that magnetic turbulence governs the evolution of
energetic electrons in a dense flaring loop and is suggestive of their
turbulent acceleration.

Abstract: Post-AGB stars are key objects for the study of the dramatic morphological

growing evidences that binary interaction processes may very well have a

evidence is still weak. We aim at a systematic study of the dust distribution

the inner part of these evolved stars to probe direct emission from dusty

Polytropic configurations with non-zero cosmological constant","
Abstract: We solve the equation of the equilibrium of the gravitating body, with a
polytropic equation of state of the matter $P=K\rho^{\gamma}$, with
$\gamma=1+1/n$, in the frame of the Newtonian gravity, with non-zero
cosmological constant $\Lambda$. We consider the cases with $n=1,\,\,1.5,\,\,3$
and construct series of solutions with a fixed value of $\Lambda$. For each
value of $n$, the non-dimensional equation of the static equilibrium has a
family of solutions, instead of the unique solution of the Lane-Emden equation
at $\Lambda=0$. The equilibrium state exists only for central densities
$\rho_0$ larger than the critical value $\rho_c$. There are no static solutions
at $\rho_0 < \rho_c$. We find the values of $\rho_c$ for each value of $n$ and
show that the presence of dark energy decrease the dynamic stability of the
configuration. We apply our results for analyzing the possibility of existence
of equilibrium states for cluster of galaxies in the present universe with
non-zero $\Lambda$.

"Title:
Multicomponent theory of buoyancy instabilities in magnetized plasmas:  The case of magnetic field parallel to gravity","
Abstract: We investigate electromagnetic buoyancy instabilities of the electron-ion
plasma with the heat flux based on not the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations,
but using the multicomponent plasma approach when the momentum equations are
solved for each species. We consider a geometry in which the background
magnetic field, gravity, and stratification are directed along one axis. The
nonzero background electron thermal flux is taken into account. Collisions
between electrons and ions are included in the momentum equations. No
simplifications usual for the one-fluid MHD-approach in studying these
instabilities are used. We derive a simple dispersion relation, which shows
that the thermal flux perturbation generally stabilizes an instability for the
geometry under consideration. This result contradicts to conclusion obtained in
the MHD-approach. We show that the reason of this contradiction is the
simplified assumptions used in the MHD analysis of buoyancy instabilities and
the role of the longitudinal electric field perturbation which is not captured
by the ideal MHD equations. Our dispersion relation also shows that the medium
with the electron thermal flux can be unstable, if the temperature gradients of
ions and electrons have the opposite signs. The results obtained can be applied
to the weakly collisional magnetized plasma objects in laboratory and
astrophysics.

Abundances of PAHs in the ISM: Confronting Observations with  Experimental Results","
Abstract: We present recent UV laboratory spectra of various polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and explore the potential of these molecules as carriers of
the DIBs. From a detailed comparison of gas-phase and Ne-matrix absorption
spectra of anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, 2,3-benzofluorene,
benzo[ghi]perylene, and hexabenzocoronene with new interstellar spectra, we
infer upper limits in the abundance of these PAHs in the interstellar medium.
Upper limits in the column densities of anthracene of $0.8 - 2.8 \times
10^{12}$\ cm$^{-2}$ and of pyrene and 2,3-benzofluorene ranging from $2 - 8
\times 10^{12}$\ cm$^{-2}$ are inferred. Upper limits in the column densities
of benzo[ghi]perylene are $0.9 - 2.4 \times 10^{13}$ and $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$
for phenanthrene. The measurements indicate fractional abundances of
anthracene, pyrene, and 2,3-benzofluorene of a few times $10^{-10}$. Upper
limits in the fractional abundance of benzo[ghi]perylene of a few times
$10^{-9}$ and of phenanthrene of few times $10^{-8}$ are inferred. {Toward CPD
$-32^\circ 1734$, we found near 3584 {\AA} an absorption line of OH$^+$, which
was discovered in the interstellar medium only very recently.
The fractional abundances of PAHs inferred here are up to two orders of
magnitude lower than estimated total PAH abundances in the interstellar medium.
This indicates that either neutral PAHs are not abundant in translucent
molecular clouds, or that a PAH population with a large variety of molecules is
present.

"Title:
Stability of quasi-Keplerian shear flow in a laboratory experiment","
Abstract: Context: Subcritical transition to turbulence has been proposed as a source
of turbulent viscosity required for the associated angular momentum transport
for fast accretion in Keplerian disks. Previously cited laboratory experiments
in supporting this hypothesis were performed either in a different type of flow
than Keplerian or without quantitative measurements of angular momentum
transport and mean flow profile, and all of them appear to suffer from Ekman
effects, secondary flows induced by nonoptimal axial boundary conditions. Such
Ekman effects are expected to be absent from astronomical disks, which probably
have stress-free vertical boundaries unless strongly magnetized. Aims: To
quantify angular momentum transport due to subcritical hydrodynamic turbulence,
if exists, in a quasi-Keplerian flow with minimized Ekman effects. Methods: We
perform a local measurement of the azimuthal--radial component of the Reynolds
stress tensor in a novel laboratory apparatus where Ekman effects are minimized
by flexible control of axial boundary conditions. Results: We find significant
Ekman effects on angular momentum transport due to nonoptimal axial boundary
conditions in quasi-Keplerian flows. With the optimal control of Ekman effects,
no statistically meaningful angular momentum transport is detected in such
flows at Reynolds number up to two millions. Conclusions: Either a subcritical
transition does not occur, or, if a subcritical transition does occur, the
associated radial transport of angular momentum in optimized quasi-Keplerian
laboratory flows is too small to directly support the hypothesis that
subcritical hydrodynamic turbulence is responsible for accretion in
astrophysical disks. Possible limitations in applying laboratory results to
astrophysical disks due to experimental geometry are discussed.

Rest-frame ultraviolet-to-optical spectral characteristics of extremely  metal-poor and metal-free galaxies","
Abstract: Finding the first generation of galaxies in the early Universe is the
greatest step forward for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. For
strategic survey of such galaxies and interpretation of the obtained data, this
paper presents an ultraviolet-to-optical spectral model of galaxies with a
great care of the nebular emission. In particular, we present a
machine-readable table of intensities of 119 nebular emission lines from
Ly$\alpha$ to the rest-frame 1 $\mu$m as a function of metallicity from zero to
the Solar one. Based on the spectral model, we present criteria of equivalent
widths of Ly$\alpha$, He {\sc ii} $\lambda1640$, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O {\sc
iii}] $\lambda5007$ to select extremely metal-poor and metal-free galaxies
although these criteria have uncertainty caused by the Lyman continuum escape
fraction and the star formation duration. We also present criteria of
broad-band colours which will be useful to select candidates for spectroscopic
follow-up from drop-out galaxies. We propose the line intensity ratio of [O
{\sc iii}] $\lambda5007$ to H$\beta$ $<0.1$ as the most robust criterion for
$<1/1000$ of the Solar metallicity. This ratio of a galaxy with a few $M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ at $z\sim8$ is detectable by spectroscopy with the James Webb Space
Telescope within a reasonable exposure time.

A High-Metallicity High Velocity Cloud along the MRK 421 Sight Line: A  Tracer of Complex M?","
Abstract: We present a new measurement, 0.85-3.5 Z_solar, of the metallicity of high
velocity cloud (HVC) Complex M by analyzing ultraviolet spectroscopic
observations of the blazar Mrk 421 taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
on the Hubble Space Telescope and the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer.
Although an HVC at V_LSR = -131 km/s is not visible in 21 cm emission
(logN_HI<18.38; 3sigma), it is detected in ultraviolet absorption lines of C
II, N I, O I, O VI, Si II, Si III, Si IV, Fe II, and HI. By referencing
velocities to the intermediate velocity cloud at -60 km/s and jointly analyzing
HI absorption from high-order HI Lyman lines, we measure
logN_HI=16.84(0.13,+0.34) (1sigma) in the HVC. Comparing HI, and O I, we find
an HVC metallicity [O/H]=0.32(-0.39, +0.22). Because the sight line passes 4
degrees from the HVCs in Complex M, the detected HVC may represent the highest
velocity component of the Complex, and our measurements provide a lower limit
to its metallicity. The high, possibly super-solar metallicity, together with
the low distance, z<3.5 kpc, above the Galactic plane suggest that Complex M is
condensed returning gas from a Galactic fountain.

Mass, Light and Colour of the Cosmic Web in the Supercluster  SCL2243-0935 (z=0.447)","
Abstract: Context: In 2.2m MPG-ESO/WFI data we discovered several mass peaks through
weak lensing, forming a possible supercluster at redshift 0.45. Through
multi-colour wide-field imaging with CFHT/Megaprime and INT/WFC we identify
early-type galaxies and trace the supercluster network with them. Through
EMMI/NTT multi-object spectroscopy we verify the initial shear-selected cluster
candidates. Using weak lensing we obtain mass estimates for the supercluster
centre and the filaments.
Results: We identified the centre of the SCL2243-0935 supercluster, MACS
J2243-0935, which was found independently by Ebeling et al. (2010). 13 more
clusters or overdensities are embedded in a filamentary network, half of them
are already spectroscopically confirmed. Three (5-15) Mpc filaments are
detected, and we estimate the global size of SCL2243 to 45x15x50 Mpc, making it
one of the largest superclusters known at intermediate redshifts. Weak lensing
yields r_200=(2.06+/-0.13) Mpc and M_200=(1.54+/-0.29)x10^15 M_sun for MACS
J2243 with M/L=428+/-82, very similar to results from size-richness cluster
scaling relations. Integrating the weak lensing surface mass density over the
supercluster network (defined by increased i-band luminosity or g-i colours),
we find (1.53+/-1.01)x10^15 M_sun and M/L=305+/-201 for the three main
filaments, consistant with theoretical predictions. The filaments' projected
surface mass density is 0.007-0.012, corresponding to 10-100 times the critical
density. The greatly varying density of the cosmic web is also reflected in the
mean colour of galaxies. Conclusions: SCL2243 is significantly larger and much
more richly structured than other known superclusters such as A901/902 or
MS0302 studied with weak lensing before. It is a text-book supercluster with
little contamination along the line of sight, making it a perfect sandbox for
testing new techniques probing the cosmic web.

"Title:
3-D simulations of shells around massive stars","
Abstract: As massive stars evolve, their winds change. This causes a series of
hydrodynamical interactions in the surrounding medium. Whenever a fast wind
follows a slow wind phase, the fast wind sweeps up the slow wind in a shell,
which can be observed as a circumstellar nebula.
One of the most striking examples of such an interaction is when a massive
star changes from a red supergiant into a Wolf-Rayet star. Nebulae resulting
from such a transition have been observed around many Wolf-Rayet stars and show
detailed, complicated structures owing to local instabilities in the swept-up
shells.
Shells also form in the case of massive binary stars, where the winds of two
stars collide with one another. Along the collision front gas piles up, forming
a shell that rotates along with the orbital motion of the binary stars. In this
case the shell follows the surface along which the ram pressure of the two
colliding winds is in balance.
Using the MPI-AMRVAC hydrodynamics code we have made multi-dimensional
simulations of these interactions in order to model the formation and evolution
of these circumstellar nebulae and explore whether full 3D simulations are
necessary to obtain accurate models of such nebulae.

"Title:
Cosmological production of noncommutative black holes","
Abstract: We investigate the pair creation of noncommutative black holes in a
background with positive cosmological constant. As a first step we derive the
noncommutative geometry inspired Schwarzschild deSitter solution. By varying
the mass and the cosmological constant parameters, we find several spacetimes
compatible with the new solution: positive mass spacetimes admit one
cosmological horizon and two, one or no black hole horizons, while negative
mass spacetimes have just a cosmological horizon. These new black holes share
the properties of the corresponding asymptotically flat solutions, including
the non-singular core and thermodynamic stability in the final phase of the
evaporation. As a second step we determine the action which generates the
matter sector of gravitational field equations and we construct instantons
describing the pair production of black holes and the other admissible
topologies. As a result we find that for current values of the cosmological
constant the deSitter background is quantum mechanically stable according to
experience. However positive mass noncommutative black holes and solitons would
have plentifully been produced during inflationary times for Planckian values
of the cosmological constant. As a special result we find that, in these early
epochs of the universe, Planck size black holes production would have been
largely disfavoured. We also find a potential instability for production of
negative-mass solitons.

Turbulence production and turbulent pressure support in the  intergalactic medium","
Abstract: The injection and evolution of turbulence in the intergalactic medium is
studied by means of mesh-based hydrodynamical simulations, including a subgrid
scale (SGS) model for small-scale unresolved turbulence. The simulations show
that the production of turbulence has a different redshift dependence in the
intracluster medium (ICM) and the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). We show
that turbulence in the ICM is produced chiefly by merger-induced shear flows,
whereas the production in the WHIM is dominated by shock interactions.
Secondly, the effect of dynamical pressure support on the gravitational
contraction has been studied. This turbulent support is stronger in the WHIM
gas at baryon overdensities 1 < delta < 100, and less relevant for the ICM.
Although the relative mass fraction of the gas with large vorticity is
considerable (52% in the ICM), we find that for only about 10% in mass this is
dynamically relevant, namely not associated to an equally large thermal
pressure support. According to this result, a significant non-thermal pressure
support counteracting the gravitational contraction is a localised
characteristic in the cosmic flow, rather than a widespread feature.

employed to construct a radial velocity curve with a semi-amplitude of $22.1

this provides a dynamically determined neutron star mass of $1.42 \pm 0.26
M$_{\odot}$ and a mass of $14.3 \pm 0.8 M$_{\odot}$ for the Ofpe/WN9 highly
evolved donor star. OAO 1657-415 is an eclipsing High Mass X-ray binary pulsar
with the largest eccentricity and orbital period of any within its class. Of
the ten known eclipsing X-ray binary pulsars OAO 1657-415 becomes the ninth
with a dynamically determined neutron star mass solution and only the second in
an eccentric system. Furthermore, the donor star in OAO 1657-415 is much more
highly evolved than the majority of the supergiant donors in other High Mass
X-ray binaries (HMXBs), joining a small but growing list of HMXBs donors with
extensive hydrogen depleted atmospheres. Considering the evolutionary
development of OAO 1657-415, we have estimated the binding energy of the
envelope of the mass donor and find that there is insufficient energy for the
removal of the donor's envelope via spiral-in, ruling out a Common Envelope
evolutionary scenario. With its non-zero eccentricity and relatively large
orbital period the identification of a definitive evolutionary pathway for

Properties of fossil groups in cosmological simulations and galaxy  formation models","
Abstract: It has been a long-standing question whether fossil groups are just sampling
the tail of the distribution of ordinary groups, or whether they are a
physically distinct class of objects, characterized by an unusual and special
formation history. To study this question, we here investigate fossil groups
identified in the hydrodynamical simulations of the GIMIC project, which
consists of resimulations of five regions in the Millennium Simulation (MS)
that are characterized by different large-scale densities, ranging from a deep
void to a proto-cluster region. For comparison, we also consider semi-analytic
models built on top of the MS, as well as a conditional luminosity function
approach. We identify galaxies in the GIMIC simulations as groups of stars and
use a spectral synthesis code to derive their optical properties. The X-ray
luminosity of the groups is estimated in terms of the thermal bremsstrahlung
emission of the gas in the host halos, neglecting metallicity effects. We focus
on comparing the properties of fossil groups in the theoretical models and
observational results, highlighting the differences between them, and trying to
identify possible dependencies on environment for which our approach is
particularly well set-up. We find that the optical fossil fraction in all of
our theoretical models declines with increasing halo mass, and there is no
clear environmental dependence. Combining the optical and X-ray selection
criteria for fossil groups, the halo mass dependence of the fossil groups seen
in optical vanishes. Over the GIMIC halo mass range we resolve best,
9.0\times1012 \sim 4.0\times1013 h-1 M, the central galaxies in the fossil
groups show similar properties as those in ordinary groups, in terms of age,

this relationship and the observed anti-correlation, we estimate the height and
vertical extent of the acceleration region, giving values of around 50 Mm and
10 Mm respectively. The inferred acceleration height and size suggests that
electrons are accelerated well above the soft X-ray loop-top, which could be
consistent with the electron acceleration between 40 Mm and 60 Mm above the
flaring loop.

The GALEX Ultraviolet Virgo Cluster Survey (GUViCS). I: The UV  luminosity function of the central 12 sq.deg","
Abstract: The GALEX Ultraviolet Virgo Cluster Survey (GUViCS) is a complete blind
survey of the Virgo cluster covering about 40 sq. deg. in the far UV (FUV,
lambda_eff=1539A, Delta-lambda=442A) and about 120 sq. deg. in the near UV
(NUV, lambda_eff=2316A, Delta-lambda=1060A). The goal of the survey is to study
the ultraviolet (UV) properties of galaxies in a rich cluster environment,
spanning a wide luminosity range from giants to dwarfs, and regardless of prior
knowledge of their star formation activity. The UV data will be combined with
those in other bands (optical: NGVS; far-infrared - submm: HeViCS; HI: ALFALFA)
and with our multizone chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution to
make a complete and exhaustive study of the effects of the environment on the
evolution of galaxies in high density regions. We present here the scientific
objectives of the survey, describing the observing strategy and briefly
discussing different data reduction techniques. Using UV data already in-hand
for the central 12 sq. deg. we determine the FUV and NUV luminosity functions
of the Virgo cluster core for all cluster members and separately for early- and
late-type galaxies and compare it to the one obtained in the field and other
nearby clusters (Coma, A1367). This analysis shows that the FUV and NUV
luminosity functions of the core of the Virgo clusters are flatter (alpha about
-1.1) than those determined in Coma and A1367. We discuss the possible origin
of this difference

"Title:
Narrowband imaging of Escaping Lyman-Continuum Emission in the SSA22  Field","
Abstract: We present the results of an ultradeep, narrowband imaging survey for
Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission at z~3 in the SSA22a field. We employ a custom
narrowband filter centered at 3640A (NB3640), which probes the LyC region for
galaxies at z>3.06. We also analyze new and archival NB4980 imaging tuned to
the wavelength of the Lya emission line at z=3.09, and archival broadband B, V,
and R images of the non-ionizing UV continuum. Our NB3640 images contain 26
z>3.06 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) as well as a set of 130 Lya emitters (LAEs),
identified by their excess NB4980 flux relative to the BV continuum. Six LBGs
and 28 LAEs are detected in the NB3640 image. LBGs appear to span a range of
NB3640-R colors, while LAEs appear bimodal in their NB3640-R properties. We
estimate average UV to LyC flux density ratios, corrected for foreground
contamination and intergalactic medium absorption, finding
<F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LBG} = 11.3^{+10.3}_{-5.4}, which implies a LBG LyC escape
fraction f_{esc}^{LyC} ~ 0.1, and <F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LAE} = 2.2^{+0.9}_{-0.6}.
The strikingly blue LAE flux density ratios defy interpretation in terms of
standard stellar population models. Assuming <F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LBG} applies
down to L=0.1L*, we estimate a galaxy contribution to the intergalactic
hydrogen ionization rate that is consistent with independent estimates based on
the Lya forest opacity at z~3. If we assume that <F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LAE} holds
at the faintest luminosities, the galaxy contribution significantly exceeds
that inferred from the Lya forest. Further follow-up study of these faint LAEs
is crucial, given the potentially important contribution similar objects make
to the process of reionization. (Abridged)

A Novel Test of the Modified Newtonian Dynamics with Gas Rich Galaxies","
Abstract: The current cosmological paradigm, LCDM, requires that the mass-energy of the
universe be dominated by invisible components: dark matter and dark energy. An
alternative to these dark components is that the law of gravity be modified on
the relevant scales. A test of these ideas is provided by the Baryonic
Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR), an empirical relation between the observed mass
of a galaxy and its rotation velocity. Here I report a test using gas rich
galaxies for which both axes of the BTFR can be measured independently of the
theories being tested and without the systematic uncertainty in stellar mass
that affects the same test with star dominated spirals. The data fall precisely
where predicted a priori by the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). The scatter
in the BTFR is attributable entirely to observational uncertainty. This is
consistent with the action of a single effective force law but poses a serious
fine-tuning problem for LCDM.

An Infrared Divergence Problem in the cosmological measure theory and  the anthropic reasoning","
Abstract: An anthropic principle has made it possible to answer the difficult question
of why the observable value of cosmological constant ($\Lambda\sim 10^{-47}$
GeV${}^4$) is so disconcertingly tiny compared to predicted value of vacuum
energy density $\rho_{SUSY}\sim 10^{12}$ GeV${}^4$. Unfortunately, there is a
darker side to this argument, as it consequently leads to another absurd
prediction: that the probability to observe the value $\Lambda=0$ for randomly
selected observer exactly equals to 1. We'll call this controversy an infrared
divergence problem. It is shown that the IRD prediction can be avoided with the
help of a Linde-Vanchurin {\em singular runaway measure} coupled with the
calculation of relative Bayesian probabilities by the means of the {\em
doomsday argument}. Moreover, it is shown that while the IRD problem occurs for
the {\em prediction stage} of value of $\Lambda$, it disappears at the {\em
explanatory stage} when $\Lambda$ has already been measured by the observer.

Quasinormal modes of black holes: from astrophysics to string theory","
Abstract: Perturbations of black holes, initially considered in the context of possible
observations of astrophysical effects, have been studied for the past ten years
in string theory, brane-world models and quantum gravity. Through the famous
gauge/gravity duality, proper oscillations of perturbed black holes, called
quasinormal modes (QNMs), allow for the description of the hydrodynamic regime
in the dual finite temperature field theory at strong coupling, which can be
used to predict the behavior of quark-gluon plasmas in the nonperturbative
regime. On the other hand, the brane-world scenarios assume the existence of
extra dimensions in nature, so that multidimensional black holes can be formed
in a laboratory experiment. All this stimulated active research in the field of
perturbations of higher-dimensional black holes and branes during recent years.
In this review recent achievements on various aspects of black hole
perturbations are discussed such as decoupling of variables in the perturbation
equations, quasinormal modes (with special emphasis on various numerical and
analytical methods of calculations), late-time tails, gravitational stability,
AdS/CFT interpretation of quasinormal modes, and holographic superconductors.
We also touch on state-of-the-art observational possibilities for detecting
quasinormal modes of black holes.

Constraints on a Non-thermal History from Galactic Dark Matter Spikes","

non-observation of an excess of diffuse gamma-rays and from the properties of
bright gamma-ray point sources observed by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope,
but these constraints depend sensitively on the details of the formation of the

that, especially if WIMPs annihilate primarily to quarks or gauge bosons, it is
possible to extract meaningful and conservative bounds on the annihilation

an oscillation-producing hot-spot on the stellar surface. The most likely

Spectral properties of backscattered solar Ly-alpha radiation in the  heliosphere: a theoretical search of the heliospheric boundaries effects","
Abstract: We explore imprints of the solar wind interaction with the local interstellar
medium on spectral properties of the backscattered solar Ly-alpha radiation. We
employ newly developed effective model for the interstellar H atom velocity
distribution function in the heliosphere (Katushkina and Izmodenov 2010, 2011).
This model takes into account both global effects of H atom perturbations at
the heliospheric boundaries and local (i.e. within 10-20 AU from the Sun)
effects of the solar ionization, charge exchange, solar gravitation and
radiation pressure. Backscattered solar Ly-alpha profiles and their zero, first
and second moments were computed at 1 AU for the anti-solar directions of
line-of-sight. Then the moments are compared with the moments calculated by
using more simplified one-component and two-component hot models. The
comparison shows that the Ly-alpha intensities calculated in the frame of new
model are somewhat smaller than those calculated by means of the simplified
models. Small differences in the first moment (i.e. line-shift) are also
observed in the downwind direction. The largest difference between new model
and hot models is seen in the second moment of the backscattered Ly-alpha
profile. This moment is also called as line-of-sight temperature or line-width
of the backscattered spectra. The spectral width depends on the width of the H
atom velocity distribution function within few AU from the Sun. We show that
the line-widths calculated on the basis of the our model is qualitatively
different from those of simplified models.

Dark Subhaloes and Disturbances in Extended HI Discs","
Abstract: We develop a perturbative approach to study the excitation of disturbances in
the extended atomic hydrogen (HI) discs of galaxies produced by passing dark
matter subhaloes. The shallow gravitational potential of the dark matter
subhaloes (compared to the primary halo) allows us to use the epicyclic
approximation, the equations of which we solve by modal analysis, i.e.,
assuming a disc is composed of N radial rings with M modes. We show that
properties of dark matter subhaloes can be inferred from the profile and
amplitude of the modal energy of the disc. Namely, we find that the overall
amplitude of the response gives the mass of the dark sub-halo. Motivated by
this modal analysis, we then show that the density response shows similar
features. Finally, we show that our results agree with those from full
hydrodynamic simulation. We find a simple scaling relation between the
satellite mass and Fourier amplitudes of the resultant surface density of the
gas disc where the effective Fourier amplitude (essentially a sum over the low
order modes) scales as $m_{s}^{1/2}$, where $m_{s}$ is the satellite mass. The
utility of this relation is that it can be readily applied to an observed HI
map to deduce the satellite mass without recourse to full numerical simulation.
This will greatly aid us in analyzing large samples of spiral galaxies to
constrain the population of dwarf satellites in the Local Volume.

Discovery of a faint X-ray counterpart and of a parsec-long X-ray tail  for the middle-aged, gamma-ray only pulsar PSR J0357+3205","
Abstract: The Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite opened a new era
for pulsar astronomy, detecting gamma-ray pulsations from more than 60 pulsars,
~40% of which are not seen at radio wavelengths. One of the most interesting
sources discovered by LAT is PSR J0357+3205, a radio-quiet, middle-aged (tau_C
~0.5 Myr) pulsar standing out for its very low spin-down luminosity (Erot
~6x10^33 erg/s), indeed the lowest among non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars. A deep
X-ray observation with Chandra (0.5-10 keV), coupled with sensitive
optical/infrared ground-based images of the field, allowed us to identify PSR
J0357+3205 as a faint source with a soft spectrum, consistent with a purely
non-thermal emission (photon index Gamma=2.53+/-0.25). The absorbing column
(NH=8+/-4x10^20 cm^-2) is consistent with a distance of a few hundred parsecs.
Moreover, the Chandra data unveiled a huge (9 arcmin long) extended feature
apparently protruding from the pulsar. Its non-thermal X-ray spectrum points to
synchrotron emission from energetic particles from the pulsar wind, possibly
similar to other elongated X-ray tails associated with rotation-powered pulsars
and explained as bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). However, energetic
arguments, as well as the peculiar morphology of the diffuse feature associated
with PSR J0357+3205 make the bow-shock PWN interpretation rather challenging.

Dissecting the size evolution of elliptical galaxies since z~1: puffing  up vs minor merging scenarios","
Abstract: We have explored the buildup of the local mass-size relation of elliptical
galaxies using two visually classified samples. At low redshift we compiled a
subsample of 2,656 elliptical galaxies from SDSS, whereas at higher redshift
(up to z~1) we extracted a sample of 228 object from the HST/ACS images of the
GOODS. All the galaxies in our study have spectroscopic data, allowing us to
determine the age and mass of the stellar component. Using the fossil record
information contained in the stellar populations of our local sample, we do not
find any evidence for an age segregation at a given stellar mass depending on
the size of the galaxies. At a fixed dynamical mass there is only a <9% size
difference in the two extreme age quartiles of our sample. Consequently, the
local evidence does not support a scenario whereby the present-day mass-size
relation has been progressively established via a bottom-up sequence, where
older galaxies occupy the lower part this relation, remaining in place since
their formation. We find a trend in size that is insensitive to the age of the
stellar populations, at least since z~1. This result supports the idea that the
stellar mass-size relation is formed at z~1, with all galaxies populating a
region which roughly corresponds to 1/2 of the present size distribution. The
fact that the evolution in size is independent of stellar age, together with
the absence of an increase in the scatter of the relationship with redshift
does not support the puffing up mechanism. The observational evidence, however,
can not reject at this stage the minor merging hypothesis. We have made an
estimation of the number of minor merger events necessary to bring the high-z
galaxies into the local relation compatible with the observed size evolution.
Since z=0.8, if the merger mass ratio is 1:3 we estimate ~3+-1 minor mergers
and if the ratio is 1:10 we obtain ~8+-2 events.

"Title:
Eccentric binaries: Tidal flows and periastron events","
Abstract: A number of binary systems present evidence of enhanced activity around
periastron passage, suggesting a connection between tidal interactions and
these periastron effects. The aim of this investigation is to study the
time-dependent response of a star's surface as it is perturbed by a binary
companion. We derive expressions for the rate of dissipation, $\dot{E}$, of the
kinetic energy by the viscous flows driven by tidal interactions on the surface
layer. The method is tested by comparing the results from a grid of model
calculations with the analytical predictions of Hut (1981) and the
synchronization timescales of Zahn (1977, 2008). Our results for the orbital
cycle averaged energy dissipation on orbital separation are consistent with
those of Hut for model binaries with orbital separations at periastron >8
stellar radii. The model also reproduces the predicted pseudo-synchronization
angular velocity for moderate eccentricities and the same scaling of
synchronization timescales for circular orbits with separation as given by
Zahn. The computations gives the distribution of $\dot{E}$ over the stellar
surface, and show that it is generally concentrated at the equatorial latitude,
with maxima generally located around four clearly defined longitudes,
corresponding to the fastest azimuthal velocity perturbations. Maximum
amplitudes occur around periastron passage or slightly thereafter for
supersynchronously rotating stars. In very eccentric binaries, the distribution
of $\dot{E}$ over the surface changes significantly as a function of orbital
phase, with small spatial structures appearing after periastron. An exploratory
calculation for the highly eccentric binary system delta Sco suggests that the
sudden and large amplitude variations in surface properties around periastron
may contribute toward the activity observed around this orbital phase.

Instrumental oscillations in RHESSI count rates during solar flares","
Abstract: Aims: We seek to illustrate the analysis problems posed by RHESSI spacecraft
motion by studying persistent instrumental oscillations found in the
lightcurves measured by RHESSI's X-ray detectors in the 6-12 keV and 12-25 keV
energy range during the decay phase of the flares of 2004 November 4 and 6.
Methods: The various motions of the RHESSI spacecraft which may contribute to
the manifestation of oscillations are studied. The response of each detector in
turn is also investigated. Results: We find that on 2004 November 6 the
observed oscillations correspond to the nutation period of the RHESSI
instrument. These oscillations are also of greatest amplitude for detector 5,
while in the lightcurves of many other detectors the oscillations are small or
undetectable. We also find that the variation in detector pointing is much
larger during this flare than the counterexample of 2004 November 4.
Conclusions: Sufficiently large nutation motions of the RHESSI spacecraft lead
to clearly observable oscillations in count rates, posing a significant hazard
for data analysis. This issue is particularly problematic for detector 5 due to
its design characteristics. Dynamic correction of the RHESSI counts, accounting
for the livetime, data gaps, and the transmission of the bi-grid collimator of
each detector, is required to overcome this issue. These corrections should be
applied to all future oscillation studies.

Incomplete carbon-oxygen detonation in Type Ia supernovae","
Abstract: Incomplete carbon-oxygen detonation with reactions terminating after burning
of 12C in the leading 12C + 12C reaction (C-detonation) may occur in the low
density outer layers of white dwarfs exploding as Type Ia supernovae (SNIa).
Previous studies of carbon-oxygen detonation structure and stability at low
densities were performed under the assumption that the ""velocity"" of a
detonation wave derives from complete burning of carbon and oxygen to iron. In
fact, at densities <10^6 g/cm3 the detonation in SNIa may release less than a
half of the available nuclear energy. In this paper we study basic properties
of such detonations. We find that the length of an unsupported steady-state
C-detonation is 30-100 times greater than previously estimated, and that the
decreased energy has a drastic effect on the detonation stability. In contrast
to complete detonations which are one-dimensionally stable, C-detonations may
be one-dimensionally unstable and propagate by periodically re-igniting
themselves via spontaneous burning. The re-ignition period at rho < 10^6 g/cm3
is estimated to be greater than the time-scale of a SNIa explosion. This
suggests that propagation and quenching of C-detonations at these densities
could be affected by the instability. Potential observational implications of
this effect are discussed.

"Title:
A model independent measure of the large scale curvature of the Universe","
Abstract: Cosmological distances as a function of redshift depend on the effective
curvature density via the effect on the geometrical path of photons from large
scale spatial curvature and its effect on the expansion history, H(z).
Cosmological time, however, depends on the expansion history only. Therefore,
by combining distance and lookback time observations (or other estimates of the
expansion history), it is possible to isolate the geometrical curvature
contribution and measure the curvature in a model independent way, i.e., free
from assumptions about the energy content of the universe.
We investigate two different approaches to accomplish this task; the
differential and the integral approach. The differential approach requires, in
addition to distances, derivatives of distance with respect to redshift as well
as knowledge of the expansion history. The integral approach is based on
measuring the integral of the inverse of the expansion history via measurements
of cosmic time as derived, e.g., from galaxy ages.
In this paper, we attempt to constrain the large scale curvature of the
Universe using distances obtained from observations of Type Ia supernovae
together with inferred ages of passively evolving galaxies and Hubble parameter
estimates from the large scale clustering of galaxies. Current data are
consistent with zero spatial curvature, although the uncertainty on the
curvature density is of order unity. Future data sets with on the order of
thousands of Type Ia supernovae distances and galaxy ages will allow us to
constrain the curvature density with an uncertainty of less than 0.1 at the 95%
confidence level.

Excitation of Slow-Modes in Network Magnetic Elements Through Magnetic  Pumping","
Abstract: From radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar atmosphere we
find a new mechanism for the excitation of longitudinal slow modes within
magnetic flux concentrations. We find that the convective downdrafts in the
immediate surroundings of magnetic elements are responsible for the excitation
of slow modes. The coupling between the external downdraft and the plasma
motion internal to the flux concentration is mediated by the inertial forces of
the downdraft that act on the magnetic flux concentration. These forces, in
conjunction with the downward movement, pump the internal atmosphere in the
downward direction, which entails a fast downdraft in the photospheric and
chromospheric layers of the magnetic element. Subsequent to the transient
pumping phase, the atmosphere rebounds, causing a slow mode traveling along the
magnetic flux concentration in the upward direction. It develops into a shock
wave in chromospheric heights, possibly capable of producing some kind of
dynamic fibril. We propose an observational detection of this process.

photometric data has brought new possibilities for asteroseismology across the
H-R diagram. Solar-like oscillations are now observed in many stars, including
red giants and main- sequence stars. Aims. Based on several hundred identified
pulsating red giants, we aim to characterize their oscillation amplitudes and
widths. These observables are compared with those of main-sequence stars in
order to test trends and scaling laws for these parameters for both
main-sequence stars and red giants. Methods. An automated fitting procedure is
used to analyze several hundred Fourier spectra. For each star, a modeled
spectrum is fitted to the observed oscillation spectrum, and mode parameters
are derived. Results. Amplitudes and widths of red-giant solar-like
oscillations are estimated for several hundred modes of oscillation. Amplitudes
are relatively high (several hundred ppm) and widths relatively small (very few
tenths of a {\mu}Hz). Conclusions. Widths measured in main-sequence stars show
a different variation with the effective temperature than red giants. A single
scaling law is derived for mode amplitudes of both red giants and main-sequence
stars versus their luminosity to mass ratio. However, our results suggest that
two regimes may also be compatible with the observations.

Monitoring Variable X-ray Sources in Nearby Galaxies","
Abstract: In the last decade, it has been possible to monitor variable X-ray sources in
nearby galaxies. In particular, since the launch of Chandra, M31 has been
regularly observed. It is perhaps the only nearby galaxy which is observed by
an X-ray telescope regularly throughout operation. With 10 years of
observations, the center of M31 has been observed with Chandra for over 1 Msec
and the X-ray skies of M31 consist of many transients and variables.
Furthermore, the X-ray Telescope of Swift has been monitoring several
ultraluminous X-ray sources in nearby galaxies regularly. Not only can we
detect long-term X-ray variability, we can also find spectral variation as well
as possible orbital period. I will review some of the important Chandra and
Swift monitoring observations of nearby galaxies in the last decade. I will
also discuss the possibility to use MAXI for X-ray monitoring observations of
nearby galaxies.

"Title:
Investigating the merger origin of Early-Type Galaxies using ultra-deep  optical images","
Abstract: The mass assembly of galaxies leaves various imprints on their surroundings,
such as shells, streams and tidal tails. The frequency and properties of these
fine structures depend on the mechanism driving the mass assembly: e.g. a
monolithic collapse, rapid cold-gas accretion followed by violent disk
instabilities, minor mergers or major dry / wet mergers. Therefore, by studying
the outskirts of galaxies, one can learn about their main formation mechanism.
I present here our on-going work to characterize the outskirts of Early-Type
Galaxies (ETGs), which are powerful probes at low redshift of the hierarchical
mass assembly of galaxies. This work relies on ultra-deep optical images
obtained at CFHT with the wide-field of view MegaCam camera of field and
cluster ETGs obtained as part of the Atlas-3D and NGVS projects. State of the
art numerical simulations are used to interpret the data. The images reveal a
wealth of unknown faint structures at levels as faint as 29 mag arcsec-2 in the
g-band. Initial results for two galaxies are presented here.

"Title:
Simple Models of Metal-Line Absorption and Emission from Cool Gas  Outflows","
Abstract: We analyze the absorption and emission-line profiles produced by a set of
simple, cool gas wind models motivated by galactic-scale outflow observations.
We implement monte carlo radiative transfer techniques that track the
propagation of scattered and fluorescent photons to generate 1D spectra and 2D
spectral images. We focus on the MgII 2796,28303 doublet and FeII UV1 multiplet
at ~2600A, but the results are applicable to other transitions that trace
outflows (e.g. NaI, Lya, SiII). By design, the resonance transitions show
blue-shifted absorption but one also predicts strong resonance and
fine-structure line-emission at roughly the systemic velocity. This
line-emission `fills-in' the absorption reducing the equivalent width by up to
50%, shift the absorption-lin centroid by tens of km/s, and reduce the
effective opacity near systemic. Analysis of cool gas outflows that ignores
this line-emission may incorrectly infer that the gas is partially covered,
measure asignificantly lower peak optical depth, and/or conclude that gas at
systemic velocity is absent. Because the FeII lines are connected by
optically-thin transitions to fine-structure levels, their profiles more
closely reproduce the intrinsic opacity of the wind. Together these results
naturally explain the absorption and emission-line characteristics observed for
star-forming galaxies at z<1. We also study a scenario promoted to describe the
outflows of z~3 Lyman break galaxies and find prfiles inconsistent with the
observations due to scattered photon emission. Although line-emission
complicates the analysis of absorption-line profiles, the surface brightness
profiles offer a unique means of assessing the morphology and size of
galactic-scale winds. Furthermore, the kinematics and line-ratios offer
powerful diagnostics of outflows, motivating deep, spatially-extended
spectroscopic observations.

A large scale coherent magnetic field: interactions with free streaming  particles and limits from the CMB","
Abstract: We study a homogeneous and nearly-isotropic Universe permeated by a
homogeneous magnetic field. Together with an isotropic fluid, the homogeneous
magnetic field, which is the primary source of anisotropy, leads to a
plane-symmetric Bianchi I model of the Universe. However, when free-streaming
relativistic particles are present, they generate an anisotropic pressure which
counteracts the one from the magnetic field such that the Universe becomes
isotropized. We show that due to this effect, the CMB temperature anisotropy
from a homogeneous magnetic field is significantly suppressed if the the
neutrino masses are smaller than 0.3 eV.

Chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks - the effects of viscous  accretion, turbulent mixing and disk winds","
Abstract: We calculate the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks considering
radial viscous accretion, vertical turbulent mixing and vertical disk winds. We
study the effects on the disk chemical structure when different models for the
formation of molecular hydrogen on dust grains are adopted. Our gas-phase
chemistry is extracted from the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry (Rate06) to
which we have added detailed gas-grain interactions. We use our chemical model
results to generate synthetic near- and mid-infrared LTE line emission spectra
and compare these with recent Spitzer observations. Our results show that if H2
formation on warm grains is taken into consideration, the H2O and OH abundances
in the disk surface increase significantly. We find the radial accretion flow
strongly influences the molecular abundances, with those in the cold midplane
layers particularly affected. On the other hand, we show that diffusive
turbulent mixing affects the disk chemistry in the warm molecular layers,
influencing the line emission from the disk and subsequently improving
agreement with observations. We find that NH3, CH3OH, C2H2 and
sulphur-containing species are greatly enhanced by the inclusion of turbulent
mixing. We demonstrate that disk winds potentially affect the disk chemistry
and the resulting molecular line emission in a similar manner to that found
when mixing is included.

Solar-like oscillations and activity in Procyon: A comparison of the  2007 MOST and ground-based radial velocity campaigns","
Abstract: We compare the simultaneous 2007 space-based MOST photometry and ground-based
radial velocity observations of the F5 star Procyon. We identify slow
variations in the MOST data that are similar to those reported in the radial
velocity (RV) time series, and confirm by comparison with the Sun that these
variations are likely the signature of stellar activity. The MOST power
spectrum yields clear evidence for individual oscillation frequencies that
match those found in the radial velocity data by Bedding et al. (2010). We
identify the same ridges due to modes of different spherical degree in both
datasets, but are not able to confirm a definite ridge identification using the
MOST data. We measure the luminosity amplitude per radial mode A_{l=0, phot} =
9.1 +/- 0.5 ppm. Combined with the estimate for the RV data by Arentoft et al.
(2008) this gives a mean amplitude ratio of A_{l=0, phot}/A_{l=0, RV} = 0.24
+/- 0.02 ppm cm^{-1} s, considerably higher than expected from scaling
relations but in reasonable agreement with theoretical models by Houdek (2010).
We also compare the amplitude ratio as a function of frequency, and find that
the maximum of the oscillation envelope is shifted to higher frequencies in
photometry than in velocity.

"Title:
Enhanced neutrino signals from dark matter annihilation in the Sun via  metastable mediators","
Abstract: We calculate the neutrino signal resulting from annihilation of secluded dark
matter in the Sun. In this class of models, dark matter annihilates first into
metastable mediators, which subsequently decay into Standard Model particles.
If the mediators are long lived, they will propagate out from the dense solar
core before decaying. High energy neutrinos undergo absorption in the Sun. In
the standard scenario in which neutrinos are produced directly in the centre of
the Sun, absorption is relevant for E > 100 GeV, resulting in a significant
suppression of the neutrino spectrum beyond E ~ 1 TeV. In the secluded dark
matter scenario, the neutrino signal is greatly enhanced because neutrinos are
injected away from the core, at lower density. Since the solar density falls
exponentially with radius, metastable mediators have a significant effect on
the neutrino flux, even for decay lengths which are small compared to the solar
radius. Moreover, since neutrino detection cross sections grow with energy,
this enhancement of the high energy region of the neutrino spectrum would have
a large effect on overall event rates.

Detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the vicinity of  PSR B1706-44 and G343.1-2.3 with H.E.S.S","
Abstract: The gamma-ray pulsar PSR B1706-44 and the adjacent supernova remnant (SNR)
candidate G343.1-2.3 were observed by H.E.S.S. during a dedicated observation
campaign in 2007. As a result of this observation campaign, a new source of
very-high-energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission, HESS J1708-443, was
detected with a statistical significance of 7 sigma, although no significant
point-like emission was detected at the position of the energetic pulsar
itself. In this paper, the morphological and spectral analyses of the
newly-discovered TeV source are presented. The centroid of HESS J1708-443 is
considerably offset from the pulsar and located near the apparent center of the
SNR, at RA(J2000) = 17h08m11s +/- 17s and Dec(J2000) = -44d20' +/- 4'. The
source is found to be significantly more extended than the H.E.S.S. point

0.04 deg. Its integral flux between 1 and 10 TeV is ~ 3.8 x 10^-12 ph cm^-2

Abstract: COrE (Cosmic Origins Explorer) is a fourth-generation full-sky,
microwave-band satellite recently proposed to ESA within Cosmic Vision
2015-2025. COrE will provide maps of the microwave sky in polarization and
temperature in 15 frequency bands, ranging from 45 GHz to 795 GHz, with an
angular resolution ranging from 23 arcmin (45 GHz) and 1.3 arcmin (795 GHz) and
sensitivities roughly 10 to 30 times better than PLANCK (depending on the
frequency channel). The COrE mission will lead to breakthrough science in a
wide range of areas, ranging from primordial cosmology to galactic and
extragalactic science. COrE is designed to detect the primordial gravitational
waves generated during the epoch of cosmic inflation at more than $3\sigma $
for $r=(T/S)>=10^{-3}$. It will also measure the CMB gravitational lensing
deflection power spectrum to the cosmic variance limit on all linear scales,
allowing us to probe absolute neutrino masses better than laboratory
experiments and down to plausible values suggested by the neutrino oscillation
data. COrE will also search for primordial non-Gaussianity with significant
improvements over Planck in its ability to constrain the shape (and amplitude)
of non-Gaussianity. In the areas of galactic and extragalactic science, in its
highest frequency channels COrE will provide maps of the galactic polarized
dust emission allowing us to map the galactic magnetic field in areas of
diffuse emission not otherwise accessible to probe the initial conditions for
star formation. COrE will also map the galactic synchrotron emission thirty
times better than PLANCK. This White Paper reviews the COrE science program,

N-body simulations with generic non-Gaussian initial conditions II: Halo  bias","
Abstract: We present N-body simulations for generic non-Gaussian initial conditions
with the aim of exploring and modelling the scale-dependent halo bias. This
effect is evident at very large scales requiring large simulation boxes. In
addition, the previously available prescription to implement generic
non-Gaussian initial conditions has been improved to keep under control
higher-order terms which were spoiling the power spectrum on large scales. We
pay particular attention to the differences between physical,
inflation-motivated primordial bispectra and their factorizable templates, and
to the operational definition of the non-Gaussian halo bias (which has both a
scale-dependent and an approximately scale-independent contributions). We find
that analytic predictions for both the non-Gaussian halo mass function and halo
bias work well once a calibration factor (which was introduced before) is
calibrated on simulations. The halo bias remains therefore an extremely
promising tool to probe primordial non-Gaussianity and thus to give insights
into the physical mechanism that generated the primordial perturbations. The
simulation outputs and tables of the analytic predictions will be made publicly
available via the non-Gaussian comparison project web site

A Mid-Infrared Census of Star Formation Activity in Bolocam Galactic  Plane Survey Sources","
Abstract: We present the results of a search for mid-infrared signs of star formation
activity in the 1.1 mm sources in the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS). We
have correlated the BGPS catalog with available mid-IR Galactic plane catalogs
based on the Spitzer Space Telescope GLIMPSE legacy survey and the Midcourse
Space Experiment (MSX) Galactic plane survey. We find that 44% (3,712 of 8,358)
of the BGPS sources contain at least one mid-IR source, including 2,457 of
5,067 (49%) within the area where all surveys overlap (10 deg < l < 65 deg).
Accounting for chance alignments between the BGPS and mid-IR sources, we
conservatively estimate that 20% of the BPGS sources within the area where all
surveys overlap show signs of active star formation. We separate the BGPS
sources into four groups based on their probability of star formation activity.
Extended Green Objects (EGOs) and Red MSX Sources (RMS) make up the highest
probability group, while the lowest probability group is comprised of
""starless"" BGPS sources which were not matched to any mid-IR sources. The mean
1.1 mm flux of each group increases with increasing probability of active star
formation. We also find that the ""starless"" BGPS sources are the most compact,
while the sources with the highest probability of star formation activity are
on average more extended with large skirts of emission. A subsample of 280 BGPS
sources with known distances demonstrates that mass and mean H_2 column density
also increase with probability of star formation activity.

The role of binding energies of neutron stars on the accretion driven  evolution","
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are believed to descend from low mass x-ray binaries.
Observable parameters of binary millisecond pulsars e.g. mass of the pulsar,
mass of the companion, spin period of the pulsar, orbital period, orbital
eccentricity etc are used to probe the past accretion history of the
millisecond pulsars. But unfortunately in these studies, binding energy of the
neutron star is not considered commonly. We show that the effect of the binding
energy is significant in the estimation of the amount of mass accretion and
thus should be incorporated in models for binary evolutions. Moreover,
different Equations of State for dense matter give different values for the
accreted mass for the same amount of increase in the gravitational mass of the
neutron star implying the need of constraining dense matter Equations of State
even to understand the spin-up procedure properly.

Self-interacting Dark Matter Energy Density","
Abstract: We investigate cosmological implications of an energy density contribution
arising by elastic dark matter self-interactions. Its scaling behaviour shows
that it can be the dominant energy contribution in the early universe.
Constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis give an upper limit on the
self-interaction strength which allows for the same strength as standard model
strong interactions. Furthermore we explore the cosmological consequences of an
early self-interaction dominated universe. Chemical dark matter decoupling
requires that self-interacting dark matter particles are rather light (keV
range) but we find that super-weak inelastic interactions are predicted by
strong elastic dark matter self-interactions. Assuming a second, collisionless
cold dark matter component, its natural decoupling scale exceeds the weak scale
and is in accord with the electron and positron excess observed by PAMELA and
Fermi-LAT. Structure formation analysis reveals a linear growing solution
during self-interaction domination, enhancing structures up to ~ 10^(-3) solar
masses long before the formation of the first stars.

Abstract: We present a sequence of five deep observations of SS433 made over the summer
of 2007 using the VLA in the A configuration at 5 and 8 GHz. In this paper we
study the brightness profiles of the jets and their time evolution. We also
examine the spectral index distribution in the source. We find (as previously
reported from the analysis of a single earlier image) that the profiles of the
east and west jets are remarkably similar if projection and Doppler beaming are
taken into account. The sequence of five images allows us to disentangle the
evolution of brightness of individual pieces of jet from the variations of jet
power originating at the core. We find that the brightness of each piece of the
jet fades as an exponential function of age (or distance from the core),
exp(-tau/tau'), where tau is the age at emission and tau' = 55.9 +- 1.7 days.
This evolutionary model describes both the east and west jets equally well.
There is also significant variation (by a factor of at least five) in jet power
with birth epoch, with the east and west jets varying in synchrony. The lack of
deceleration between the scale of the optical Balmer line emission (10^15 cm)
and that of the radio emission (10^17 cm) requires that the jet material is
much denser than its surroundings. We find that the density ratio must exceed
300:1.

Spectral evolution of long Gamma Ray Burst prompt emission:  electrostatic acceleration and adiabatic expansion","
Abstract: Despite the great variation in the light curves of Gamma Ray Burst (GRB)

broadly peaked. In particular, their spectral evolution is well described by
the hardness-intensity correlation during a single pulse decay phase, when the
SED peak height S_p decreases as its peak energy E_p decreases. We propose an
acceleration scenario, based on electrostatic acceleration, to interpret the
E_p distribution peak at ~ 0.25 MeV. We show that during the decay phase of
individual pulses in the long GRB light curve, the adiabatic expansion losses
likely dominate the synchrotron cooling effects. The energy loss as due to
adiabatic expansion can also be used to describe the spectral evolution
observed during their decay phase. The spectral evolution predicted by our
scenario is consistent with that observed in single pulses of long BATSE GRBs.

each wavelength with mid-occultation times consistent with circular orbits. The
brightness temperatures of these planets are deduced from the infrared

The structure and evolution of quasi-stars","
Abstract: The existence of bright quasars at high redshifts implies that supermassive
black holes were able to form in the early Universe. Though a number of
mechanisms to achieve this have been proposed, none yet stands out. A recent
suggestion is the formation of quasi-stars, initially stellar-mass black holes
accreting from hydrostatic giant-like envelopes of gas, formed from the
monolithic collapse of pre-galactic gas clouds. In this work, we modify the
Cambridge STARS stellar evolution package to construct detailed models of the
evolution of these objects. We find that, in all of our models, the black hole
inside the envelope is able to reach slightly more than one-tenth of the total
mass of the system before hydrostatic equilibrium breaks down. This breakdown
occurs after a few million years of evolution. We show that the mechanism which
causes the hydrostatic evolution to end is present in polytropic models. We
also show that the solutions are highly sensitive to the size of the inner
boundary radius and that no physical solutions exist if the inner boundary is
chosen to be less than about 0.3 of the Bondi radius.

"Title:
Investigation of a Sunspot Complex by Helioseismology","
Abstract: Sunspot regions often form complexes of activity that may live for several
solar rotations, and represent a major component of the Sun's magnetic
activity. It had been suggested that the close appearance of active regions in
space and time might be related to common subsurface roots, or ""nests"" of
activity. EUV images show that the active regions are magnetically connected in
the corona, but subsurface connections have not been established. We
investigate the subsurface structure and dynamics of a large complex of
activity, NOAA 10987-10989, observed during the SOHO/MDI Dynamics run in
March-April 2008, which was a part of the Whole Heliospheric Interval (WHI)
campaign. The active regions in this complex appeared in a narrow latitudinal
range, probably representing a subsurface toroidal flux tube. We use the MDI
full-disk Dopplergrams to measure perturbations of travel times of acoustic
waves traveling to various depths by using time-distance helioseismology, and
obtain sound-speed and flow maps by inversion of the travel times. The
subsurface flow maps show an interesting dynamics of decaying active regions
with persistent shearing flows, which may be important for driving the flaring
and CME activity, observed during the WHI campaign. Our analysis, including the
seismic sound-speed inversion results and the distribution of deep-focus
travel-time anomalies, gave indications of diverging roots of the magnetic
structures, as could be expected from $\Omega$-loop structures. However, no
clear connection in the depth range of 0-48 Mm among the three active regions
in this complex of activity was detected.

The ATLAS3D project - III. A census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of Fast and Slow Rotators","
Abstract: We provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 Re of a
volume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the nearby Universe,
using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the ATLAS3D
project. We exploit the LambdaR parameter to characterise the existence of two
families of ETGs: Slow Rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fields
and often include stellar kinematically Distinct Cores (KDCs), and Fast
Rotators which have regular velocity fields. Our complete sample of 260 ETGs
leads to a new criterion to disentangle Fast and Slow Rotators which now
includes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (Epsilon). It separates the
two classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than a
criterion based on V/Sigma: Slow Rotators and Fast Rotators have LambdaR lower
and larger than kFSxSQRT(Epsilon), respectively, where kFS=0.31 for
measurements made within 1 Re. We show that the vast majority of early-type
galaxies are Fast Rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with aligned
photometric and kinematic axes (Paper II, Krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discs
and often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in the
volume-limited ATLAS3D sample. Fast Rotators span the full range of apparent
ellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsic
ellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologies
consistent with spiral galaxies. Only a small fraction of ETGs are Slow
Rotators representing 14% (36/260) of the ATLAS3D sample of ETGs. Of all Slow
Rotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like components
and are rather low mass objects (Mdyn<10^10.5 M_Sun). All other Slow Rotators
(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (Epsilon_e<0.4), tend to be massive
(Mdyn>10^10.5 M_Sun), and often (17/32) exhibit KDCs.

"Title:
Is the 2MASS clustering dipole convergent?","
Abstract: There is a long-standing controversy about the convergence of the dipole
moment of the galaxy angular distribution (the so-called clustering dipole). We
study the growth of the clustering dipole of galaxies as a function of the
limiting flux of the sample from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS).
Contrary to some earlier claims, we find that the dipole does not converge
before the completeness limit of the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog, i.e. up to
13.5 mag in the near-infrared K_s band (equivalent to an effective distance of
300 Mpc/h). We compare the observed growth of the dipole with the theoretically
expected, conditional one (i.e., given the velocity of the Local Group relative
to the CMB), for the LambdaCDM power spectrum and cosmological parameters
constrained by WMAP. The observed growth turns out to be within 1-sigma
confidence level of its theoretical counterpart once the proper observational
window of the 2MASS flux-limited catalog is included. For a contrast, if the
adopted window is a top-hat, then the predicted dipole grows significantly
faster and converges to its final value for a distance of about 300 Mpc/h. By
comparing the observational windows, we show that for a given flux limit and a
corresponding distance limit, the 2MASS flux-weighted window passes less
large-scale signal than the top-hat one. We conclude that the growth of the
2MASS dipole for effective distances greater than 200 Mpc/h is only apparent.
On the other hand, for a distance of 80 Mpc/h (mean depth of the 2MASS Redshift
Survey) and the LambdaCDM power spectrum, the true dipole is expected to reach
only ~80% of its final value. Eventually, since for the window function of
2MASS the predicted growth is consistent with the observed one, we can compare
the two to evaluate beta = (Omega_m)^0.55 / b. The result is beta = 0.38+-0.04,
which leads to an estimate of the density parameter Omega_m = 0.20+-0.08.

Radial Stellar Pulsation and 3D Convection. I. Numerical Methods and  Adiabatic Test Cases","
Abstract: We are developing a 3D radiation hydrodynamics code to simulate the
interaction of convection and pulsation in classical variable stars. One key
goal is the ability to carry these simulations to full amplitude in order to
compare them with observed light and velocity curves. Previous 2D calculations
were prevented from doing this because of drift in the radial coordinate
system, due to the algorithm defining radial movement of the coordinate system

coordinate system flow algorithm to require that the mass in a spherical shell
remain constant throughout the pulsation cycle. We perform adiabatic test
calculations to show that large amplitude solutions repeat over more than 150
pulsation periods. We also verify that the computational method conserves the
peak kinetic energy per period, as must be true for adiabatic pulsation models.

"Title:
Three-dimensional simulation of massive star formation in the disk  accretion scenario","
Abstract: The most massive stars can form via standard disk accretion - despite of the
radiation pressure generated - due to the fact that the massive accretion disk
yields a strong anisotropy in the radiation field, releasing most of the
radiation pressure perpendicular to the disk accretion flow. Here, we analyze
the self-gravity of the forming circumstellar disk as the potential major
driver of the angular momentum transport in such massive disks responsible for
the high accretion rates needed for the formation of massive stars. For this
purpose, we perform self-gravity radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the
collapse of massive pre-stellar cores. The formation and evolution of the
resulting circumstellar disk is investigated in 1.) axially symmetric
simulations using an alpha-shear-viscosity prescription and 2.) a
three-dimensional simulation, in which the angular momentum transport is
provided self-consistently by developing gravitational torques in the
self-gravitating accretion disk. The simulation series of different strength of
the alpha-viscosity shows that the accretion history of the forming star is
mostly independent of the alpha-viscosity-parameter. The accretion history of
the three-dimensional run driven by self-gravity is more time-dependent than
the viscous disk evolution in axial symmetry. The mean accretion rate, i.e. the
stellar mass growth, is nearly identical to the alpha-viscosity models. We
conclude that the development of gravitational torques in self-gravitating
disks around forming massive stars provides a self-consistent mechanism to
efficiently transport the angular momentum to outer disk radii. Also the
formation of the most massive stars can therefore be understood in the standard
accretion disk scenario.

The connection between gamma-ray emission and millimeter flares in  Fermi/LAT blazars","
Abstract: We compare the gamma-ray photon flux variability of northern blazars in the
Fermi/LAT First Source Catalog with 37 GHz radio flux density curves from the
Metsahovi quasar monitoring program. We find that the relationship between
simultaneous millimeter (mm) flux density and gamma-ray photon flux is
different for different types of blazars. The flux relation between the two
bands is positively correlated for quasars and does not exist for BLLacs.
Furthermore, we find that the levels of gamma-ray emission in high states
depend on the phase of the high frequency radio flare, with the brightest
gamma-ray events coinciding with the initial stages of a mm flare. The mean
observed delay from the beginning of a mm flare to the peak of the gamma-ray
emission is about 70 days, which places the average location of the gamma-ray
production at or downstream of the radio core. We discuss alternative scenarios

Abstract: We present our second paper on the Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeter

commission the ATA's wide-field survey capabilities. ATATS explores the
challenges of multi-epoch transient and variable source surveys in the domain
of dynamic range limits and changing (u,v) coverage.
Here we present images made using data from the individual epochs, as well as
a revised image combining data from all ATATS epochs. The combined image has
RMS noise 3.96 mJy / beam, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec FWHM. The
catalog, generated using a false detection rate algorithm, contains 4984
sources, and is >90% complete to 37.9 mJy. The catalogs generated from snapshot
images of the individual epochs contain between 1170 and 2019 sources over the
564 sq. deg. area in common to all epochs. The 90% completeness limits of the
single epoch catalogs range from 98.6 to 232 mJy.
We compare the catalog generated from the combined image to those from
individual epochs, and from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), a legacy survey at
the same frequency. We are able to place new constraints on the transient
population: fewer than 6e-4 transients / sq. deg., for transients brighter than
350 mJy with characteristic timescales of minutes to days. This strongly rules
out an astronomical origin for the ~1 Jy sources reported by Matsumura et al.

"Title:
Precessing AGN Jets, Bubbles and Cooling Flows","
Abstract: Several galaxy clusters are known to present multiple and misaligned pairs of
cavities seen in X-rays, as well as twisted kiloparsec-scale jets at radio
wavelengths. It suggests that the AGN precessing jets play a role in the
formation of the misaligned bubbles. Also, X-ray spectra reveal that typically
these systems are also able to supress cooling flows, predicted theoretically.
The absence of cooling flows in galaxy clusters has been a mistery for many
years since numerical simulations and analytical studies suggest that AGN jets
are highly energetic, but are unable to redistribute it at all directions. We
performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a precessing
AGN jet and the warm intracluster medium plasma, which dynamics is coupled to a
NFW dark matter gravitational potential. Radiative cooling has been taken into
account and the cooling flow problem was studied. We found that precession is
responsible for multiple pairs of bubbles, as observed. The misaligned bubbles
rise up to scales of tens of kiloparsecs, where the thermal energy released by
the jets are redistributed. After $\sim 150$ Myrs, the temperature of the gas
within the cavities is kept of order of $\sim 10^7$ K, while the denser plasma
of the intracluster medium at the central regions reaches $T \sim 10^5$ K. The
existence of multiple bubbles, at diferent directions, result in an integrated
temperature along the line of sight much larger than the simulations of
non-precessing jets. This result is in agreement with the observations. The
simulations reveal that the cooling flows cessed $\sim 50 - 70$ Myr after the
AGN jets are started.

signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum. Accordingly, the accumulated spectra
obtained by the XIS and the EPIC show some line features around 3 keV that are
attributed to the S He$\beta$ and Ar He$\alpha$ lines, respectively. Since the
Cygnus Loop is an evolved ($\sim$10,000 yr) supernova remnant whose temperature
is relatively low ($<$1 keV) compared with other young remnants, its spectrum
is generally faint above 3.0 keV, no emission lines, such as the Ar-K line have
ever been detected. The detection of the Ar-K line is the first time and we
found that its abundance is significantly higher than that of the solar value;
9.0$^{+4.0}_{-3.8}$ and 8.4$^{+2.5}_{-2.7}$ (in units of solar), estimated from
the XIS and the EPIC spectra, respectively. We conclude that the Ar-K line

Nonlinear Dependence of the Phase Screen Structure Function on the  Atmospheric Layer Thickness","
Abstract: The phase structure function accumulated by two parallel rays after

The correction establishes a sub-linearity as the lateral distance grows in
proportion to the layer thickness; it is more important for large than for

Gas depletion in Local Group dwarfs on ~250 kpc scales: Ram pressure  stripping assisted by internal heating at early times","
Abstract: A recent survey of the Galaxy and M31 reveals that more than 90% of dwarf
galaxies within 270 kpc of their host galaxy are deficient in HI gas. At such
an extreme radius, the coronal halo gas is an order of magnitude too low to
remove HI gas through ram-pressure stripping for any reasonable orbit
distribution. However, all dwarfs are known to have an ancient stellar
population (\geq 10 Gyr) from early epochs of vigorous star formation which,
through heating of HI, could allow the hot halo to remove this gas. Our model
looks at the evolution of these dwarf galaxies analytically as the host-galaxy
dark matter halo and coronal halo gas builds up over cosmic time. The dwarf
galaxies - treated as spherically symmetric, smooth distributions of dark
matter and gas - experience early star formation, which sufficiently heats the
gas allowing it to be removed easily through tidal stripping by the host
galaxy, or ram-pressure stripping by a tenuous hot halo (n_H = 3x10^{-4}
cm^{-3} at 50 kpc). This model of evolution is able to explain the observed
radial distribution of gas-deficient and gas-rich dwarfs around the Galaxy and

The Line Polarization Within a Giant Lyman-alpha Nebula","
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has suggested that Lyman-alpha nebulae could be
substantially polarized in the Lyman-alpha emission line, depending on the
geometry, kinematics, and powering mechanism at work. Polarization observations
can therefore provide a useful constraint on the source of ionization in these
systems. In this Letter, we present the first Lyman-alpha polarization
measurements for a giant Lyman-alpha nebula at z~2.656. We do not detect any
significant linear polarization of the Lyman-alpha emission:
P_{Lyman-alpha}=2.6+/-2.8% (corrected for statistical bias) within a single
large aperture. The current data also do not show evidence for the radial
polarization gradient predicted by some theoretical models. These results rule
out singly scattered Lyman-alpha (e.g., from the nearby AGN) and may be
inconsistent with some models of backscattering in a spherical outflow.
However, the effects of seeing, diminished signal-to-noise ratio, and angle
averaging within radial bins make it difficult to put strong constraints on the
radial polarization profile. The current constraints may be consistent with
higher density outflow models, spherically symmetric infall models,
photoionization by star formation within the nebula or the nearby AGN, resonant
scattering, or non-spherically symmetric cold accretion (i.e., along
filaments). Higher signal-to-noise ratio data probing to higher spatial
resolution will allow us to harness the full diagnostic power of polarization
observations in distinguishing between theoretical models of giant Lyman-alpha
nebulae.

Orbital Migration Models under Test","
Abstract: Planet-disk interaction predicts a change in the orbital elements of an
embedded planet. Through linear and fully hydrodynamical studies it has been
found that migration is typically directed inwards. Hence, this migration
process gives natural explanation for the presence of the 'hot' planets
orbiting close to the parent star, and it plays a mayor role in explaining the
formation of resonant planetary systems.
However, standard migration models for locally isothermal disks indicate a
too rapid inward migration for small mass planets, and a large number of
massive planets are found very far away from the star. Recent studies,
including more complete disk physics, have opened up new paths to slow down or
even reverse migration. The new findings on migration are discussed and

Comparing the observed Sigma distribution to previous Sigma threshold

We will discuss some of the intriguing puzzles that surround these relics. The
polarisation of the radio emission yields information about the topology of
magnetic fields in these shock waves. Here we report on MHD simulations that
highlight some problems about the origin of these magnetic fields.

The Halo Occupation Distribution of Black Holes: Dependence on Mass","
Abstract: We investigate the halo occupation distribution (HOD) of black holes within a
hydrodynamic cosmological simulation that directly follows black hole growth.
Similar to the HOD of galaxies/subhalos, we find that the black hole occupation
number can be described by the form N_BH proportional to 1+ (M_Host)^alpha
where alpha evolves mildly with redshift indicating that a given mass halo
(M_Host) at low redshift tends to host fewer BHs than at high redshift (as
expected as a result of galaxy and BH mergers). We further divide the
occupation number into contributions from black holes residing in central and
satellite galaxies within a halo. The distribution of M_BH within halos tends
to consist of a single massive BH (distributed about a peak mass strongly
correlated with M_Host), and a collection of relatively low-mass secondary BHs,
with weaker correlation with M_Host. We also examine the spatial distribution
of BHs within their host halos, and find they typically follow a power-law
radial distribution (i.e. much more centrally concentrated than the subhalo
distribution). Finally, we characterize the host mass for which BH growth is
feedback dominated (e.g. star formation quenched). We show that halos with
M_Host > 3 * 10^12 M_sun have primary BHs that are feedback dominated by z~3
with lower mass halos becoming increasingly more affected at lower redshift.

"Title:
Measuring Black Hole Spin by the Continuum-Fitting Method: Effect of  Deviations from the Novikov-Thorne Disc Model","
Abstract: The X-ray spectra of accretion discs of eight stellar-mass black holes have
been analyzed to date using the thermal continuum fitting method, and the
spectral fits have been used to estimate the spin parameters of the black
holes. However, the underlying model used in this method of estimating spin is
the general relativistic thin-disc model of Novikov & Thorne, which is only
valid for razor-thin discs. We therefore expect errors in the measured values
of spin due to inadequacies in the theoretical model. We investigate this issue
by computing spectra of numerically calculated models of thin accretion discs
around black holes, obtained via three-dimensional general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. We apply the continuum fitting method
to these computed spectra to estimate the black hole spins and check how
closely the values match the actual spin used in the GRMHD simulations. We find
that the error in the dimensionless spin parameter is up to about 0.2 for a
non-spinning black hole, depending on the inclination. For black holes with
spins of 0.7, 0.9 and 0.98, the errors are up to about 0.1, 0.03 and 0.01
respectively. These errors are comparable to or smaller than those arising from
current levels of observational uncertainty. Furthermore, we estimate that the
GRMHD simulated discs from which these error estimates are obtained correspond
to effective disc luminosities of about 0.4-0.7 Eddington, and that the errors
will be smaller for discs with luminosities of 0.3 Eddington or less, which are
used in the continuum-fitting method. We thus conclude that use of the
Novikov-Thorne thin-disc model does not presently limit the accuracy of the
continuum-fitting method of measuring black hole spin.

"Title:
Mass freezing in growing neutrino quintessence","
Abstract: Growing neutrino quintessence solves the coincidence problem for dark energy
by a growing cosmological value of the neutrino mass which emerges from a
cosmon-neutrino interaction stronger than gravity. The cosmon-mediated
attraction between neutrinos induces the formation of large scale neutrino
lumps in a recent cosmological epoch. We argue that the non-linearities in the
cosmon field equations stop the further increase of the neutrino mass within
sufficiently dense and large lumps. As a result, we find the neutrino induced
gravitational potential to be substantially reduced when compared to linear
extrapolations. We furthermore demonstrate that inside a lump the possible time
variation of fundamental constants is much smaller than their cosmological
evolution. This feature may reconcile current geophysical bounds with claimed
cosmological variations of the fine structure constant.

"Title:
Temporal Relation between Disappearance of Penumbral Fine-Scale  Structure and Evershed Flow","
Abstract: We investigate the temporal relation between the Evershed flow, dot-like
bright features (penumbral grain), the complex magnetic field structure, and
dark lanes (dark core) along bright filaments in a sunspot penumbra. We use a
time series of high spatial resolution photospheric intensity, vector magnetic
field maps, and Doppler velocity maps obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope
aboard the \textit{Hinode} spacecraft. We conclude that the appearance and
disappearance of the Evershed flow and penumbra grains occur at nearly the same
time and are associated with changes of the inclination angle of the magnetic
field from vertical to more horizontal. This supports the idea that Evershed
flow is a result of thermal convection in the inclined field lines. The dark
core of the bright penumbral filament also appears coincidental with the
Evershed flow. However, the dark-cored bright filament survives at least for
10-20 minutes after the disappearance of the Evershed flow. The heat input into
the bright filament continues after the end of heat transfer by the Evershed
flow. This suggests that local heating along the bright filament is important
to maintain the brightness of the bright filament in addition to the heat
transfer by the Evershed flow.

A study of NIR atmospheric properties at Paranal Observatory","
Abstract: In order to maximize the scientific return of the telescopes located at the
Paranal Observatory, we analyse the properties of the atmosphere above Paranal
in the near-infrared (NIR). We estimate atmospheric extinction in the spectral
range 1.10-2.30 um (J, Js, H, and Ks) using standard stars that were observed
during photometric and clear nights with ISAAC on the Very Large Telescope UT1
between 2000 and 2004. We have built a database consisting of hundreds of
observations, which allows us to examine how extinction varies with airmass and
the column density of water vapour. In addition, we use theoretical models of
the atmosphere to estimate Rayleigh scattering and molecular absorption in
order to quantify their fractional contribution to the total extinction in each
filter. Finally, we have observed 8 bright red standard stars to evaluate
filter color terms. We find that extinction coefficients are < 0.1 mag/airmass
in all the considered bands. The extinction coefficient in the J-band strongly
depends on the column density of water vapour. Molecular absorption dominates
the extinction in J, H and Ks, while Rayleigh scattering contributes most to
the extinction in Js. We have found negligible color terms for J, H and Ks and
a non-negligible color term for Js.

Lyman alpha emission from the first galaxies: Signatures of accretion  and infall in the presence of line trapping","
Abstract: The formation of the first galaxies is accompanied by large accretion flows
and virialization shocks, during which the gas is shock-heated to temperatures
of $\sim10^4$ K, leading to potentially strong fluxes in the Lyman alpha line.
Indeed, a number of Lyman alpha blobs has been detected at high redshift. In
this letter, we explore the origin of such Lyman alpha emission using
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include a detailed model of atomic
hydrogen as a multi-level atom and the effects of line trapping with the
adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH. We see that baryons fall into the center
of a halo through cold streams of gas, giving rise to a Lyman alpha luminosity
of at least $\rm 10^{44} erg s^{-1}$ at $\rm z=4.7$, similar to observed Lyman
alpha blobs. We find that a Lyman alpha flux of $\rm 5.0\times 10^{-17} erg
cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ emerges from the envelope of the halo rather than its center,
where the photons are efficiently trapped. Such emission can be probed in
detail with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and will constitute
an important probe of gas infall and accretion.

Overview of open issues in the physics of large solar flares","
Abstract: A broad variety of observational methods allows us to see the effect of
magnetic reconnection in high-temperature strongly-magnetized plasma of the
solar corona. Some specific features of the large-scale reconnection in large
solar flares are summarized in this review but they are not investigated in
detail yet. For example, an analysis of the topological peculiarities of
magnetic field in active regions clearly shows that the so-called topological
trigger phenomenon is necessary to allow for in order to construct realistic
models for large solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). However this
is not a simple task. We discuss also some new analytical models of magnetic
reconnection in a current layer with attached MHD discontinuities. These models
take into account the possibility of a current layer rupture in the region of
anomalous plasma resistivity. In the context of the numerical simulations on
reconnection, a question on their interpretation is considered. Some new
results obtained recently are briefly reviewed together with new questions of
the solar flare physics to be studied.

Magnetar Asteroseismology with Long-Term Gravitational Waves","
Abstract: Magnetic flares and induced oscillations of magnetars (super-magnetized
neutron stars) are promising sources of gravitational waves (GWs). We suggest
that the GW emission, if any, would last longer than the observed X-ray
quasi-periodic oscillations (X-QPOs), calling for the longer-term GW analyses
from a day to months than the current searches. Like the pulsar timing, the
oscillation frequency would also evolve with time because of the decay or
reconfiguration of magnetic field, which is crucial for the GW detection. With
the observed GW frequency and its time-derivatives, we can probe the interior
magnetic field strength and its evolution to open a new GW asteroseismology
with the next generation interferometers like advanced LIGO, advanced VIRGO,

Synthetic Observations of Simulated AGN Jets: X-ray Cavities","
Abstract: Observations of X-ray cavities formed by powerful jets from AGN in galaxy
cluster cores are widely used to estimate the energy output of the AGN. Using
methods commonly applied to observations of clusters, we conduct synthetic
X-ray observations of 3D MHD simulated jet-ICM interactions to test the
reliability of measuring X-ray cavity power. These measurements are derived
from empirical estimates of the enthalpy content of the cavities and their
implicit ages. We explore how such physical factors as jet intermittency and
observational conditions such as orientation of the jets with respect to the
line of sight impact the reliability of observational measurements of cavity
enthalpy and age. An estimate of the errors in these quantities can be made by
directly comparing ""observationally"" derived values with ""actual"" values from
the simulations. In our tests, cavity enthalpy derived from observations was
typically within a factor of two of the simulation values. Cavity age and,
therefore, cavity power are sensitive to the accuracy of the estimated
inclination angle of the jets. Cavity age and power estimates within a factor
of two of the actual values are possible given an accurate inclination angle.

Deep Infrared ZAMS Fits to Benchmark Open Clusters Hosting delta Scuti  Stars","
Abstract: This research aims to secure precise distances for cluster delta Scutis in
order to investigate their properties via a VI Wesenheit framework. Deep JHKs
colour-colour and ZAMS relations derived from ~700 unreddened stars featuring
2MASS photometry and precise HIP parallaxes (d<~25 pc) are applied to establish
distances to several benchmark open clusters that host delta Scutis: Hyades,
Pleiades, Praesepe, alpha Per, and M67 (d=47+-2,138+-6,183+-8,171+-8,815+-40
pc). That analysis provided constraints on the delta Sct sample's absolute
Wesenheit magnitudes (W_VI,0), evolutionary status, and pulsation modes (order,
n). The reliability of JHKs established cluster parameters is demonstrated via
a comparison with van Leeuwen 2009 revised HIP results. Distances for 7 of 9
nearby (d<250 pc) clusters agree, and the discrepant cases (Pleiades & Blanco
1) are unrelated to (insignificant) Te/J-Ks variations with cluster age or
[Fe/H]. JHKs photometry is tabulated for ~3x10^3 probable cluster members on
the basis of proper motions (NOMAD). The deep JHKs photometry extends into the
low mass regime (~0.4 Msun) and ensures precise (<5%) ZAMS fits. Pulsation
modes inferred for the cluster delta Scutis from VI Wesenheit and independent
analyses are comparable (+-n), and the methods are consistent in identifying
higher order pulsators. Most small-amplitude cluster delta Scutis lie on VI
Wesenheit loci characterizing n>~1 pulsators. A distance established to NGC
1817 from delta Scutis (d~1.7 kpc) via a universal VI Wesenheit template agrees
with estimates in the literature, assuming the variables delineate the n>~1
boundary. Small statistics in tandem with other factors presently encumber the
use of mmag delta Scutis as viable distance indicators to intermediate-age open
clusters, yet a VI Wesenheit approach is a pertinent means for studying delta
Scutis in harmony with other methods.

Abstract: We present the results of time-resolved optical photometry and spectroscopy

during 2000 and 2008 reveals the presence of the secondary star's ellipsoidal

brighter than its quiescence level and the ellipsoidal modulation diluted by
strong flaring activity. Spectroscopic data obtained with the 10.4-m GTC in
2010 reveals radial velocity variations of ~500 km/s over 3 h. A simultaneous
fit to the photometry and spectroscopy using sinusoids to represent the
secondary star's ellipsoidal and radial velocity variations, yields an orbital

K_2= 541+-70 km/s. The implied mass function is f(M)=4.5+-0.6 Msun,
significantly lower than previously reported but consistent with the presence
of a black hole in XTE J1859+226. The lack of eclipses sets an upper limit to
the inclination of 70 degrees which yields a lower limit to the black hole mass
of 5.42 Msun.

An Improved Spectroscopic Analysis of DA White Dwarfs from the Sloan  Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4","
Abstract: We present an improved spectroscopic and photometric analysis of

non-ideal gas effects. We also perform a careful visual inspection of all
spectroscopic fits with high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N > 12) and present
improved atmospheric parameters (Teff and log g) for each white dwarf. Through
a comparison of spectroscopic and photometric temperatures, we report the
discovery of 35 DA+DB/DC double degenerate candidates and 2 helium-rich DA
stars. We also determine that a cutoff at S/N = 15 optimizes the size and
quality of the sample for computing the mean mass of DA white dwarfs, for which
we report a value of 0.613 Msun. In the following step, we compare our results
to previous analyses of the SDSS DR4 and find a good agreement if we account
for the shift produced by the improved Stark profiles. Finally, the properties
of DA white dwarfs in the SDSS are weighed against those of the Villanova White
Dwarf Catalog sample of Gianninas et al. We find systematically lower masses
(by about 3% on average), a difference that we trace back to the data reduction
procedure of the SDSS. We conclude that a better understanding of these
differences will be important to determine the absolute temperature scale and
mean mass of DA white dwarfs.

Model atmospheres for massive gas giants with thick clouds: Application  to the HR 8799 planets and predictions for future detections","
Abstract: We have generated an extensive new suite of massive giant planet atmosphere
models and used it to obtain fits to photometric data for the planets HR 8799b,
c, and d. We consider a wide range of cloudy and cloud-free models. The cloudy
models incorporate different geometrical and optical thicknesses, modal
particle sizes, and metallicities. For each planet and set of cloud parameters,
we explore grids in gravity and effective temperature, with which we determine
constraints on the planet's mass and age. Our new models yield statistically
significant fits to the data, and conclusively confirm that the HR 8799 planets
have much thicker clouds than those required to explain data for typical L and
T dwarfs. Both models with 1) physically thick forsterite clouds and a
60-micron modal particle size and 2) clouds made of 1 micron-sized pure iron
droplets and 1% supersaturation fit the data. Current data are insufficient to
accurately constrain the microscopic cloud properties, such as composition and
particle size. The range of best-estimated masses for HR 8799b, HR 8799c, and
HR 8799d conservatively span 2-12 M_J, 6-13 M_J, and 3-11 M_J, respectively and
imply coeval ages between ~10 and ~150 Myr, consistent with previously reported
stellar age. The best-fit temperatures and gravities are slightly lower than
values obtained by Currie et al. (2011) using even thicker cloud models.
Finally, we use these models to predict the near-to-mid IR colors of soon-to-be
imaged planets. Our models predict that planet-mass objects follow a locus in
some near-to-mid IR color-magnitude diagrams that is clearly separable from the
standard L/T dwarf locus for field brown dwarfs.

Connections between Tilted Accretion Disks around White Dwarfs and  Substellar Companions","
Abstract: Accretion disks in white dwarf systems are believed to be tilted. In a recent
publication, the lift force has been suggested to be a source to disk tilt, a
source that is likely relevant to all accretion disk systems. Lift is generated
by slightly different supersonic gas stream speeds flowing over and under the
disk at the bright spot. In this conference proceeding, we focus on whether a
brown dwarf donor star accreting onto a white dwarf primary has enough mass to
contribute to disk tilt. We also would like to obtain whether a white dwarf -
brown dwarf close binary system has enough mass to induce and maintain a disk
tilt of four degrees. We adopt SDSS 103533.03+055158.4 as our model system
which has a mass transfer rate of (10 \pm 2) x 10-12 M* yr-1. We find that the
brown dwarf in SDSS 1035 does not have enough mass to contribute to disk tilt.
We find a gross magnitude of the minimum mass transfer rate to be - 10-10 M*
yr-1 . We conclude that SDSS 1035 does not seem to have a high enough mass
transfer rate to induce and maintain an observable disk tilt. Hence one reason
why brown dwarf donor systems may be so difficult to find could be due to their
low mass transfer rates which do not induce observable dynamical effects that
is typical in white dwarf-red dwarf CVs.

Chandrasekhar and Modern Stellar Dynamics","
Abstract: Stellar dynamics occupied Chandrasekhar's interest for a brief interlude
between his more prolonged studies of stellar structure and radiative transfer.
This paper traces the history of one of his ideas -- namely, that the shape of
the galactic potential controls the orientation of the stellar velocity
dispersion tensor. It has its roots in papers by Eddington (1915) and
Chandrasekhar (1939), and provoked a fascinating dispute between these two
great scientists -- less well-known than their famous controversy over the

curves of the eigenvectors of the velocity dispersion tensor provide a
one-dimensional foliation into mutually orthogonal surfaces. Chandrasekhar
challenged this, and explicitly constructed a counter-example. In fact, the
work of neither of these great scientists was without flaws, though further
developments in stellar dynamics were to ultimately draw more on Eddington's
insight than Chandrasekhar's. We conclude with a description of modern attempts
to measure the orientation of the velocity dispersion tensor for populations in
the Milky Way Galaxy, a subject that is coming into its own with the dawning of
the Age of Precision Astrometry.

indicate that at distances less than a few kpc from a given HMXB, it is more
likely to have neighbors that are known massive-star forming regions as opposed
to objects drawn from random distributions. The characteristic scale of the

Arp220: extinction and merger-induced star formation","
Abstract: We analyse new spatially resolved integral field spectroscopic H- and K-band
data at a resolution of 0.3arcsec (100pc) and re-analyse interferometric
CO(2-1) line observations of the prototypical merging system Arp220. We find
that the majority of the K-band luminosity is due to a 10Myr old starburst,
with a significant contribution from an underlying ca 1Gyr old stellar
population, and a small contribution from stars less than 8Myr old. The
Calzetti (2000) reddening law provides the best fit to photometric datapoints
spanning 0.45um -- 2.12um. Furthermore, estimates of the bolometric luminosity
from IRAS fluxes in conjunction with our stellar population analysis indicate
that we observe less than 10% of the emitted K-band light. The stellar and
CO(2-1) kinematic centre of the western nucleus coincides with the compact hot
dust emission, indicating that the latter marks the centre of the gravitational
potential. In the eastern nucleus, the CO(2-1) data are well matched by a model
in which the gas orbits around the peak of the dust emission. This, and the
similarity of the K-band tracer kinematics, shows that despite the irregular
morphology, the eastern nucleus is also a kinematically coherent structure.
Comparison of the extinction map and EW_CO and EW_Br-gamma maps indicates that
the lower half of the eastern nucleus is significantly more extincted than the
upper half, suggesting that the lower half is buried in the larger-scale gas
disk.

outbursts. Previous suggestions of bimodal distributions of the amplitudes and
widths of the outbursts are confirmed. The outbursts occur at a mean spacing of
18 days but the range of spacings is large (13-30 days). From simulations of
dwarf nova outbursts it has been predicted that the outburst spacing in V446
Her will increase as M-dot from the red dwarf companion slowly falls following
the nova; however the large intrinsic scatter in the spacings serves to hide
any evidence of this effect. We do find a systematic change in the outburst
pattern in which the brighter, wider type of outbursts disappeared after late
2003, and this phenomenon is suggested to be due to falling M-dot following the
nova.

Evidence for gravitational quadrupole moment variations in the companion  of PSR J2051-0827","
Abstract: We have conducted radio timing observations of the eclipsing millisecond
binary pulsar J2051-0827 with the European Pulsar Timing Array network of
telescopes and the Parkes radio telescope, spanning over 13 years. The
increased data span allows significant measurements of the orbital
eccentricity, e = (6.2 {\pm} 1.3) {\times} 10^{-5} and composite proper motion,
{\mu}_t = 7.3 {\pm} 0.4 mas/yr. Our timing observations have revealed secular
variations of the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar orbit which are much
more extreme than those previously published; and of the orbital period of the
system. Investigation of the physical mechanisms producing such variations
confirm that the variations of the semi-major axis are most probably caused by
classical spin-orbit coupling in the binary system, while the variations in
orbital period are most likely caused by tidal dissipation leading to changes
in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion.

"Title:
A Sagittarius-Induced Origin for the Monoceros Ring","
Abstract: The Monoceros ring is a collection of stars in nearly-circular orbits at
roughly 18 kpc from the Galactic center. It may have originated (i) as the
response of the disc to perturbations excited by satellite companions or (ii)
from the tidal debris of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. The metallicity of Monoceros
stars differs from that of disc stars at comparable Galactocentric distances,
an observation that disfavours the first scenario. On the other hand, circular
orbits are difficult to accommodate in the tidal-disruption scenario, since it
requires a satellite which at the time of disruption was itself in a nearly
circular orbit. Such satellite could not have formed at the location of the
ring and, given its low mass, dynamical friction is unlikely to have played a
major role in its orbital evolution. We search cosmological simulations for
low-mass satellites in nearly-circular orbits and find that they result, almost
invariably, from orbital changes induced by collisions with more massive
satellites: the radius of the circular orbit thus traces the galactocentric
distance of the collision. Interestingly, the Sagittarius dwarf, one of the
most luminous satellites of the Milky Way, is in a polar orbit that crosses the
Galactic plane at roughly the same Galactocentric distance as Monoceros. We use
idealized simulations to demonstrate that an encounter with Sagittarius might
well have led to the circularization and subsequent tidal demise of the
progenitor of the Monoceros ring.

"Title:
Radio structure of the blazar 1156+295 with sub-pc resolution","
Abstract: 1156+295 is a flat-spectrum quasar which is loud at radio and gamma-ray.
Previous observations of the source revealed a radio morphology on pc to kpc
scales consistent with a helical jet model. In our present research, this
source was observed with the VLBA at 86, 43 and 15 GHz on four epochs from 10
May 2003 to 13 March 2005 aiming at studying the structure of the innermost jet
in order to understand the relation between the helical structure and the
astrophysical processes in the central engine. A core-jet structure with six
jet components is identified. The apparent transverse velocities of the six jet
components derived from proper motion measurements are in the range between 3.6
c and 11.6 c. The overall jet shape shows oscillatory morphology with multiple
curvatures on pc scales which might be indicative of a helical pattern. Models
of helical jet are discussed on the basis of both Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H)
instability and jet precession. The K-H instability model shows better
agreement with the observed data. The overall radio structure on the scale from
sub-pc to kpc appears to be fitted with a hydrodynamic model with the
fundamental helical mode in Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability. This helical
mode with an initial characteristic wavelength of 0.2 pc is excited at the base
of the jet on the scale of 0.005 pc (or 1000R_s, the typical size of the broad
line region for a super massive black hole of $4.3\times10^8M_{\odot}$). A
presessing jet model can also fit the observed jet structure on the scale
between 10 pc and 300 pc. However, additional astrophysical processes may be
required for the presessing jet model in order to explain the bendings on the
inner jet structure (1 to 10 pc) and re-collimation of the large scale jet
outflow (>300 pc).

Abstract: We examined six exoplanet host stars with non-standard Hipparcos astrometric
solution, which may be indicative of unrecognised orbital motion. Using
Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data, we detected the astrometric orbit of
HD 5388 at a significance level of 99.4 % (2.7 sigma). HD 5388 is a
metal-deficient star and hosts a planet candidate with a minimum mass of 1.96

+0.4/-0.7 deg and the corresponding mass of its companion HD 5388 b to be M_2 =
69 +/- 20 M_J. The orbit is seen almost face-on and the companion mass lies at
the upper end of the brown-dwarf mass range. A mass lower than 13 M_J was
excluded at the 3-sigma level. The astrometric motions of the five other stars
had been investigated by other authors revealing two planetary companions, one
stellar companion, and two statistically insignificant orbits. We conclude that
HD 5388 b is not a planet but most likely a brown-dwarf companion. In addition,

Spherical galaxy models as equilibrium configurations in nonextensive  statistics","
Abstract: Considering galaxies as self - gravitating systems of many collisionless
particles allows to use methods of statistical mechanics inferring the
distribution function of these stellar systems. Actually, the long range nature
of the gravitational force contrasts with the underlying assumptions of
Boltzmann statistics where the interactions among particles are assumed to be
short ranged. A particular generalization of the classical Boltzmann formalism
is available within the nonextensive context of Tsallis q -statistics, subject
to non -additivity of the entropies of sub - systems. Assuming stationarity and
isotropy in the velocity space, it is possible solving the generalized
collsionless Boltzmann equation to derive the galaxy distribution function and
density profile. We present a particular set of nonextensive models and
investigate their dynamical and observable properties. As a test of the
viability of this generalized context, we fit the rotation curve of M33 showing
that the proposed approach leads to dark matter haloes in excellent agreement
with the observed data.

"Title:
Meridional circulation in turbulent protoplanetary disks","
Abstract: Based on the viscous disk theory, a number of recent studies have suggested
there is large scale meridional circulation in protoplanetary disks. Such a
flow could account for the presence of crystalline silicates, including
calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), at large distances from the sun.
This paper aims at examining whether such large-scale flows exist in turbulent
protoplanetary disks. High-resolution global hydrodynamical and
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations of turbulent protoplanetary
disks were used to infer the properties of the flow in such disks. By
performing hydrodynamic simulations using explicit viscosity, we demonstrate
that our numerical setup does not suffer from any numerical artifact. The
aforementioned meridional circulation is easily recovered in viscous and
laminar disks and is quickly established. In MHD simulations, the
magnetorotational instability drives turbulence in the disks. Averaging out the
turbulent fluctuations on a long timescale, the results fail to show any
large-scale meridional circulation. A detailed analysis of the simulations show
that this lack of meridional circulation is due to the turbulent stress tensor
having a vertical profile different from the viscous stress tensor. A simple
model is provided that successfully accounts for the structure of the flow in
the bulk of the disk. In addition to those results, possible deviations from
standard vertically averaged alpha disk models are suggested by the simulations
and should be the focus of future work. Global MHD numerical simulations of
fully ionized and turbulent protoplanetary disks are not consistent with the
existence of a large-scale meridional flow. As a consequence, the presence of
crystalline silicates at large distance for the central star cannot be
accounted for by that process as suggested by recent models based on viscous
disk theory.

South Pole Telescope Detections of the Previously Unconfirmed Planck  Early SZ Clusters in the Southern Hemisphere","
Abstract: We present South Pole Telescope (SPT) observations of the five galaxy cluster
candidates in the southern hemisphere which were reported as unconfirmed in the

G255.62-46.16, is located in the 2500-square-degree SPT SZ survey region and
was reported previously as SPT-CL J0411-4819. For the remaining four
candidates, which are located outside of the SPT SZ survey region, we performed
short, dedicated SPT observations. Each of these four candidates was strongly
detected in maps made from these observations, with signal-to-noise ratios
ranging from 6.3 to 13.8. We have observed these four candidates on the
Magellan-Baade telescope and used these data to estimate cluster redshifts from
the red sequence. Resulting redshifts range from 0.24 to 0.46. We report
measurements of Y_0.75', the integrated Comptonization within a 0.75' radius,
for all five candidates. We also report X-ray luminosities calculated from
ROSAT All-Sky Survey catalog counts, as well as optical and improved SZ
coordinates for each candidate. The combination of SPT SZ measurements, optical
red-sequence measurements, and X-ray luminosity estimates demonstrates that

Photometric and Spectroscopic Evolution of the Type IIP SN 2007it to Day  944","
Abstract: SN 2007it is a bright, Type IIP supernova which shows indications of both
pre-existing and newly formed dust. The visible photometry shows a bright
late-time luminosity, powered by the 0.09 M$_{\sun}$ of $^{56}$Ni present in
the ejecta. There is also a sudden drop in optical brightness after day 339,
and a corresponding brightening in the IR due to new dust forming in the
ejecta. CO and SiO emission, generally thought to be precursors to dust
formation, may have been detected in the mid-IR photometry of SN 2007it. The
optical spectra show stronger than average [O I] emission lines and weaker than
average [Ca II] lines, which may indicate a 16 - 27 M$_{\sun}$ progenitor, on
the higher end of expected Type IIP masses. Multi-component [O I] lines are
also seen in the optical spectra, most likely caused by an asymmetric blob or a
torus of oxygen core material being ejected during the SN explosion.
Interaction with circumstellar material prior to day 540 may have created a
cool dense shell between the forward and reverse shocks where new dust is
condensing. At late times there is also a flattening of the visible lightcurve
as the ejecta luminosity fades and a surrounding light echo becomes visible.
Radiative transfer models of SN 2007it SEDs indicate that up to 10$^{-4}$
M$_{\sun}$ of new dust has formed in the ejecta, which is consistent with the
amount of dust formed in other core collapse supernovae.

Transport of magnetic flux from the canopy to the internetwork","
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed that 8% of linear polarization patches in
the internetwork quiet Sun are fully embedded in downflows. These are not
easily explained with the typical scenarios for the source of internetwork
fields which rely on flux emergence from below. We explore using radiative MHD
simulations a scenario where magnetic flux is transported from the magnetic
canopy overlying the internetwork into the photosphere by means of downward
plumes associated with convective overshoot. We find that if a canopy-like
magnetic field is present in the simulation, the transport of flux from the
canopy is an important process for seeding the photospheric layers of the
internetwork with magnetic field. We propose that this mechanism is relevant
for the Sun as well, and it could naturally explain the observed internetwork
linear polarization patches entirely embedded in downflows.

A double radio relic in the merging galaxy cluster ZwCl 0008.8+5215","
Abstract: Some merging galaxy clusters host diffuse elongated radio sources, also
called radio relics. It is proposed that these radio relics trace shock waves
in the intracluster medium created during a cluster merger event. Within the
shock waves particles are accelerated to relativistic energies, and in the
presence of a magnetic field synchrotron radiation will be emitted. Here we
present GMRT and WSRT observations of a new double relic in the galaxy cluster
ZwCl 0008.8+5215. Optical V, R, and I band images of the cluster were taken
with the INT. An optical spectrum, to determine the redshift of the cluster,
was taken with the WHT. Our observations show the presence of a double radio
relic in the galaxy cluster ZwCl 0008.8+5215, for which we find a spectroscopic
redshift of z = 0.1032 \pm 0.0018 from an optical spectrum of one of the cD
galaxies. The spectral index of the two relics steepens inwards to the cluster
center. For part of the relics, we measure a polarization fraction in the range
~ 5-25%. A ROSAT X-ray image displays an elongated ICM and the large-scale
distribution of galaxies reveals two cluster cores, all pointing towards a
binary cluster merger event. The radio relics are located symmetrically with
respect to the X-ray center of the cluster, along the proposed merger axis. The
relics have a linear extent of 1.4 Mpc and 290 kpc. This factor of five
difference in linear size is unlike that of previously known double relic
systems, for which the sizes do not differ by more than a factor of two. We
conclude that the double relics in ZwCl 0008.8+5215 are best explained by two
outward moving shock waves in which particles are (re)accelerated trough the
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism. [abridged]

Dark Energy from ferromagnetic condensation of cosmic magninos","
Abstract: It is proposed that an ultra-light fermionic species, dubbed cosmic magnino

magnetic moment of the cosmic magnino. The proposed magnetism is supposed to be

electrically charged under this electromagnetism, the corresponding oppositely
charged heavier species would account partially or entirely for the Dark Matter

Observational Signatures of Lyman Alpha Emission from Early Galaxy  Formation","
Abstract: The next generation of telescopes aim to directly observe the first
generation of galaxies that initiated the reionization process in our Universe.
The Lyman Alpha (Lya) emission line is robustly predicted to be the most
prominent intrinsic spectral feature of these galaxies, making it an ideal
target to search for and study high-redshift galaxies. I briefly discuss why
Lya emitting galaxies (LAEs) provide a good probe of the intergalactic medium
(IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). I argue that if we wish to fully
exploit LAEs as a probe of the EoR, it is important to understand what drives
their observed redshift evolution after reionization is completed. One
important uncertainty in interpreting existing LAE observations relates to the
impact of the ionized IGM on Lya photons emitted by galaxies, which is strongly
connected to the effects of scattering through HI in galactic outflows.
Scattering through galactic outflows can also modify the Lya spectral line
shape such that > 5% of the emitted Lya radiation is transmitted directly to
the observer, even through a fully neutral IGM. Finally, I discuss what is
required --observationally and theoretically-- to resolve the uncertainties
that affect existing interpretations of data on LAEs.

A pre-outburst signal in the long term optical lightcurve of the  recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi","
Abstract: Recurrent novae are binary stars in which a white dwarf accretes matter from
a less evolved companion, either a red giant or a main-sequence star. They have
dramatic optical brightenings of around 5-6 mag in V in less than a day,
several times a century. These occur at variable and unpredictable intervals,
and are followed by an optical decline over several weeks, and activity from
the X-ray to the radio. The unpredictability of recurrent novae and related
stellar types can hamper systematic study of their outbursts. Here we analyse
the long-term lightcurve of RS Ophiuchi, a recurrent nova with six confirmed
outbursts, most recently in 2006 February. We confirm the previously suspected
1945 outburst, largely obscured in a seasonal gap. We also find a signal via
wavelet analysis that can be used to predict an incipient outburst up to a few
hundred days before hand. This has never before been possible. In addition this
may suggest that the preferred thermonuclear runaway mechanism for the
outbursts will have to be modified, as no pre-outburst signal is anticipated in
that case. If our result indeed points to gaps in our understanding of how
outbursts are driven, we will need to study such objects carefully to determine
if the white dwarf is growing in mass, an essential factor if these systems are
to become Type Ia Supernovae. Determining the likelihood of recurrent novae
being an important source population will have implications for stellar and
galaxy evolution.

"Title:
Conversion from linear to circular polarization in FPGA","
Abstract: Context: Radio astronomical receivers are now expanding their frequency range
to cover large (octave) fractional bandwidths for sensitivity and spectral
flexibility, which makes the design of good analogue circular polarizers
challenging. Better polarization purity requires a flatter phase response over
increasingly wide bandwidth, which is most easily achieved with digital
techniques. They offer the ability to form circular polarization with perfect
polarization purity over arbitrarily wide fractional bandwidths, due to the
ease of introducing a perfect quadrature phase shift. Further, the rapid
improvements in field programmable gate arrays provide the high processing
power, low cost, portability and reconfigurability needed to make practical the
implementation of the formation of circular polarization digitally. Aims: Here
we explore the performance of a circular polarizer implemented with digital
techniques. Methods: We designed a digital circular polarizer in which the
intermediate frequency signals from a receiver with native linear polarizations
were sampled and converted to circular polarization. The frequency-dependent
instrumental phase difference and gain scaling factors were determined using an
injected noise signal and applied to the two linear polarizations to equalize
the transfer characteristics of the two polarization channels. This
equalization was performed in 512 frequency channels over a 512 MHz bandwidth.
Circular polarization was formed by quadrature phase shifting and summing the
equalized linear polarization signals. Results: We obtained polarization purity
of -25 dB corresponding to a D-term of 0.06 over the whole bandwidth.
Conclusions: This technique enables construction of broad-band radio astronomy
receivers with native linear polarization to form circular polarization for
VLBI.

Abstract: We present the results of a ground-based, high spatial resolution infrared 18
micron imaging study of nearby luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), using the

routinely achieved with these telescopes in the Q-band (17-23 micron) allow us
to investigate the detailed spatial distribution of infrared emission in these

modest, as observed in starbursts, or are so high that luminous active galactic
nuclei (AGNs; high emission surface brightness energy sources) are indicated.
The sample consists of 18 luminous buried AGN candidates and
starburst-classified LIRGs identified in earlier infrared spectroscopy. We find
that the infrared 18 micron emission from the buried AGN candidates is
generally compact, and the estimated emission surface brightnesses are high,
sometimes exceeding the maximum value observed in and theoretically predicted
for a starburst phenomenon. The starburst-classified LIRGs usually display
spatially extended 18 micron emission and the estimated emission surface
brightnesses are modest, within the range sustained by a starburst phenomenon.
The general agreement between infrared spectroscopic and imaging energy
diagnostic methods suggests that both are useful tools for understanding the
hidden energy sources of the dusty LIRG population.

interest for the estimation of solar coronal rotation using flux modulation
approach. These studies established that the solar corona rotates
differentially. The radio images estimate equatorial rotation period lower than
those estimated by the X-ray images. The latitude profiles of the coronal
rotation have temporal variability. The space-time plots of sidereal rotation
period, interestingly, display clear North-South asymmetry. The asymmetry
appears to change its sign in odd and even activity cycles of the Sun.

Dynamics of the quantum vacuum: Cosmology as relaxation to the  equilibrium state","
Abstract: The behavior of the gravitating vacuum energy density in an expanding
universe is discussed. A scenario is presented with a step-wise relaxation of
the vacuum energy density. The vacuum energy density moves from plateau to
plateau and follows, on average, the steadily decreasing matter energy density.
The current plateau with a small positive value of the vacuum energy density
(effective cosmological constant) may result from a still not equilibrated
contribution of the light massive neutrinos to the quantum vacuum.

Calculation of High Energy Neutrino-Nucleon Cross Sections and  Uncertainties Using the MSTW Parton Distribution Functions and Implications  for Future Experiments","
Abstract: We present a new calculation of the cross sections for charged current (CC)

energy range $10^{4}<E_{\nu}<10^{12}$ GeV using the most recent MSTW parton

distributions for ease of use in Monte Carlo simulations. For the latter we
only provide parametrizations for energies above $10^7$ GeV. Finally, we assess
the feasibility of future neutrino experiments to constrain the $\nu N$ cross
section in the ultra-high energy (UHE) regime using a technique that is
independent of the flux spectrum of incident neutrinos. A significant deviation
from the predicted Standard Model cross sections could be an indication of new
physics, such as extra space-time dimensions, and we present expected
constraints on such models as a function of the number of events observed in a

A Multiphase Absorber Containing O VI and Broad H I Directly Tracing  10^6 K Plasma at Low-Redshift Toward HE 0153-4520","
Abstract: Observations of the QSO HE 0153-4520 (z-em = 0.450) with the Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph (COS) from 1134 to 1796 A with a resolution of ~17 km/s and
signal-to- noise per resolution element of 20 to 40 are used to study a
multi-phase partial Lyman limit system (LLS) at z = 0.22601 tracing both cool
and hot gas. FUSE observations of the Lyman limit break yield log N(H I) =
16.61(0.12, -0.17) The observed UV absorption lines of H I 1216 to 926, C III,
C II, N III, N II, Si III, and Si II imply the existence of cool photoionized
gas in the LLS with log U = -2.8\pm0.1 and log N(H) = 19.35\pm0.18, log n(H) =
-2.9\pm0.2, log T = 4.27\pm0.02, log (P/k) = 1.75\pm0.17, and log L(kpc) =
0.70\pm0.25. The abundances are [X/H] = -0.8 (+0.3, -0.2) for N, Si and C but
the result is sensitive to the assumed shape of the ionizing background
radiation field. The multi-phase system has strong O VI and associated broad Ly
{\alpha} absorption (BLA) with log N(O VI) = 14.21\pm0.02, b(O VI) = 37\pm1
km/s, log N(H I) = 13.70(+0.05,-0.08), b(H I)=140 (+14, -16) km/s and b(H
I)/b(O VI) = 3.9\pm0.4. The O VI does not arise in the cool photoionized gas of
the LLS. The O VI and BLA imply the direct detection of thermally broadened
absorption by hot gas with log T = 6.07 (+0.09, -0.12), [O/H] = -0.28 (+0.09,
-0.08), and log N(H) = 20.41 (+0.13, -0.17). The absorber probably occurs in

Observability of pulsar beam bending by the Sgr~A* black hole","
Abstract: According to some models, there may be a significant population of radio
pulsars in the Galactic center. In principle, a beam from one of these pulsars
could pass close to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center, be
deflected, and be detected by Earth telescopes. Such a configuration would be
an unprecedented probe of the properties of spacetime in the moderate- to
strong-field regime of the SMBH. We present here background on the problem, and
approximations for the probability of detection of such beams. We conclude that
detection is marginally probable with current telescopes, but that telescopes
that will be operating in the near future, with an appropriate multiyear
observational program, will have a good chance of detecting a beam deflected by

Growing Massive Black Holes in a Local Group Environment: the Central  Supermassive, Slowly Sinking, and Ejected Populations","
Abstract: We explore the growth of < 10^7 Msun black holes that reside at the centers
of spiral and field dwarf galaxies in a Local Group type of environment. We use
merger trees from a cosmological N-body simulation known as Via Lactea II
(VL-2) as a framework to test two merger-driven semi-analytic recipes for black
hole growth that include dynamical friction, tidal stripping, and gravitational
wave recoil in over 20,000 merger tree realizations. First, we apply a
Fundamental Plane limited (FPL) model to the growth of Sgr A*, which drives the
central black hole to a maximum mass limited by the Black Hole Fundamental
Plane after every merger. Next, we present a new model that allows for
low-level Prolonged Gas Accretion (PGA) during the merger. We find that both
models can generate a Sgr A* mass black hole. We predict a population of
massive black holes in local field dwarf galaxies - if the VL-2 simulation is
representative of the growth of the Local Group, we predict up to 35 massive
black holes (< 10^6 Msun) in Local Group field dwarfs. We also predict that
hundreds of < 10^5 Msun black holes fail to merge, and instead populate the
Milky Way halo, with the most massive of them at roughly the virial radius. In
addition, we find that there may be hundreds of massive black holes ejected
from their hosts into the nearby intergalactic medium due to gravitational wave
recoil. We discuss how the black hole population in the Local Group field
dwarfs may help to constrain the growth mechanism for Sgr A*.

"Title:
Maximally Star-Forming Galactic Disks I. Starburst Regulation Via  Feedback-Driven Turbulence","
Abstract: Star formation rates in the centers of disk galaxies often vastly exceed
those at larger radii. We investigate the idea that these central starbursts
are self-regulated, with the momentum flux injected to the ISM by star
formation balancing the gravitational force confining the gas. For most
starbursts, supernovae are the largest contributor to the momentum flux, and
turbulence provides the main pressure support for the predominantly-molecular
ISM. If the momentum feedback per stellar mass formed is p_*/m_* ~ 3000 km/s,
the predicted star formation rate is Sigma_SFR=2 pi G Sigma^2 m_*/p_*
~0.1(Sigma/100Msun/pc^2)^2 Msun/kpc^2/yr in regions where gas dominates the
vertical gravity. We compare this prediction with numerical simulations of
vertically-resolved disks that model star formation including feedback, finding
good agreement for gas surface densities Sigma ~ 10^2-10^3 Msun/pc^2. We also
compare to a compilation of star formation rates and gas contents from local
and high-redshift galaxies (both mergers and normal galaxies), finding good
agreement provided that X_CO decreases weakly as Sigma and Sigma_SFR increase.
Star formation rates in dense, turbulent gas are also expected to depend on the
gravitational free-fall time; if the efficiency per free-fall time is
epsilon_ff ~ 0.01, the turbulent velocity dispersion driven by feedback is
expected to be v_z = 0.4 epsilon_ff p_*/m_* ~ 10 km/s, relatively independent
of Sigma or Sigma_SFR. Turbulence-regulated starbursts (controlled by kinetic
momentum feedback) are part of the larger scheme of self-regulation;
primarily-atomic low-Sigma outer disks may have star formation regulated by UV
heating feedback, whereas regions at extremely high Sigma may be regulated by
feedback of radiation that is reprocessed into trapped IR.

The redshift and nature of AzTEC/COSMOS 1: A starburst galaxy at z=4.6","
Abstract: Based on broad/narrow-band photometry and Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy we report
a redshift of z=4.64-0.08+0.06 for AzTEC/COSMOS 1, the brightest sub-mm galaxy
in the AzTEC/COSMOS field. In addition to the COSMOS-survey X-ray to radio
data, we report observations of the source with Herschel/PACS (100, 160
micron), CSO/SHARC II (350 micron), CARMA and PdBI (3 mm). We do not detect
CO(5-4) line emission in the covered redshift ranges, 4.56-4.76 (PdBI/CARMA)
and 4.94-5.02 (CARMA). If the line is within this bandwidth, this sets 3sigma
upper limits on the gas mass to <~8x10^9 M_Sol and <~5x10^10 M_Sol,
respectively (assuming similar conditions as observed in z~2 SMGs). This could
be explained by a low CO-excitation in the source. Our analysis of the UV-IR
spectral energy distribution of AzTEC 1 shows that it is an extremely young
(<~50 Myr), massive (M*~10^11 M_Sol), but compact (<~2 kpc) galaxy forming
stars at a rate of ~1300 M_Sol/yr. Our results imply that AzTEC 1 is forming
stars in a 'gravitationally bound' regime in which gravity prohibits the
formation of a superwind, leading to matter accumulation within the galaxy and
further generations of star formation.

"Title:
uvbybeta photometry of early type open cluster and field stars","
Abstract: The beta Cephei stars and slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are massive main
sequence variables. The strength of their pulsational driving strongly depends
on the opacity of iron-group elements. As many of those stars naturally occur
in young open clusters, whose metallicities can be determined in several
fundamental ways, it is logical to study the incidence of pulsation in several
young open clusters. To provide the foundation for such an investigation,
Str\""omgren-Crawford uvbybeta photometry of open cluster target stars was
carried out to determine effective temperatures, luminosities, and therefore
cluster memberships. In the course of three observing runs, uvbybeta photometry
for 168 target stars was acquired and transformed into the standard system by
measurements of 117 standard stars. The list of target stars also included some
known cluster and field beta Cephei stars, as well as beta Cephei and SPB
candidates that are targets of the asteroseismic part of the Kepler satellite
mission. The uvbybeta photometric results are presented. The data are shown to
be on the standard system, and the properties of the target stars are
discussed: 140 of these are indeed OB stars, a total of 101 targets lie within
the beta Cephei and/or SPB star instability strips, and each investigated
cluster contains such potential pulsators. These measurements will be taken
advantage of in a number of subsequent publications.

Gravitational Wave Detection by Interferometry (Ground and Space)","
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in recent years on the development of
gravitational wave detectors. Sources such as coalescing compact binary
systems, neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, stellar collapses and
pulsars are all possible candidates for detection. The most promising design of
gravitational wave detector uses test masses a long distance apart and freely
suspended as pendulums on Earth or in drag-free craft in space. The main theme

Virgo (Italy/France), TAMA300 and LCGT (Japan), and GEO600 (Germany/U.K.) - and

create a network of detectors with significantly improved sensitivity required
to detect gravitational waves. Beyond this, the concept and design of possible
future ""third generation"" gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein

The distance duality relation and the temperature profile of Galaxy  Clusters","
Abstract: The validity of distance duality relation, $\eta=D_L(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_A(z)=1$,
an exact result required by the Etherington reciprocity theorem, where $D_A(z)$
and $D_L(z)$ are the angular and luminosity distances, plays an essential part
in cosmological observations and model constraints. In this paper, we
investigate some consequences of such a relation by assuming $\eta$ a constant
or a function of the redshift. In order to constrain the parameters concerning
$\eta$, we consider two groups of cluster gas mass fraction data including 52
X-ray luminous galaxy clusters observed by Chandra in the redshift range
$0.3\sim 1.273$ and temperature range $T_{\rm gas}> 4$ keV, under the
assumptions of two different temperature profiles [1]. We find that the
constant temperature profile is in relatively good agreement with no violation
of the distance duality relation for both parameterizations of $\eta$, while
the one with temperature gradient (the Vikhlinin et al. temperature profile)
seems to be incompatible even at 99% CL.

Lyman-alpha Emitters in Cosmological Simulations I: Lyman-alpha Escape  Fraction and Statistical Properties at z=3.1","
Abstract: We use very large cosmological Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics simulations to
study the properties of high redshift Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs). We identify
star-forming galaxies at z=3.1 in a cosmological volume of 100 h^-1Mpc on a
side. We develop a phenomenological model of absorption, scattering and escape
of Lyman-alpha photons on the assumption that the clumpiness of the
inter-stellar medium in a galaxy is correlated with the larger scale
substructure richness. The radiative transfer effect proposed by Neufeld (1991)
allows a large fraction of Lyman-alpha photons to escape from a clumpy galaxy
even if it contains a substantial amount of dust. Our model reproduces, for the
first time, all of the following observed properties of LAEs at z=3.1: the
angular correlation function, ultra-violet and Lyman-alpha luminosity
functions, and the equivalent width distribution. A simple model that takes
only dust absorption into account fails in matching the observational data,
suggesting that the kind of effect we consider is needed. Our model also
predicts a bimodal age distribution for LAEs. There are old, massive and dusty
LAEs, similar to recently found high redshift LAEs. The large LAEs have escape
fractions of Lyman-alpha photons of f_esc ~ 0.05-0.1.

Seyfert 2 galaxies in the GeV band: jets and starburst","
Abstract: The Fermi/LAT collaboration recently reported the detection of starburt
galaxies in the high energy gamma-ray domain, as well as radio-loud narrow-line
Seyfert 1 objects, which were previously unusual extragalactic suspects for
high energy emission. Motivated by the presence of sources close to the
location of composite starburst/Seyfert 2 galaxies in the first year Fermi/LAT
catalogue, we studied high energy gamma-ray emission from such objects, aiming
at disentangling the emission of starburst and Seyfert activity. We analysed
1.6 years of Fermi/LAT data from NGC 1068 and NGC 4945, which count among the
brightest Seyfert 2 galaxies. We found an excess of high energy gamma-rays of
8.3 sigmas and 9.2 sigmas for 1FGL J0242.7+0007 and 1FGL J1305.4-4928, which
are found to be consistent with the position of the Seyfert 2 galaxies NGC 1068
and NGC 4945, respectively. While the high energy flux of NGC 4945 is
consistent with starburst activity, that of NGC 1068 is an order of magnitude
above expectations, suggesting dominant emission from the active nucleus. We
show that a leptonic scenario can account for the multi-wavelength spectral
energy distribution of NGC 1068. High energy gamma-ray emission is thus
revealed for the first time in a Seyfert 2 galaxy. If this result is confirmed
in other objects, new perspectives would be opened up into the GeV band, with
the discovery of a new class of high energy gamma-ray emitters.

Discovery of the Zeeman Effect in the 44 GHz Class I methanol maser line","
Abstract: We report the discovery of the Zeeman effect in the 44 GHz Class I methanol
maser line. The observations were carried out with 22 antennas of the EVLA
toward a star forming region in OMC-2. Based on our adopted Zeeman splitting
factor of z = 1.0 Hz/mG, we detect a line of sight magnetic field of 18.4 +/-
1.1 mG toward this source. Since such 44 GHz methanol masers arise from shocks
in the outflows of star forming regions, we can relate our measurement of the
post-shock magnetic field to field strengths indicated by species tracing
pre-shock regions, and thus characterize the large scale magnetic field.
Moreover, since Class I masers trace regions more remote from the star forming
core than Class II masers, and possibly earlier phases, magnetic fields
detected in 6.7 GHz Class II and 36 GHz and 44 GHz Class I methanol maser lines
together offer the potential of providing a more complete picture of the
magnetic field. This motivates further observations at high angular resolution
to find the positional relationships between Class I and Class II masers, and
masers at various frequencies within each category. In particular, methanol
masers are widespread in high- as well as intermediate-mass star forming
regions, and our discovery provides a new method of studying the magnetic field
in such regions, by observing small physical scales that are not accessible by
any other lines.

CCDcamera system onboard the next X-ray astronomical satellite, ASTRO-H. It has
four identical channels that simultaneously process the CCD signals.
Distinctive capability of analog-to-digital conversion enables us to construct
a CCD camera body that outputs only digital signals. As the result of the
front-end electronics test, it works properly with low input noise of =<30 uV
at the pixel rate below 100 kHz. The power consumption is sufficiently low of
about 150 mW/chip. The input signal range of 720 mV covers the effective energy
range of the typical X-ray photon counting CCD (up to 20 keV). The integrated
non-linearity is 0.2% that is similar as those of the conventional CCDs in
orbit. We also performed a radiation tolerance test against the total ionizing
dose (TID) effect and the single event effect. The irradiation test using 60Co
and proton beam showed that the ASIC has the sufficient tolerance against TID
up to 200 krad, which absolutely exceeds the expected amount of dose during the
period of operating in a low-inclination low-earth orbit. The irradiation of Fe
ions with the fluence of 5.2x10^8 Ion/cm2 resulted in no single event latchup
(SEL), although there were some possible single event upsets. The threshold
against SEL is higher than 1.68 MeV cm^2/mg, which is sufficiently high enough
that the SEL event should not be one of major causes of instrument downtime in

Spectral curvature behavior during X-ray flares in GRB afterglow  emission","
Abstract: One of the most impressive recent discovery of SWIFT is the evidence that
X-ray flares occurring during the GRB afterglows are quite common, being
observed in roughly 50% of the afterglows. These X-ray flares range fluences
comparable with the GRB prompt emission and could be also repetitive. Several
pictures have been proposed on their origin and among them the most accepted
regards the internal shock scenario, interpreting the X-ray flares as late time
activity of the GRB central engine. We propose to describe the spectral shape
of the X-ray flares adopting the same physical model recently used to interpret
the GRB prompt emission: the log-parabolic function. In particular, we show
that their spectral energy distribution (SED) is remarkably curved, while no
significant curvature appears in the underlying X-ray afterglow emission. In
addition, the log-parabolic function is statistically favored with respect to
other proposed spectral models. By using a time resolved spectral analysis, we
show the evolution of the peak energy and the curvature parameters of the SED
during the X-ray flares in two of the brightest GRBs afterglows observed by
SWIFT. We found that in the X-ray flares there is an anti-correlation between
the peak energy and the curvature, as expected in a stochastic acceleration
scenario.

Chromospheric signatures of small-scale flux emergence as observed with  NST and Hinode instruments","
Abstract: With the ever increasing influx of high resolution images of the solar
surface obtained at a multitude of wavelengths, various processes occurring at
small spatial scales have become a greater focus of our attention. Complex
small-scale magnetic fields have been reported that appear to have enough
stored to heat the chromosphere. While significant progress has been made in
understanding small-scale phenomena, many specifics remain elusive. We present
here a detailed study of a single event of disappearance of a magnetic dipole
and associated chromospheric activity. Based on New Solar Telescope H$\alpha$
data and {\it Hinode} photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms and Ca II H
images we report the following. 1) Our analysis indicates that even very small
dipoles (elements separated by about 0\arcsec.5 or less) may reach the
chromosphere and trigger non-negligible chromospheric activity. 2) Careful
consideration of the magnetic environment where the new flux is deposited may
shed light on the details of magnetic flux removal from the solar surface. We
argue that the apparent collision and disappearance of two opposite polarity
elements may not necessarily indicate their cancellation (i.e., reconnection,
emergence of a ""U"" tube or submergence of $ \Omega $ loops). In our case, the
magnetic dipole disappeared by reconnecting with overlying large-scale inclined
plage fields. 3) Bright points seen in off-band H$\alpha$ images are very
well-correlated with the Ca II H bright points, which in turn are co-spatial
with G-band bright points. We further speculate that, in general, H$\alpha$
bright points are expected be co-spatial with photospheric BPs, however, a
direct comparison is needed to refine their relationship.

Abstract: We show the radial dependence of stellar baryon fraction curves derived for

of stellar population synthesis and pixel-based mass reconstruction. The sample
covers a stellar mass range of Ms~2x10^9-3x10^11 Msol (solar masses) which
corresponds to a total mass range of ML~7x10^9-3x10^12 Msol on scales from 0.25
to 5 Re (effective radii). By examining the Ms-to-ML dependence on radial
distance to the center of each galaxy we find pairs of lenses on small to
intermediate mass scales which approach at large radii the same values for
their enclosed total mass but exhibit very different stellar masses and stellar
baryon fractions. This behaviour subsides for the most massive lenses. All
baryon fraction profiles show that the dark matter halo overtakes the stellar
content between 1.5 and 2.5 Re. We find evidence for a stellar baryon fraction
steadily declining over the full mass range. We shed light on the Fundamental
Plane puzzle by showing that the slope of the ML(<R)-to-Ms(<R) relation
approaches the mass-to-light relation of recent Fundamental Plane studies at
large radii. Less massive dark matter halos turn out to be influenced by the
distribution of stellar matter on resolved scales below 10 kpc. The ongoing
study of resolved baryon fraction profiles will make it possible to evaluate
the validity of star formation models as well as adiabatic contraction
prescriptions commonly used in simulations. [abridged]

Abstract: Using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, we analyze the mid-infrared
(3-70 micron) spectral energy distributions of dry merger candidates in the
Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. These candidates were selected
by previous authors to be luminous, red, early-type galaxies with morphological
evidence of recent tidal interactions. We find that a significant fraction of
these candidates exhibit 8 and 24 micron excesses compared to expectations for
old stellar populations. We estimate that a quarter of dry merger candidates
have mid-infrared-derived star formation rates greater than ~1 MSun/yr. This
represents a ""frosting"" on top of a large old stellar population, and has been
seen in previous studies of elliptical galaxies. Further, the dry merger
candidates include a higher fraction of starforming galaxies relative to a
control sample without tidal features. We therefore conclude that the star
formation in these massive ellipticals is likely triggered by merger activity.
Our data suggest that the mergers responsible for the observed tidal features
were not completely dry, and may be minor mergers involving a gas-rich dwarf
galaxy.

Properties of the Compact HII Region Complex G-0.02-0.07","
Abstract: We present new extinction maps and high-resolution Paschen alpha images of
G-0.02-0.07, a complex of compact HII regions located adjacent to the
M-0.02-0.07 giant molecular cloud, 6 parsecs in projection from the center of
the Galaxy. These HII regions, which lie in projection just outside the
boundary of the Sgr A East supernova remnant, represent one of the most recent
episodes of star formation in the central parsecs of the Galaxy. The 1.87
micron extinctions of regions A, B and C are almost identical, approximately
1.5 magnitudes. Region D, in contrast, has a peak 1.87 micron extinction of 2.3
magnitudes. Adopting the Nishiyama et al. (2008) extinction law, we find these
extinctions correspond to visual extinctions of A_V = 44.5 and A_V = 70,
respectively. The similar and uniform extinctions of regions A, B and C are
consistent with that expected for foreground extinction in the direction of the
Galactic center, suggesting that they lie at the front side of the M-0.02-0.07
molecular cloud. Region D is more compact, has a higher extinction and is thus
suspected to be younger and embedded in a dense core in a compressed ridge on
the western edge of this cloud.

"Title:
On minor black holes in galactic nuclei","
Abstract: Small and intermediate mass black holes should be expected in galactic nuclei
as a result of stellar evolution, minor mergers and gravitational dynamical
friction. If these minor black holes accrete as X-ray binaries or
ultra-luminous X-ray sources, and are associated with star formation, they
could account for observations of many low luminosity AGN or LINERs. Accreting
and inspiralling intermediate mass black holes could provide a crucial
electromagnetic counterpart to strong gravitational wave signatures, allowing
tests of strong gravity. Here we discuss observational signatures of minor
black holes in galactic nuclei and we demonstrate that optical line ratios
observed in LINERs or transition-type objects can be produced by an ionizing
radiation field from ULXs. We conclude by discussing constraints from existing
observations as well as candidates for future study.

"Title:
Sodium-oxygen anticorrelation and neutron capture elements in Omega  Centauri stellar populations","
Abstract: Omega Centauri is no longer the only globular cluster known to contain
multiple stellar populations, yet it remains the most puzzling. Due to the
extreme way in which the multiple stellar population phenomenon manifests in
this cluster, it has been suggested that it may be the remnant of a larger
stellar system. In this work, we present a spectroscopic investigation of the
stellar populations hosted in the globular cluster Omega Centauri to shed light
on its, still puzzling, chemical enrichment history. With this aim we used
FLAMES+GIRAFFE@VLT to observe 300 stars distributed along the multimodal red
giant branch of this cluster, sampling with good statistics the stellar
populations of different metallicities. We determined chemical abundances for
Fe, Na, O, and n-capture elements Ba and La. We confirm that Omega Centauri
exhibits large star-to-star variations in iron with [Fe/H] ranging from ~ -2.0
to ~ -0.7 dex. Barium and lanthanum abundances of metal poor stars are
correlated with iron, up to [Fe/H] -1.5, while they are almost constant (or at
least have only a moderate increase) in the more metal rich populations. There
is an extended Na-O anticorrelation for stars with [Fe/H]<~ -1.3 while more
metal rich stars are almost all Na-rich. Sodium was found to midly increase
with iron over all the metallicity range.

"Title:
Faraday Rotation Measure Synthesis for Magnetic Fields of Galaxies","
Abstract: RM Synthesis was recently developed as a new tool for the interpretation of
polarized emission data in order to separate the contributions of different
sources lying on the same line of sight. Until now the method was mainly
applied to discrete sources in Faraday space (Faraday screens). Here we
consider how to apply RM Synthesis to reconstruct the Faraday dispersion
function, aiming at the further extraction of information concerning the
magnetic fields of extended sources, e.g. galaxies. The main attention is given
to two related novelties in the method, i.e. the symmetry argument in Faraday
space and the wavelet technique.
We give a relation between our method and the previous applications of RM
Synthesis to point-like sources. We demonstrate that the traditional RM
Synthesis for a point-like source indirectly implies a symmetry argument and,
in this sense, can be considered as a particular case of the method presented
here. Investigating the applications of RM Synthesis to polarization details
associated with small-scale magnetic fields, we isolate an option which was not
covered by the ideas of the Burn theory, i.e. using quantities averaged over
small-scale fluctuations of magnetic field and electron density. We describe
the contribution of small-scale fields in terms of Faraday dispersion and beam
depolarization. We consider the complex polarization for RM Synthesis without
any averaging over small-scale fluctuations of magnetic field and electron
density and demonstrate that it allows us to isolate the contribution from
small-scale field.

Relativistic Jet Dynamics and Calorimetry of Gamma-Ray Bursts","
Abstract: We present numerical solutions of the 2D relativistic hydrodynamics equations
describing the deceleration and expansion of highly relativistic conical jets,
of opening angles 0.05<theta<0.2, propagating into a medium of uniform density.
Jet evolution is followed from a collimated relativistic outflow through to the
quasi-spherical non-relativistic phase. We show that relativistic sideways
expansion becomes significant beyond the radius R at which the expansion
Lorentz factor drops to 1/theta. This is consistent with simple analytic
estimates, which predict faster sideways expansion than has been claimed based
on earlier numerical modeling. For t>R/c the emission of radiation from the jet
blast wave is similar to that of a spherical blast wave carrying the same
energy. Thus, the total (calorimetric) energy of GRB blast waves may be
estimated with only a small fractional error based on t>R/c observations.

"Title:
On the pulse--width statistics in radio pulsars. I. Importance of the  interpulse emission","
Abstract: We performed Monte Carlo simulations of different properties of pulsar radio
emission, such as: pulsar periods, pulse-widths, inclination angles and rates
of occurrence of interpulse emission (IP). We used recently available large
data sets of the pulsar periods P, the pulse profile widths W and the magnetic
inclination angle alpha. We also compiled the largest ever database of pulsars
with interpulse emission, divided into the double-pole (DP-IP) and the
single-pole (SP-IP) cases. Their distribution on the P - Pdot diagram strongly
suggests a secular alignment of the magnetic axis from the originally random
orientation. We derived possible parent distribution functions of important
pulsar parameters by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov significance test using
the available data sets (P, W, alpha and IP), different models of pulsar radio
beam rho = rho(P) as well as different trial distribution functions of pulsar
period and the inclination angles. The best suited parent period distribution
function is the log-normal distribution, although the gamma function
distribution cannot be excluded. The strongest constraint on derived model
distribution functions was the requirement that the numbers of interpulses were
exactly (within 1sigma errors) at the observed level of occurrences. We found
that a suitable model distribution function for the inclination angle is the
complicated trigonometric function which has two local maxima, one near 0 deg
and the other near 90 deg. The former and the latter implies the right rates of
IP occurrence. It is very unlikely that the pulsar beam deviates significantly
from the circular cross-section. We found that the upper limit for the average
beaming factor fb describing a fraction of the full sphere (called also beaming
fraction) covered by a pulsar beam is about 10%. This implies that the number
of the neutron stars in the Galaxy might be underestimated.

"Title:
Dispersion and thermal effects on electromagnetic instabilities in the  precursor of relativistic shocks","
Abstract: Fermi acceleration can develop efficiently at relativistic collisionless
shock waves provided the upstream (unshocked) plasma is weakly magnetized. At
low magnetization, the large size of the shock precursor indeed provides enough
time for electromagnetic micro-instabilities to grow and such
micro-instabilities generate small scale turbulence that in turn provides the
scattering required. The present paper extends our previous analysis on the
development of these micro-instabilities to account for the finite angular
dispersion of the beam of reflected and accelerated particles and to account
for the expected heating of the upstream electrons in the shock precursor. We
show that the oblique two stream instability may operate down to values of the
shock Lorentz factor gamma_{sh}~10 as long as the electrons of the upstream
plasma remain cold, while the filamentation instability is strongly inhibited
in this limit; however, as electrons get heated to relativistic temperatures,
the situation becomes opposite and the two stream instability becomes inhibited
while the filamentation mode becomes efficient, even at moderate values of the
shock Lorentz factor. The peak wavelength of these instabilities migrates from
the inertial electron scale towards the proton inertial scale as the background
electrons get progressively heated during the crossing of the shock precursor.
We also discuss the role of current driven instabilities upstream of the shock.
In particular, we show that the returning/accelerated particles give rise to a
transverse current through their rotation in the background magnetic field. We
find that the compensating current in the background plasma can lead to a
Buneman instability which provides an efficient source of electron heating.

"Title:
Nonlinear electrodynamics and CMB polarization","
Abstract: Recently WMAP and BOOMERanG experiments have set stringent constraints on the
polarization angle of photons propagating in an expanding universe: $\Delta
\alpha = (-2.4 \pm 1.9)^\circ$. The polarization of the Cosmic Microwave
Background radiation (CMB) is reviewed in the context of nonlinear
electrodynamics (NLED). We compute the polarization angle of photons
propagating in a cosmological background with planar symmetry. For this
purpose, we use the Pagels-Tomboulis (PT) Lagrangian density describing NLED,
which has the form $L\sim (X/\Lambda^4)^{\delta - 1}\; X $, where $X=1/4
F_{\alpha\beta} F^{\alpha \beta}$, and $\delta$ the parameter featuring the
non-Maxwellian character of the PT nonlinear description of the electromagnetic
interaction. After looking at the polarization components in the plane
orthogonal to the ($x$)-direction of propagation of the CMB photons, the
polarization angle is defined in terms of the eccentricity of the universe, a
geometrical property whose evolution on cosmic time (from the last scattering
surface to the present) is constrained by the strength of magnetic fields over
extragalactic distances.

Cosmological simulations of the formation of the stellar haloes around  disc galaxies","
Abstract: We use the Galaxies-Intergalactic Medium Interaction Calculation (GIMIC)
suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of
stellar spheroids of Milky Way-mass disc galaxies. The simulations contain
accurate treatments of metal-dependent radiative cooling, star formation,
supernova feedback, and chemodynamics, and the large volumes that have been
simulated yield an unprecedentedly large sample of ~400 simulated L_* disc
galaxies. The simulated galaxies are surrounded by low-mass, low-surface
brightness stellar haloes that extend out to ~100 kpc and beyond. The diffuse
stellar distributions bear a remarkable resemblance to those observed around
the Milky Way, M31 and other nearby galaxies, in terms of mass density, surface
brightness, and metallicity profiles. We show that in situ star formation
typically dominates the stellar spheroids by mass at radii of r < 30 kpc,
whereas accretion of stars dominates at larger radii and this change in origin
induces a change in slope of the surface brightness and metallicity profiles,
which is also present in the observational data. The system-to-system scatter
in the in situ mass fractions of the spheroid, however, is large and spans over
a factor of 4. Consequently, there is a large degree of scatter in the shape
and normalisation of the spheroid density profile within r < 30 kpc (e.g., when
fit by a spherical powerlaw profile the indices range from -2.6 to -3.4). We
show that the in situ mass fraction of the spheroid is linked to the formation
epoch of the system. Dynamically older systems have, on average, larger
contributions from in situ star formation, although there is significant
system-to-system scatter in this relationship. Thus, in situ star formation
likely represents the solution to the longstanding failure of pure
accretion-based models to reproduce the observed properties of the inner
spheroid.

"Title:
High-energy strong interactions: from `hard' to `soft'","
Abstract: We discuss the qualitative features of the recent data on multiparticle
production observed at the LHC. The tolerable agreement with Monte Carlos based
on LO DGLAP evolution indicates that there is no qualitative difference between
`hard' and `soft' interactions; and that a perturbative QCD approach may be
extended into the soft domain. However, in order to describe the data, these
Monte Carlos need an additional infrared cutoff k_min with a value k_min ~ 2-3
GeV which is not small, and which increases with collider energy. Here we
explain the physical origin of the large k_min. Using an alternative model
which matches the `soft' high-energy hadron interactions smoothly on to
perturbative QCD at small x, we demonstrate that this effective cutoff k_min is
actually due to the strong absorption of low k_t partons. The model embodies
the main features of the BFKL approach, including the diffusion in transverse
momenta, lnk_t, and an intercept consistent with resummed next-to-leading log
corrections. Moreover, the model uses a two-channel eikonal framework, and
includes the contributions from the multi-Pomeron exchange diagrams, both
non-enhanced and enhanced. The values of a small number of physically-motivated
parameters are chosen to reproduce the available total, elastic and proton
dissociation cross section (pre-LHC) data. Predictions are made for the LHC,
and the relevance to ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is briefly discussed. The
low x inclusive integrated gluon PDF, and the diffractive gluon PDF, are
calculated in this framework, using the parameters which describe the
high-energy pp and p\bar{p} `soft' data. Comparison with the PDFs obtained from
the global parton analyses of deep inelastic and related `hard' scattering
data, and from diffractive deep inelastic data looks encouraging.

Abstract: We have carried out a survey for 12CO J=1-0 and J=2-1 emission in the 260
early-type galaxies of the volume-limited Atlas3D sample, with the goal of
connecting their star formation and assembly histories to their cold gas
content. This is the largest volume-limited CO survey of its kind and is the
first to include many Virgo Cluster members. Sample members are dynamically hot
galaxies with a median stellar mass 3\times 10^{10} Msun; they are selected by
morphology rather than colour, and the bulk of them lie on the red sequence.
The overall CO detection rate is 56/259 = 0.22 \error 0.03, with no dependence
on K luminosity and only a modest dependence on dynamical mass. There are a
dozen CO detections among the Virgo Cluster members; statistical analysis of
their H_2 mass distributions and their dynamical status within the cluster
shows that the cluster's influence on their molecular masses is subtle at best,
even though (unlike spirals) they seem to be virialized within the cluster. We
suggest that the cluster members have retained their molecular gas through
several Gyr residences in the cluster. There are also a few extremely CO-rich
early-type galaxies with H_2 masses >= 10^9 Msun, and these are in low density
environments. We do find a significant trend between molecular content and the
stellar specific angular momentum. The galaxies of low angular momentum also
have low CO detection rates, suggesting that their formation processes were
more effective at destroying molecular gas or preventing its re-accretion. We
speculate on the implications of these data for the formation of various
sub-classes of early-type galaxies.

relations are those with saturated X-ray emission and that those stars also
present saturation in the H$\alpha$ line. Using several age spectral
indicators, we show that they are younger stars than those following the
general relationships. The non-universality of flux-flux relationships found in

On hadronic beam models for quasars and microquasars","
Abstract: Most of the hadronic jet models for quasars (QSOs) and microquasars (MQs)
found in literature represent beams of particles (e.g. protons). These
particles interact with the matter in the stellar wind of the companion star in
the system or with crossing clouds, generating gamma-rays via proton-proton
processes. Our aim is to derive the particle distribution in the jet as seen by
the observer, so that proper computation of the $\gamma$-ray and neutrino
yields can be done. We use relativistic invariants to obtain the transformed
expressions in the case of a power-law and power-law with a cutoff particle
distribution in the beam. We compare with previous expressions used earlier in
the literature. We show that formerly used expressions for the particle
distributions in the beam as seen by the observer are in error, differences
being strongly dependent on the viewing angle. For example, for $\Gamma =10$
($\Gamma$ is the Lorentz factor of the blob) and angles larger than $\sim
20^o$, the earlier-used calculation entails an over-prediction (order of
magnitude or more) of the proton spectra for $E>\Gamma mc^2$, whereas it always
over-predicts (two orders of magnitude) the proton spectrum at lower energies,
disregarding the viewing angle. All the results for photon and neutrino fluxes
in hadronic models in beams that have made use of the earlier calculation are
affected. Given that correct gamma-ray fluxes will be in almost any case
significantly diminished in comparison with published results, and that the
time of observations in Cherenkov facilities grows with the square of the
flux-reduction factor in a statistically limited result, the possibility of
observing hadronic beams is undermined.

primarily selected in far-IR and mostly constituted of massive, actively star
forming galaxies. There is some evidence for a dust attenuation law slightly
steeper than that used for starburst galaxies but we are unable to constrain
the presence or not of a bump at 220 nm. We confirm that a time dependent dust
attenuation is necessary to perform the best fits. Various calibrations of the
dust attenuation in the UV as a function of UV-optical colours are discussed. A
calibration of the current star formation rate combining UV and total IR
emissions is proposed with an accurate estimation of dust heating by old stars:

elements, but rather as a continuous, slow, smooth, warm upflow and turbulent,
entropy deficient, fast down drafts. This convective topology also results in
mixing on a scale as that of the classic mixing length formulation, and is
simply a consequence of mass conservation on flows in a stratified atmosphere.

K+A Galaxies as the Aftermath of Gas-Rich Mergers: Simulating the  Evolution of Galaxies as Seen by Spectroscopic Surveys","
Abstract: Models of poststarburst (or ""K+A"") galaxies are constructed by combining
fully three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers with
radiative transfer calculations of dust attenuation. Spectral line catalogs are
generated automatically from moderate-resolution optical spectra calculated as
a function of merger progress in each of a large suite of simulations. The
mass, gas fraction, orbital parameters, and mass ratio of the merging galaxies
are varied systematically, showing that the lifetime and properties of the K+A
phase are strong functions of merger scenario. K+A durations are generally less
than ~0.1-0.3 Gyr, significantly shorter than the commonly assumed 1 Gyr, which
is obtained only in rare cases, owing to a wide variation in star formation
histories resulting from different orbital and progenitor configurations.
Combined with empirical merger rates, the model lifetimes predict
rapidly-rising K+A fractions as a function of redshift that are consistent with
results of large spectroscopic surveys, resolving tension between the observed
K+A abundance and that predicted when one assumes the K+A duration is the
lifetime of A stars (~1 Gyr). The effects of dust attenuation, viewing angle,
and aperture bias on our models are analyzed. In some cases, the K+A features
are longer-lived and more pronounced when AGN feedback removes dust from the
center, uncovering the young stars formed during the burst. In this picture,
the K+A phase begins during or shortly after the bright starburst/AGN phase in
violent mergers, and thus offers a unique opportunity to study the effects of
quasar and star formation feedback on the gas reservoir and evolution of the
remnant. Analytic fitting formulae are provided for the estimates of K+A

A critical analysis of the UV-continuum slopes of high-redshift  galaxies; no evidence (yet) for extreme stellar populations at z > 6","
Abstract: It has recently been reported that the faintest galaxies at z~6-7 display
extremely blue UV continuum slopes, with a UV power-law index beta ~ -3. Such
slopes are bluer than previously reported for any other galaxy population, and
imply extinction-free, young, very low-metallicity stellar populations with a
high ionizing photon escape fraction. Here we undertake a critical study of the
evidence for such extreme values of beta, combining three new WFC3/IR-selected
samples of galaxies spanning ~2 decades in UV luminosity over the redshift
range z~4.5-8. We explore the impact of inclusion/exclusion of less robust
high-z candidates, and use the varying depths of the samples to explore the
effects of noise and selection bias. Simple data-consistency arguments suggest
that artificially blue average values of beta can result when the analysis is
extended into the deepest ~ 0.5-mag bin of these WFC3/IR-selected samples,
regardless of the actual luminosity or z range probed. By confining attention
to robust, well-detected high-z galaxy candidates, we find that the average
value of beta is consistent with -2.05 +/- 0.10 for z=5-7, and -22 < M_UV <
-18. We create and analyse a set of simulations which demonstrate that a bias
towards artifically low/blue average values of beta is indeed expected when the
UV slope analysis is extended towards the source detection threshold, and
conclude that there is as yet no clear evidence for UV slopes significantly
bluer than beta ~ -2, the typical value displayed by the bluest star-forming
galaxies at more modest z. A robust measurement of beta for the faintest
galaxies at z~7-8 remains a key observational goal, as it provides a
fundamental test for high escape fractions from a potentially abundant source
of reionizing photons. This goal is achievable with HST, but requires still
deeper WFC3/IR imaging in the HUDF.

An air shower array for LOFAR: LORA","
Abstract: LOFAR is a new form of radio telescope which can detect radio emission from
air showers induced by very high-energy cosmic rays. It can also look for radio
emission from particle cascades on the Moon induced by ultra high-energy cosmic
rays or neutrinos. To complement the radio detection, we are setting up a small
particle detector array LORA (LOfar Radboud Air shower array) within an area of
$\sim 300$ m diameter in the LOFAR core. It will help in triggering and
confirming the radio detection of air showers with the LOFAR antennas. In this
paper, we present a short overview about LORA and discuss its current status.

Halo Gas and Galaxy Disk Kinematics of a Volume-Limited Sample of MgII  Absorption-Selected Galaxies at z~0.1","
Abstract: We have directly compared MgII halo gas kinematics to the rotation velocities
derived from emission/absorption lines of the associated host galaxies. Our
0.096<z<0.148 volume-limited sample comprises 13 ~L* galaxies, with impact
parameters of 12-90 kpc from background quasars sight-lines, associated with 11
MgII absorption systems with MgII equivalent widths 0.3< W_r(2796)<2.3A. For
only 5/13 galaxies, the absorption resides to one side of the galaxy systemic
velocity and trends to align with one side of the galaxy rotation curve. The
remainder have absorption that spans both sides of the galaxy systemic
velocity. These results differ from those at z~0.5, where 74% of the galaxies
have absorption residing to one side of the galaxy systemic velocity. For all
the z~0.1 systems, simple extended disk-like rotation models fail to reproduce
the full MgII velocity spread, implying other dynamical processes contribute to
the MgII kinematics. In fact 55% of the galaxies are ""counter-rotating"" with
respect to the bulk of the MgII absorption. These MgII host-galaxies are
isolated, have low star formation rates (SFRs) in their central regions (<1
Msun/yr), and SFRs per unit area well below those measured for galaxies with
strong winds. The galaxy NaID (stellar+ISM) and MgIb (stellar) absorption line
ratios are consistent with a predominately stellar origin, implying
kinematically quiescent interstellar media. These facts suggest that the
kinematics of the MgII absorption halos for our sample of galaxies are not
influenced by galaxy--galaxy environmental effects, nor by winds intrinsic to
the host galaxies. For these low redshift galaxies, we favor a scenario in
which infalling gas accretion provides a gas reservoir for low-to-moderate star
formation rates and disk/halo processes.

"Title:
WIMPless Dark Matter from Non-Abelian Hidden Sectors with  Anomaly-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking","
Abstract: In anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models, superpartner masses
are proportional to couplings squared. Their hidden sectors therefore naturally
contain WIMPless dark matter, particles whose thermal relic abundance is
guaranteed to be of the correct size, even though they are not
weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs). We study viable dark matter
candidates in WIMPless AMSB models with non-Abelian hidden sectors and
highlight unusual possibilities that emerge in even the simplest models. In one
example with a pure SU(N) hidden sector, stable hidden gluinos freeze out with
the correct relic density, but have an extremely low, but natural, confinement
scale, providing a framework for self-interacting dark matter. In another
simple scenario, hidden gluinos freeze out and decay to visible Winos with the
correct relic density, and hidden glueballs may either be stable, providing a
natural framework for mixed cold-hot dark matter, or may decay, yielding
astrophysical signals. Last, we present a model with light hidden pions that
may be tested with improved constraints on the number of non-relativistic
degrees of freedom. All of these scenarios are defined by a small number of
parameters, are consistent with gauge coupling unification, preserve the
beautiful connection between the weak scale and the observed dark matter relic
density, and are natural, with relatively light visible superpartners. We
conclude with comments on interesting future directions.

"Title:
Radio observations of massive stars","
Abstract: Detectable radio emission occurs during almost all phases of massive star
evolution. I will concentrate on the thermal and non-thermal continuum emission
from early-type stars. The thermal radio emission is due to free-free
interactions in the ionized stellar wind material. Early ideas that this would
lead to an easy and straightforward way of measuring the mass-loss rates were
thwarted by the presence of clumping in the stellar wind. Multi-wavelength
observations provide important constraints on this clumping, but do not allow
its full determination. Non-thermal radio emission is associated with binarity.
This conclusion was already known for some time for Wolf-Rayet stars and in
recent years it has become clear that it is also true for O-type stars. In a
massive-star binary, the two stellar winds collide and around the shocks a
fraction of the electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds. Spiralling in
the magnetic field these electrons emit synchrotron radiation, which we detect
as non-thermal radio emission. The many parameters that influence the resulting
non-thermal radio fluxes make the modelling of these systems particularly
challenging, but their study will provide interesting new insight into massive
stars.

larger than the variation caused by the effects of neutrino oscillations. The

Twelve and a Half Years of Observations of Centaurus A with RXTE","
Abstract: The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer has observed the nearest radio galaxy,
Centaurus A, in 13 intervals from 1966 August to 2009 February over the 3--200
keV band. Spectra accumulated over the 13 intervals were well described with an
absorbed power law and iron line. Cut-off power laws and Compton reflection
from cold matter did not provide a better description. For the 2009 January
observation, we set a lower limit on the cut-off energy at over 2 MeV. The
power spectral density function was generated from RXTE/ASM and PCA data, as
well as an XMM-Newton long look, and clear evidence for a break at 18+10-7 days
(68% conf.) was seen. Given Cen A's high black hole mass and very low value of
Lx/LEdd, the break was a factor of 17+/-9 times higher than the break frequency
predicted by the McHardy and co-workers' relation, which was empirically
derived for a sample of objects, which are radio-quiet and accreting at
relatively high values of Lbol/LEdd. We have interpreted our observations in
the context of a clumpy molecular torus. The variability characteristics and
the broadband spectral energy distribution, when compared to Seyferts, imply
that the bright hard X-ray continuum emission may originate at the base of the
jet, yet from behind the absorbing line of sight material, in contrast to what
is commonly observed from blazars.

Towards a complete census of high-z ULIRGs with Herschel","
Abstract: Using Herschel PACS and SPIRE observations as part of the HerMES, we explore
the far-IR properties of a sample of mid-IR selected starburst dominated
ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z ~ 2. We derive robust estimates
of infrared luminosities (L_IR) and dust temperatures (Td) of the population
and find that galaxies in our sample range from those that are as cold as
high-z sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) to those that are as warm as optically
faint radio galaxies (OFRGs) and local ULIRGs. We also demonstrate that a
significant fraction of our sample would be missed from ground based (sub)mm
surveys (850-1200{\mu}m) showing that the latter introduce a bias towards the
detection of colder sources. Similarly, based on PACS data as part of the PEP
project, we construct for the first time the full average SED of a sub-sample
of infrared luminous Lyman break galaxies at z ~ 3, and find them to have
higher T_d when compared to that of SMGs with comparable L_IR. We conclude that
high-z ULIRGs span a wide range of dust temperatures, larger than that seen in
local ULIRGs, and that Herschel data provide the means to characterize the bulk
of the ULIRG population, free from selection biases introduced by ground based

"Title:
The ATLAS3D project - II. Morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies","
Abstract: [Abridged] We use the ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs) to
study the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, Psi, defined as the angle
between the photometric and kinematic major axis. We find that 71% of nearby
ETGs are strictly aligned systems (Psi > 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 < Psi
< 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have Psi < 15 deg. Taking into account measurement
uncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,
suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are not
consistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. We identify
morphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),
blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). We use kinemetry
to analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types of
regular and non-regular rotators. We find 82% of regular rotators and 17%
non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due to
data quality. The non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions and
are massive. The majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetric
features, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinct
cores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).
Most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and are
non-regular rotators. While the trends are weak, there is a tendency that large
values of Psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities and
among the most massive galaxies in the sample. We suggest that the most common
formation mechanism for ETGs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.
Less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with much
lower net angular momentum.

A molecular cloud within the light echo of V838 Monocerotis","
Abstract: Context. V838 Mon is an eruptive variable, which exploded in 2002. It
displayed the most spectacular light echo ever observed. However, neither the
origin of the reflecting matter nor the nature of the 2002 outburst have been
firmly constrained. Aims. We investigate the nature of the CO radio emission
detected in the field of the light echo. In particular, we explore its
connection to the echoing dust around V838 Mon. Methods. We observed the echo
region in multiple CO rotational transitions. We present and analyse maps of
the region obtained in the 12CO(1-0) and (3-2) lines. In addition, deep spectra
at several positions were acquired in 12CO(1-0), (2-1), (3-2), and 13CO(1-0),
(2-1). Radiative transfer modelling of line intensities is performed for chosen
positions to constrain the kinetic temperatures and densities. We derive global
parameters (e.g. mass, distance, total column density) of the emitting cloud.
Results. We found that a compact molecular cloud is located within the echo
region. The molecular emission is physically connected to the dusty environment
seen in the optical echo and they both belong to the same translucent cloud.
The interstellar nature of the cloud is confirmed by its high mass of 90-150
Msun. We propose that the cloud consists of material remaining after the
formation of the cluster to which V838 Mon belongs. This indicates that the
eruptive star has young age (3-10 Myr).

its innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), then, when it plunges into a second

Development and Performance of the PHOT (Portable High-Speed Occultation  Telescope) Systems","
Abstract: The PHOT (Portable High-Speed Occultation Telescope) systems were developed
for the specific purpose of observing stellar occultations by solar system
objects. Stellar occultations have unique observing constraints: they may only
be observable from certain parts of the globe; they often require a rapid
observing cadence; and they require accurate timestamp information for each
exposure. The PHOT systems consist of 14"" telescopes, CCD cameras, camera
mounting plates, GPS-based time standards, and data acquisition computers. The
PHOT systems are similar in principle to the POETS systems (Portable
Occultation, Eclipse and Transit Systems, described by Souza et al. 2006 and
reported on by Gulbis et al. 2008), with the main differences being (a)
different CCD/Cameras with slightly different specifications and (b) a
stand-alone custom-built time standard used by PHOT, whereas POETS uses a
commercial time-standard that is controlled from a computer. Since 2005, PHOT
systems have been deployed on over two dozen occasions to sites in the US,
Mexico, Chile, Namibia, South Africa, France, Austria, Switzerland, Australia
and New Zealand, mounted on portable 14"" telescopes or on larger stationary
telescopes. Occultation light curves acquired from the 3.9-m AAT
(Anglo-Australian Telescope) have produced photometric signal-to-noise ratios

(telescopes, cameras, timers and data stations) and present SNR estimates for
actual and predicted occultations as functions of star brightness, telescope
aperture and frame rate.

remarkably effective in describing certain strong-field, fast-motion systems,
including binary pulsars containing dense neutron stars and binary black hole
systems inspiraling toward a final merger. The reasons for this effectiveness
are largely unknown. When carried to high orders in the post-Newtonian

Neutrino Fluxes from NUHM LSP Annihilations in the Sun","
Abstract: We extend our previous studies of the neutrino fluxes expected from
neutralino LSP annihilations inside the Sun to include variants of the minimal
supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) with squark, slepton and
gaugino masses constrained to be universal at the GUT scale, but allowing one
or two non-universal supersymmetry-breaking parameters contributing to the
Higgs masses (NUHM1,2). As in the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) with universal Higgs
masses, there are large regions of the NUHM parameter space where the LSP
density inside the Sun is not in equilibrium, so that the annihilation rate may
be far below the capture rate, and there are also large regions where the
capture rate is not dominated by spin-dependent LSP-proton scattering. The
spectra possible in the NUHM are qualitatively similar to those in the CMSSM.
We calculate neutrino-induced muon fluxes above a threshold energy of 10 GeV,
appropriate for the IceCube/DeepCore detector, for points where the NUHM yields
the correct cosmological relic density for representative choices of the NUHM
parameters. We find that the IceCube/DeepCore detector can probe regions of the
NUHM parameter space in addition to analogues of the focus-point strip and the
tip of the coannihilation strip familiar from the CMSSM. These include regions
with enhanced Higgsino-gaugino mixing in the LSP composition, that occurs where
neutralino mass eigenstates cross over. On the other hand, rapid-annihilation
funnel regions in general yield neutrino fluxes that are unobservably small.

The effects of primordial non-Gaussianity on giant-arc statistics","
Abstract: For over a decade, it has been debated whether the concordance LCDM model is
consistent with the observed abundance of giant arcs in clusters. While
previous theoretical studies have focused on properties of the lens and source
populations, as well as cosmological effects such as dark energy, the impact of
initial conditions on the giant-arc abundance is relatively unexplored. Here,
we quantify the impact of non-Gaussian initial conditions with the local
bispectrum shape on the predicted frequency of giant arcs. Using a
path-integral formulation of the excursion set formalism, we extend a
semi-analytic model for calculating halo concentrations to the case of
primordial non-Gaussianity, which may be useful for applications outside of
this work. We find that massive halos tend to collapse earlier in models with
positive f_NL, relative to the Gaussian case, leading to enhanced concentration
parameters. The converse is true for f_NL < 0. In addition to these effects,
which change the lensing cross sections, non-Gaussianity also modifies the
abundance of supercritical clusters available for lensing. These combined
effects work together to either enhance (f_NL > 0) or suppress (f_NL < 0) the
probability of giant-arc formation. Using the best value and 95% confidence
levels currently available from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, we
find that the giant-arc optical depth for sources at z_s~2 is enhanced by ~20%
and ~45% for f_NL = 32 and 74 respectively. In contrast, we calculate a
suppression of ~5% for f_NL = -10. These differences translate to similar
relative changes in the predicted all-sky number of giant arcs.

iXon camera, a nearly 60 arcsec square field of view with high quantum
efficiency, low read noise, low dark current, and full-frame readout rates
ranging from as slow as desired to a maximum of between 3.5 Hz and 35 Hz
(depending on the mode; read noise of 6e-/pixel and 49 e-/pixel with
electron-multiplying gain=1, respectively). User-selectable binning and
subframing can increase the cadence to a few hundred Hz. An
electron-multiplying mode can be employed for photon counting, effectively
reducing the read noise to sub-electron levels at the expense of dynamic range.
Data cubes, or individual frames, can be triggered to several nanosecond
accuracy using the Global Positioning System. MORIS is mounted on the

Rotational Variability of Earth's Polar Regions: Implications for  Detecting Snowball Planets","
Abstract: We have obtained the first time-resolved, disc-integrated observations of
Earth's poles with the Deep Impact spacecraft as part of the EPOXI Mission of
Opportunity. These data mimic what we will see when we point next-generation
space telescopes at nearby exoplanets. We use principal component analysis
(PCA) and rotational lightcurve inversion to characterize color inhomogeneities
and map their spatial distribution from these unusual vantage points, as a
complement to the equatorial views presented in Cowan et al. (2009). We also
perform the same PCA on a suite of simulated rotational multi-band lightcurves
from NASA's Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3D spectral Earth model. This
numerical experiment allows us to understand what sorts of surface features PCA
can robustly identify. We find that the EPOXI polar observations have similar
broadband colors as the equatorial Earth, but with 20-30% greater apparent
albedo. This is because the polar observations are most sensitive to
mid-latitudes, which tend to be more cloudy than the equatorial latitudes
emphasized by the original EPOXI Earth observations. The cloudiness of the
mid-latitudes also manifests itself in the form of increased variability at
short wavelengths in the polar observations, and as a dominant gray eigencolor
in the south polar observation. We construct a simple reflectance model for a
snowball Earth. By construction, our model has a higher Bond albedo than the
modern Earth; its surface albedo is so high that Rayleigh scattering does not
noticeably affect its spectrum. The rotational color variations occur at short
wavelengths due to the large contrast between glacier ice and bare land in
those wavebands. Thus we find that both the broadband colors and diurnal color
variations of such a planet would be easily distinguishable from the modern-day
Earth, regardless of viewing angle.

discovered a faint companion to the white dwarf WD 0806-661. The comoving
source has a projected separation of 130"", corresponding to 2500 AU at the

absolute magnitude at 4.5um is ~1 mag fainter than the faintest known T dwarfs,
making it a strong candidate for the coolest known brown dwarf. The combination
of M_4.5 and the age of the primary (1.5 Gyr) implies an effective temperature
of ~300 K and a mass of ~7 M_Jup according to theoretical evolutionary models.
The white dwarf's progenitor likely had a mass of ~2 M_sun, and thus could have
been born with a circumstellar disk that was sufficiently massive to produce a
companion with this mass. Therefore, the companion could be either a brown
dwarf that formed like a binary star or a giant planet that was born within a

nuclear recoils and can be used to search for dark matter interactions. In
principle CUORE, thanks to its mass, could look for an annual modulation of the
counting rate at low energies. We developed a trigger and a pulse shape
identification algorithm, that allow to lower the energy threshold down to the
few keV region. We present the preliminary results obtained on an array made of
four CUORE-like crystals, and the prospects for a dark matter search in CUORE.

"Title:
Concurrent X-ray, near-infrared, sub-millimeter, and GeV gamma-ray  observations of Sgr A*","
Abstract: The radiative counterpart of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic
center (GC), Sgr A*, is subject to frequent flares visible simultaneously in
X-rays and near-infrared (NIR). Often, enhanced radio variability from
centimeter to sub-millimeter wavelengths is observed to follow these X-ray/NIR
eruptions. We present here a multi-wavelength campaign carried out in April
2009, with the aim of characterizing this broadband flaring activity.
Concurrent data from the XMM-Newton/EPIC (2-10 keV), VLT/NACO (2.1 microns, 3.8
microns), APEX/LABOCA (870 microns), and Fermi/LAT (0.1-200 GeV) instruments
are employed to derive light curves and spectral energy distributions of new
flares from Sgr A*. We detected two relatively bright NIR flares both
associated with weak X-ray activity, one of which was followed by a strong
sub-mm outburst 200 min later. Photometric spectral information on a NIR flare
was obtained for the first time with NACO giving a power-law photon index
alpha=-0.4\pm0.3. The first attempt to detect flaring activity from the Fermi
GC source 1FGL J1745.6-2900 is also reported. NIR, X-ray, and sub-mm flares are
finally modeled in the context of non-thermal emission processes. It is found
that the simplest scenario involving a single expanding plasmoid releasing
synchrotron NIR/sub-mm and synchrotron self-Compton X-ray radiation is
inadequate to reproduce the data, but suggestions to reconcile the basic
elements of the theory and the observations are proposed.

"Title:
A third HI 21-cm absorption system in the sight-line of MG J0414+0534: A  redshift for Object X?","
Abstract: We report the detection of a third HI 21-cm absorber in the sight-line
towards the z=2.64 quasar MG J0414+0534 (4C +05.19). In addition to the
absorption at the host redshift and in the z=0.96 gravitational lens, we find,
through a decimetre-wave spectral scan towards this source, strong absorption
at z=0.38. We believe this may be associated with ""Object X"", an additional
feature apparent in the field of the lensing galaxy and lensed images, on the
basis of its close proximity to the quasar images and the possible detection of
the [OIII] doublet in a published optical spectrum. If real, the strength of
the [OIII] emission would suggest the presence of an active galactic nucleus,
or a gas-rich galaxy undergoing rapid star formation, either of which is
consistent with the strong outflows apparent in the 21-cm spectrum. Although
this is the strongest intervening 21-cm absorber yet found, simultaneous
observations failed to detect any of the 18-cm OH lines at the 21-cm redshift.
This suggests that, as for the lensing galaxy, this is not the primary location
of the intervening material responsible for the very red colour of MG
J0414+0534.

"Title:
Solar total irradiance in cycle 23","
Abstract: The apparently unusual behaviour of the TSI during the most recent minimum of
solar activity has been interpreted as evidence against solar surface magnetism
as the main driver of the secular change in the TSI. We test claims that the
evolution of the solar surface magnetic field does not reproduce the observed
TSI in cycle 23. We use sensitive, 60-minute averaged MDI magnetograms and
quasi-simultaneous continuum images as an input to our SATIRE-S model and
calculate the TSI variation over cycle 23, sampled roughly twice-monthly. The
computed TSI is then compared to the PMOD composite of TSI measurements and to
the data from two individual instruments, SORCE/TIM and UARS/ACRIM II, that
monitored the TSI during the declining phase of cycle 23 and over the previous
minimum in 1996, respectively. Excellent agreement is found between the trends
shown by the model and almost all sets of measurements. The only exception is
the early, i.e. 1996 to 1998, PMOD data. Whereas the agreement between the
model and the PMOD composite over the period 1999-2009 is almost perfect, the
modelled TSI shows a steeper increase between 1996 and 1999 than implied by the
PMOD composite. On the other hand, the steeper trend in the model agrees
remarkably well with the ACRIM II data. A closer look at the VIRGO data, that
make the basis of the PMOD composite after 1996, reveals that only one of the
two VIRGO instruments, the PMO6V, shows the shallower trend present in the
composite, whereas the DIARAD measurements indicate a steeper trend. We
conclude that (1) the sensitivity changes of the PMO6V radiometers within VIRGO
during the first two years have very likely not been correctly evaluated, and
that (2) the TSI variations over cycle 23 and the change in the TSI levels
between the minima in 1996 and 2008 are consistent with the solar surface
magnetism mechanism.

Ancient giants: on the farthest galaxy at z=8.6","
Abstract: The observational frontiers for the detection of high-redshift galaxies have
recently been pushed to unimaginable distances with the record-holding Lyman
Alpha Emitter (LAE) UDFy-38135539 discovered at redshift z=8.6. However, the
physical nature and the implications of this discovery have yet to be assessed.
By selecting galaxies with observed luminosities similar to UDFy-38135539 in
state-of-the-art cosmological simulations tuned to reproduce the large scale
properties of LAEs, we bracket the physical nature of UDFy-38135539: it has a
star formation rate ~ 2.7-3.7 solar masses/yr, it contains ~ 10^{8.3-8.7} solar
mass of stars 50-80 Myr old, with stellar metallicity ~ 0.03-0.12 of the solar
value. For any of the simulated galaxies to be visible as a LAE in the observed
range, the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction at z=8.6 must be <= 0.2 and
extra ionizing radiation from sources clustered around UDFy-38135539 is
necessary. Finally, we predict that there is a 70% (15%) probability of
detecting at least 1 such source from JWST (HST/WFC3) observations in a
physical radius ~ 0.4 Mpc around UDFy-38135539.

"Title:
Spread of Matter over a Neutron-Star Surface During Disk Accretion:  Deceleration of Rapid Rotation","
Abstract: The problem of disk accretion onto the surface of a neutron star with a weak
magnetic field at a luminosity exceeding several percent of Eddington is
reduced to the problem of the braking of a hypersonic flow with a velocity that
is 0.4-0.5 of the speed of light above the base of the spreading layer -- a
dense atmosphere made up of previously fallen matter. We show that turbulent
braking in the Prandtl-Karman model with universally accepted coefficients for
terrestrial conditions and laboratory experiments and a ladder of interacting
gravity waves in a stratified quasi-exponential atmosphere at standard
Richardson numbers lead to a spin-up of the massive zone that extends to the
ocean made up of a plasma with degenerate electrons. Turbulent braking in the
ocean at the boundary with the outer solid crust reduces the rotation velocity
to the solid-body rotation velocity of the star. This situation should lead to
strong heating of deep atmospheric layers and to the switch-off of the
explosive helium burning mechanism. Obviously, a more efficient mechanism for
the dissipation of a fast azimuthal flow in the atmosphere should operate in
X-ray bursters. We show that a giant solitary gravity wave in the atmosphere
can lead to energy dissipation and to a sharp decrease in azimuthal velocity in
fairly rarefied atmospheric layers above the zone of explosive helium burning
nuclear reactions. We discuss the reasons why this wave, that has no direct
analog in the Earth's atmosphere or ocean, appears and its stability. We pose
the question as to whether neutron stars with massive atmospheres, spun up to
high velocities by accreting matter from a disk, can exist among the observed
Galactic X-ray sources.

"Title:
The debris disk host star HD 61005: a member of the Argus Association?","
Abstract: HD 61005 is a nearby young solar type star that shows a large infrared excess
due to a debris disk. The disk has been recently imaged from ground and space,
with indications of several components. Some characteristics of the disk
suggest the presence of planetary companions around the star, that remain
undetected in deep adaptive optics imaging. For a better understanding of the
system we aim to refine the determination of the stellar parameters, with
emphasis on the stellar age and system orientation. We used ASAS and Hipparcos
photometry and FEROS spectra to determine the rotation period, radial and
rotational velocity, chromospheric emission, effective temperature, and
chemical composition. We find no indication of any misalignment between the
star rotation axis and the disk. The standard age calibrations applied to
several indicators yield an age close to that of the Pleiades (120 Myr);
however the kinematic properties strongly support its membership in the younger
(40 Myr) Argus association, which also includes the IC 2391 open cluster.
Detailed comparison of the properties of HD 61005 and IC 2391 members shows
that the characteristics of HD 61005 are compatible with membership to the
Argus association, once its rather slow rotation is taken into account, because
lithium and other age indicators are somewhat correlated with stellar rotation
at a fixed age. We also identify systematic differences between the field and
cluster population of the Argus association, which are probably selection
effects, so we suggest that additional members with slower rotation and lower
activity level are waiting to be identified.

On the methanol masers in G9.62+0.20E and G188.95+0.89","
Abstract: A comparison between the observed light curves of periodic masers in
G9.62+0.20E and G188.95+0.89 and the results of a simple colliding-wind binary
model is made to establish whether the flaring and other time-dependent
behaviour of the masers in these two star forming regions can be ascribed to
changes in the environment of the masers or in the continuum emission from
parts of the background \ion{H}{2} region. It is found that the light curves of
widely different shape and amplitude in these two objects can be explained
within the framework of a periodic pulse of ionizing radiation that raises the
electron density in a volume of partially ionized gas against which the masers
are projected. It is also shown that the decay of the 11.405 $\kmps$ maser in
G188.95+0.89 can be explained very well in terms of the recombination of the
ionized gas against which the maser is projected while it would require very
special conditions to explain it in terms of changes in environment of the
maser. We conclude that for G9.62+0.20E and G188.95+0.89 the observed changes
in the masers are most likely due to changes in the background free-free
emission which is amplified by the masers.

Cosmic-ray driven dynamo in galaxies","
Abstract: We present recent developments of global galactic-scale numerical models of
the Cosmic Ray (CR) driven dynamo, which was originally proposed by Parker
(1992). We conduct a series of direct CR+MHD numerical simulations of the
dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM), composed of gas, magnetic fields and
CR components. We take into account CRs accelerated in randomly distributed
supernova (SN) remnants, and assume that SNe deposit small-scale, randomly
oriented, dipolar magnetic fields into the ISM. The amplification timescale of
the large-scale magnetic field resulting from the CR-driven dynamo is
comparable to the galactic rotation period. The process efficiently converts
small-scale magnetic fields of SN-remnants into galactic-scale magnetic fields.
The resulting magnetic field structure resembles the X-shaped magnetic fields
observed in edge-on galaxies.

direct measurement of the size or even surface mapping with a resolution down

X-ray mass proxies from hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters  (paper I)","
Abstract: We present a detailed study of scaling relations between total cluster mass
and three mass proxies based on X-ray observables: temperature of the
intra-cluster medium, gas mass and the product of the two, Y_X. Our analysis is
based on two sets of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations performed with
the TreePM-SPH GADGET code. The first set includes about 140 clusters with
masses above 5x10^13 M_sun/h (30 having mass above 10^15 M_sun/h), that have
been simulated with (i) non-radiative physics and including (ii) cooling, star
formation, chemical enrichment and the effect of supernova feedback triggering
galactic ejecta. This large statistics is used to quantify the robustness of
the scaling relations, to determine their redshift evolution and to calibrate
their intrinsic scatter and its distribution. We use a smaller set of clusters
including 18 halos with masses above 5x10^13 M_sun/h to test the robustness of
mass proxies against changing the physical processes included in simulations
(thermal conduction, artificial viscosity, cooling and star formation, galactic
winds and AGN feedback). We find the M-Y_X scaling relation to be the least
sensitive one to variations of the ICM physics, with its slope and redshift
evolution close to the self-similar model predictions. The distribution of the
scatter around the best-fitting relations is close to a log-normal one. M_gas
has the smallest scatter in mass, with values of sigma_lnM = 0.04-0.06,
depending on the physics included in the simulation, and with a mild dependence
on redshift. The M-T relation is the one with the largest scatter, with
sigma_lnM > 0.1 at z=0, increasing to > 0.15 at z=1. The intrinsic scatter in
the M-Y_X relation is slightly larger than in the M-M_gas relation. These
results confirm that both Y_X and M_gas mass proxies are well suited for
cosmological applications of future large X-ray surveys. [abridged]

varied during the INTEGRAL observations. This points to a change in the
temperature of the Comptonising medium from a minimum value of kT = 30-50 keV
to values larger than 100-150 keV. There is no significant detection of Compton
reflection, with a 3 sigma upper limit of R < 0.2, and no line has been

Li-rich K giants among 2000 low mass (M <= 3 Msun) giants spanning the
luminosity range from below to above the luminosity of the clump. Fifteen new
Li-rich giants including four super Li-rich K giants (A(Li) >= 3.2) were

giants at the luminosity of the clump or red horizontal branch. This new
finding is partly a consequence of the fact that our low-resolution survey is
the first large survey to include giants well below and above the RGB bump and
clump locations in the HR diagram. Origin of the lithium enrichment may be
plausibly attributed to the conversion of 3He via 7Be to 7Li by the
Cameron-Fowler mechanism but the location for onset of the conversion is
uncertain. Two possible opportunities to effect this conversion are discussed:
the bump in the first ascent of the red giant branch (RGB) and the He-core
flash at the tip of the RGB. The finite luminosity spread of the Li-rich giants
serves to reject the idea that Li enhancement is, in general, a consequence of
a giant swallowing a large planet.

Constraint on the quadrupole moment of super-massive black hole  candidates from the estimate of the mean radiative efficiency of AGN","
Abstract: The super-massive objects at the center of many galaxies are commonly thought
to be black holes. In 4-dimensional general relativity, a black hole is
completely specified by its mass $M$ and by its spin angular momentum $J$. All
the higher multipole moments of the gravitational field depend in a very
specific way on these two parameters. For instance, the mass quadrupole moment
is $Q = - J^2/M$. If we can estimate $M$, $J$, and $Q$ for the super-massive
objects in galactic nuclei, we over-constrain the theory and we can test the
black hole hypothesis. While there are many works studying how this can be done
with future observations, in this paper a constraint on the quadrupole moment
of these objects is obtained by using the current estimate of the mean
radiative efficiency of AGN. In terms of the anomalous quadrupole moment $q$,
the bound is $-2.01 < q < 0.14$.

Transit Variability in Bow Shock-Hosting Planets","
Abstract: We investigate the formation of bow shocks around exoplanets as a result of
the interaction of the planet with the coronal material of the host star,
focusing on physical causes that can lead to temporal variations in the shock
characteristics. We recently suggested that WASP-12b may host a bow shock
around its magnetosphere, similarly to the one observed around the Earth. For
WASP12b, the shock is detected in the near-UV transit light curve.
Observational follow-up suggests that the near-UV light curve presents temporal
variations, which may indicate that the stand-off distance between the shock
and the planet is varying. This implies that the size of the planet's
magnetosphere is adjusting itself in response to variations in the surrounding
ambient medium. We investigate possible causes of shock variations for the
known eccentric (e>0.3) transiting planets. We show that, because the distance
from the star changes along the orbit of an eccentric planet, the shock
characteristics are modulated by orbital phase. We predict time offsets between
the beginnings of the near-UV and optical light curves that are, in general,
less than the transit duration. Variations in shock characteristics caused in
eccentric systems can only be probed if the shock is observed at different
orbital phases, which is, in general, not the case for transit observations.
However, non-thermal radio emission produced by the interaction of the star and
planet should be modulated by orbital phase. We also quantify the response of
the shock to variations in the coronal material itself due to, e.g., a
non-axisymmetric stellar corona, planetary obliquity, intrinsic variations of
the stellar magnetic field. Such variations do not depend on the system
eccentricity. We conclude that, for systems where a shock is detectable through
transit light curve observations, shock variations should be a common
occurrence. (Abridged)

(space-space-velocity) analysis of the molecular and atomic cloud tracers
through the region and despite its wide velocity range (\emph{FWHM}$\sim22.3
\kms$ around $\vlsr\sim 95.9 \kms$), we identified W43 as a large (equivalent
diameter $\sim 140$ pc) and coherent complex of molecular clouds which is
surrounded by an atomic gas envelope (equivalent diameter $\sim 290$ pc). We
measured the total mass of this newly-identified molecular complex ($M_{{\tiny
total}}\sim 7.1 \times 10^6 \msun$), the mass contained in dense $870 \micron$
clumps ($<5$ pc dense cloud structures, $M_{{\tiny clumps}}\sim 8.4 \times 10^5
\msun$) and conclude that W43 is particularly massive and concentrated. The
distance we assume for the W43 complex is 6 kpc from the Sun, which may place
it at the meeting point of the Scutum-Centaurus (or Scutum-Crux) Galactic arm
and the Bar, a dynamically complex region where high-velocity streams could
easily collide. The star formation rate of W43 is suggested not to be steady
but it is increasing from $\, \sim 0.01 \msun\, {yr}^{-1}$ (measured from its
$8\,\mu$m luminosity) to $\sim 0.1 \msun\, {yr}^{-1}$ (measured from its

Nicmos Polarimetry of ""Polar Scattered"" Seyfert 1 Galaxies","
Abstract: The nuclei of Seyfert 1 galaxies exhibit a range of optical polarization
characteristics that can be understood in terms of two scattering regions
producing orthogonal polarizations: an extended polar scattering region (PSR)
and a compact equatorial scattering region (ESR), located within the
circum-nuclear torus. Here we present NICMOS 2.0 micron imaging polarimetry of
6 ""polar scattered"" Seyfert 1 (S1) galaxies, in which the PSR dominates the
optical polarization. The unresolved nucleus (<0.58 arcsec) is significantly
polarized in only three objects, but 5 of the 6 exhibit polarization in a 0.58
to 1.5 arcsec circum-nuclear annulus. In Fairall 51 and ESO 323-G077, the
polarization position angle at 2 microns (theta2m) is consistent with the
average for the optical spectrum (thetav), implying that the nuclear
polarization is dominated by polar scattering at both wavelengths. The same is
probably true for NGC 3227. In both NGC 4593 and Mrk 766, there is a large
difference between theta2m and thetav off nucleus, where polar scattering is
expected to dominate. This may be due to contamination by interstellar
polarization in NGC 4593, but there is no clear explanation in the case of the
strongly polarized Mrk 766. Lastly, in Mrk 1239, a large change (~ 60deg) in
theta2m between the nucleus and the annulus indicates that the unresolved
nucleus and its immediate surroundings have different polarization states at 2
microns, which we attribute to the ESR and PSR, respectively. A further
implication is that the source of the scattered 2 micron emission in the
unresolved nucleus is the accretion disk, rather than torus hot dust emission.

VLTI observations of the dust geometry around R Coronae Borealis stars","
Abstract: We are investigating the formation and evolution of dust around the
hydrogen-deficient supergiants known as R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars. We aim
to determine the connection between the probable merger past of these stars and
their current dust-production activities. We carried out high-angular
resolution interferometric observations of three RCB stars, namely RY Sgr, V
CrA, and V854 Cen with the mid-IR interferometer, MIDI on the VLTI, using two
telescope pairs. The baselines ranged from 30 to 60 m, allowing us to probe the
dusty environment at very small spatial scales (~ 50 mas or 400 stellar radii).
The observations of the RCB star dust environments were interpreted using both
geometrical models and one-dimensional radiative transfer codes. From our
analysis we find that asymmetric circumstellar material is apparent in RY Sgr,
may also exist in V CrA, and is possible for V854 Cen. Overall, we find that
our observations are consistent with dust forming in clumps ejected randomly
around the RCB star so that over time they create a spherically symmetric
distribution of dust. However, we conclude that the determination of whether
there is a preferred plane of dust ejection must wait until a time series of
observations are obtained.

The Axiverse Extended: Vacuum Destabilisation, Early Dark Energy and  Cosmological Collapse","
Abstract: A model is presented in the philosophy of the ""String Axiverse"" of Arvanitaki
et al (arXiv:0905.4720v2 [hep-th]) that incorporates a coupling of ultralight
axions to their corresponding moduli through the mass term. The light fields
roll in their potentials at late times and contribute to the dark sector energy
densities in the cosmological expansion. The addition of a coupling and extra
field greatly enrich the possible phenomenology of the axiverse. There are a
number of interesting phases where the axion and modulus components behave as
Dark Matter or Dark Energy and can have considerable and distinct effects on
the expansion history of the universe by modifying the equation of state in the
past or causing possible future collapse of the universe. In future such a
coupling may help to alleviate fine tuning problems for cosmological axions. We
motivate and present the model, and briefly explore its cosmological
consequences numerically.

Multilevel Analysis of Oscillation Motions in Active Regions of the Sun","
Abstract: We present a new method that combines the results of an oscillation study
made in optical and radio observations. The optical spectral measurements in
photospheric and chromospheric lines of the line-of-sight velocity were carried
out at the Sayan Solar Observatory. The radio maps of the Sun were obtained
with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph at 1.76 cm. Radio sources associated with the
sunspots were analyzed to study the oscillation processes in the
chromosphere-corona transition region in the layer with magnetic field B=2000
G. A high level of instability of the oscillations in the optical and radio

similarities of the spectra of oscillations obtained by the two methods were
detected in the three-minute oscillations inside the sunspot umbra for the
dates when the active regions were situated near the center of the solar disk.
A comparison of the wavelet spectra for optical and radio observations showed a
time delay of about 50 seconds of the radio results with respect to optical
ones. This implies a MHD wave traveling upward inside the umbral magnetic tube
of the sunspot. Besides three-minute and five-minute ones, oscillations with
longer periods (8 and 15 minutes) were detected in optical and radio records.

The $k$-essence scalar field in the context of Supernova Ia Observations","
Abstract: A $k$-essence scalar field model having (non canonical) Lagrangian of the
form $L=-V(\phi)F(X)$ where $X=1/2g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\mu}\phi\nabla_{\nu}\phi$
with constant $V(\phi)$ is shown to be consistent with luminosity
distance-redshift data observed for type Ia Supernova. For constant $V(\phi)$,
$F(X)$ satisfies a scaling relation which is used to set up a differential
equation involving the Hubble parameter $H$, the scale factor $a$ and the
$k$-essence field $\phi$. $H$ and $a$ are extracted from SNe Ia data and using
the differential equation the time dependence of the field $\phi$ is found to
be: $\phi(t) \sim \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 t^2$. The constants
$\lambda_i$ have been determined. The time dependence is similar to that of the
quintessence scalar field (having canonical kinetic energy) responsible for
homogeneous inflation. Furthermore, the scaling relation and the obtained time
dependence of the field $\phi$ is used to determine the $X$-dependence of the
function $F(X)$.

A New Method for Band-limited Imaging with Undersampled Detectors","
Abstract: Since its original use on the Hubble Deep Field, ""Drizzle"" has become a de
facto standard for the combination of images taken by the Hubble Space Tele-
scope. However, the drizzle algorithm was developed with small, faint,
partially resolved sources in mind, and is not the best possible algorithm for
high signal-to-noise unresolved objects. Here, a new method for creating
band-limited images from undersampled data is presented. The method uses a
drizzled image as a first order approximation and then rapidly converges toward
a band-limited image which fits the data given the statistical weighting
provided by the drizzled image. The method, named iDrizzle, for iterative
Drizzle, effectively eliminates both the small high-frequency artifacts and
convolution with an interpolant kernel that can be introduced by drizzling. The
method works well in the presence of geometric distortion, and can easily
handle cosmic rays, bad pixels, or other missing data. It can combine images
taken with random dithers, though the number of dithers required to obtain a
good final image depends in part on the quality of the dither placements.
iDrizzle may prove most beneficial for producing high-fidelity point spread
functions from undersampled images, and could be particularly valuable for
future Dark Energy missions such as WFIRST and EUCLID, which will likely
attempt to do high precision supernova photometry and lensing experiments with
undersampled detectors.

"Title:
Radio Remnants of Compact Binary Mergers - the Electromagnetic Signal  that will follow the Gravitational Waves","
Abstract: The question ""what is the observable electromagnetic (EM) signature of a
compact binary merger?"" is an intriguing one with crucial consequences to the
quest for gravitational waves (GW). Compact binary mergers are prime sources of
GW, targeted by current and next generation detectors. Numerical simulations
have demonstrated that these mergers eject energetic sub-relativistic (or even
relativistic) outflows. This is certainly the case if the mergers produce short
GRBs, but even if not, significant outflows are expected. The interaction of
such outflows with the surround matter inevitably leads to a long lasting radio
signal. We calculate the expected signal from these outflows (our calculations
are also applicable to short GRB orphan afterglows) and we discuss their
detectability. We show that the optimal search for such signal should,
conveniently, take place around 1.4 GHz. Realistic estimates of the outflow
parameters yield signals of a few hundred $\mu$Jy, lasting a few weeks, from
sources at the detection horizon of advanced GW detectors. Followup radio
observations, triggered by GW detection, could reveal the radio remnant even
under unfavorable conditions. Upcoming all sky surveys can detect a few dozen,
and possibly even thousands, merger remnants at any give time, thereby
providing robust merger rate estimates even before the advanced GW detectors
become operational. In fact, the radio transient RT 19870422 fits well the
overall properties predicted by our model and we suggest that its most probable
origin is a compact binary merger radio remnant.

Using M Dwarf Spectra to Map Extinction in the Local Galaxy","
Abstract: We use spectra of more than 56,000 M dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

technique compares spectra from the stars in the SDSS Data Release 7 M dwarf
sample in low-extinction lines of sight, as determined by Schlegel, Finkbeiner,

which have used a two-color method to determine extinction, we fit extinction
curves to fluxes across the entire spectral range from 5700 to 9200 {\AA} for
every star in our sample. Our result is an extinction map that extends from a
few tens of pc to approximately 2 kpc away from the sun. We also use a similar
technique to create a map of R_V values within approximately 1 kpc of the sun,

The Central Region of the Nearby Seyfert 2 Galaxy NGC 4945 : A Pair of  Spirals","
Abstract: NGC 4945 is a Seyfert 2 galaxy at a distance of 3.82 Mpc. Its relative
proximity has permitted a detailed SMA study of the circumnuclear molecular gas
in a galaxy exhibiting an AGN. Based on an analysis of the high-resolution
velocity field of the central region (20"" X 20"", 1"" = 19 pc), we demonstrate
that the S-shaped structure of the isovelocity contours is well reproduced by
the numerical results of a two dimensional hydrodynamical simulation. In
particular, the velocity structure is represented by the bending produced by a
shock along the spiral density waves, which are excited at the outer-inner
Lindblad resonance by a fast rotating bar. The simulated density map reveals a
pair of tightly wound spirals in the center which pass through most of the
ring-like (claimed to be a circumnuclear starburst ring by other authors) high
intensity region in the observations as well as intersect several Pa$\alpha$
emission line knots located outside the ring-like region. The calculated mass
inflow rate at a scale of 50 pc is about three times the inferred mass
accretion rate of the AGN of NGC 4945. We find that self-gravity of the gas is
important and should be included in our model for NGC 4945. The model is
compared with the gas orbit model discussed in Lim et al. (2009), and it is
shown that the hydrodynamic model provides a better match to the observed
position-velocity diagram and, hence, provides a more reliable prediction of
the outer inner Lindblad resonance position.

Considering two possible irradiation scenarios that could have occurred in the

Broad Ly alpha Emission from Three Nearby BL Lacertae Objects","
Abstract: We present far-UV HST/COS spectra of four nearby BL Lac Objects. BL Lac
spectra are dominated by a smooth, power-law continuum which arises in a
relativistic jet. However, the spectra are not necessarily featureless; weak,
broad- and/or narrow-line emission is sometimes seen in high-quality optical
spectra. We present detections of Lya emission in HST/COS spectra of Mrk421
(z=0.030) and PKS2005-489 (z=0.071) as well as an archival HST/GHRS observation
of Mrk501 (z=0.0337). Archival HST/STIS observations of PKS2155-304 (z=0.116)
show no Lya emission to a very low upper limit. Using the assumption that the
broad-line region (BLR) clouds are asymmetrically placed around the AGN, we use
these measured Lya emission features to constrain either the relativistic Gamma
values for the ionizing continuum produced by the jet (in the
ionization-bounded case) or the mass of warm gas (in the density-bounded case).
While realistic Gamma values can be obtained for all four cases, the values for
Mrk421 and PKS2155-304 are high enough to suggest that covering factors of
broad-line-region clouds of ~1-2% might be required to provide consistency with
earlier values of Doppler boosting and viewing angles suggested for this class
of BL Lacs. This discrepancy also exists in the case of M87, where the amount
of Doppler boosting in our direction is expected to be minimal, again
suggestive of a small covering factor of broad-line-region clouds. If, as these
small covering factors might suggest, the assumptions of a density-bounded
model could be more correct, then the observed Lya luminosities require that
BL\,Lac/FRI nuclei possess very little warm gas (10^-4 to 10^-5 Msun) as
suggested by Guilbert, Fabian & McCray (1983). If these clouds are in pressure
balance with a hotter (~10^6 K) gas, the BLR contains too little mass to power
the AGN by accretion alone.

Properties of the nuclear medium","
Abstract: We review our knowledge on the properties of the nuclear medium that have
been studied, along many years, on the basis of many-body theory, laboratory
experiments and astrophysical observations. First we consider the realm of
phenomenological laboratory data and astrophysical observations, and the hints
they can give on the characteristics that the nuclear medium should possess.
The analysis is based on phenomenological models, that however have a strong
basis on physical intuition and an impressive success. More microscopic models
are also considered, and it is shown that they are able to give invaluable
information on the nuclear medium, in particular on its Equation of State. The
interplay between laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations are
particularly stressed, and it is shown how their complementarity enriches
enormously our insights into the structure of the nuclear medium. We then
introduce the nucleon-nucleon interaction and the microscopic many-body theory
of nuclear matter, with a critical discussion about the different approaches
and their results. The Landau Fermi Liquid theory is introduced and briefly
discussed. As illustrative example, we discuss neutron matter at very low
density, and it is shown how it can be treated within the many-body theory. A
section is dedicated to the pairing problem. The connection with nuclear
structure is then discussed, on the basis of the Energy Density Functional
method. The possibility to link the physics of exotic nuclei and the
astrophysics of neutron stars is particularly stressed. Finally we discuss the
thermal properties of the nuclear medium, in particular the liquid-gas phase
transition and its connection with the phenomenology on heavy ion reactions and
the cooling evolution of neutron stars. The presentation has been taken for
non-specialists and possibly for non-nuclear physicists.

the cluster systemic velocity with no clear kinematical connection to any of

Studying cosmic reionization with observations of the global 21-cm  signal","
Abstract: We explore the ability of observations of the global brightness temperature
of the 21-cm signal to constrain the reionization history and the properties of
the ionizing sources. In order to describe the reionization signal, we employ
either a commonly-used toy model or a structure formation model that
parameterizes the properties of the ionizing sources. If the structure
formation model captures the actual evolution of the reionization signal, then
detecting the signal is somewhat easier than it would be for the toy model;
using the toy model in this case also leads to systematic errors in
reconstructing the reionization history, though a sufficiently sensitive
experiment should be able to distinguish between the two models. We show that
under optimistic assumptions regarding systematic noise and foreground removal,
one-year observations of the global 21-cm spectrum should be able to detect a
wide range of realistic models and measure the main features of the
reionization history while constraining the key properties of the ionizing
sources.

stars, compact stars with a quark matter core and an hadronic outer layer, can
be as massive as 2 M_sun, but only for a significantly limited range of
parameters. We demonstrate that the appearance of quark matter in massive stars
depends crucially on the stiffness of the nuclear matter EoS. We show that the
masses of hybrid stars stay below the ones of hadronic and pure quark stars,
due to the softening of the EoS at the quark-hadron phase transition.

The Cosmic Core-collapse Supernova Rate does not match the Massive-Star  Formation Rate","
Abstract: We identify a ""supernova rate problem"": the measured cosmic core-collapse
supernova rate is a factor of ~ 2 smaller (with significance ~ 2 sigma) than
that predicted from the measured cosmic massive-star formation rate. The
comparison is critical for topics from galaxy evolution and enrichment to the
abundance of neutron stars and black holes. We systematically explore possible
resolutions. The accuracy and precision of the star formation rate data and
conversion to the supernova rate are well supported, and proposed changes would
have far-reaching consequences. The dominant effect is likely that many
supernovae are missed because they are either optically dim (low-luminosity) or
dark, whether intrinsically or due to obscuration. We investigate supernovae
too dim to have been discovered in cosmic surveys by a detailed study of all
supernova discoveries in the local volume. If possible supernova impostors are
included, then dim supernovae are common enough by fraction to solve the
supernova rate problem. If they are not included, then the rate of dark core
collapses is likely substantial. Other alternatives are that there are
surprising changes in our understanding of star formation or supernova rates,
including that supernovae form differently in small galaxies than in normal
galaxies. These possibilities can be distinguished by upcoming supernova
surveys, star formation measurements, searches for disappearing massive stars,

The CO-to-H2 Conversion Factor From Infrared Dust Emission Across the  Local Group","

in five Local Group galaxies that span approximately an order of magnitude in
metallicity - M31, M 33, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), NGC 6822, and the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We model the dust mass along the line of sight
from infrared (IR) emission and then solve for the alpha_CO that best allows a
single gas-to-dust ratio (delta_GDR) to describe each system. This approach
remains sensitive to CO-dark envelopes of H2 surrounding molecular clouds. In M
31, M 33, and the LMC we find alpha_CO \approx 3-9 M_sun pc^-2 (K km s^-1)^-1,
consistent with the Milky Way value within the uncertainties. The two lowest
metallicity galaxies in our sample, NGC 6822 and the SMC (12 + log(O/H) \approx
8.2 and 8.0), exhibit a much higher alpha_CO. Our best estimates are
\alpha_NGC6822 \approx 30 M_sun/pc^-2 (K km s^-1)^-1 and \alpha_SMC \approx 70
M_sun/pc^-2 (K km s-1)-1. These results are consistent with the conversion
factor becoming CO a strong function of metallicity around 12 + log(O/H) \sim
8.4 - 8.2. We favor an interpretation where decreased dust-shielding leads to
the dominance of CO-free envelopes around molecular clouds below this

The Influence of Deuteration and Turbulent Diffusion on the Observed D/H  Ratio","
Abstract: The influence of turbulent mixing on the chemistry of the interstellar medium
has so far received little attention. Previous studies of this effect have
suggested that it might play an important role in mixing the various phases of
the interstellar medium. In this paper we examine the potential effects of
turbulent diffusion on the deuterium chemistry within molecular clouds. We find
that such mixing acts to reduce the efficiency of deuteration in these clouds
by increasing the ionization fraction and reducing freeze-out of heavy
molecules. This leads to lower abundances for many deuterated species. We also
examine the influence of turbulent mixing on the transition from atomic
hydrogen to H2 and from atomic deuterium to HD near the cloud edge. We find
that including turbulent diffusion in our models serves to push these
transitions deeper into the cloud and helps maintain a higher atomic fraction
throughout the cloud envelope. Based on these findings, we propose a new
process to account for the significant scatter in the observed atomic D/H ratio
for galactic sightlines extending beyond the Local Bubble. Although several
mechanisms have been put forward to explain this scatter, they are unable to
fully account for the range in D/H values. We suggest a scenario in which
turbulent mixing of atomic and molecular gas at the edges of molecular clouds
causes the observed atomic D/H ratio to vary by a factor of ~2.

Clustering of obscured and unobscured quasars in the Bootes field:  Placing rapidly growing black holes in the cosmic web","
Abstract: We present the first measurement of the spatial clustering of mid-infrared
selected obscured and unobscured quasars, using a sample in the redshift range
0.7 < z < 1.8 selected from the 9 deg^2 Bootes multiwavelength survey. Recently
the Spitzer Space Telescope and X-ray observations have revealed large
populations of obscured quasars that have been inferred from models of the
X-ray background and supermassive black hole evolution. To date, little is
known about obscured quasar clustering, which allows us to measure the masses
of their host dark matter halos and explore their role in the cosmic evolution
of black holes and galaxies. In this study we use a sample of 806 mid-infrared
selected quasars and ~250,000 galaxies to calculate the projected quasar-galaxy
cross-correlation function w_p(R). The observed clustering yields
characteristic dark matter halo masses of log (M_halo [h^-1 M_sun]) =
12.7^+0.4_-0.6 and 13.3^+0.3_-0.4 for unobscured quasars (QSO-1s) and obscured
quasars (Obs-QSOs), respectively. The results for QSO-1s are in excellent
agreement with previous measurements for optically-selected quasars, while we
conclude that the Obs-QSOs are at least as strongly clustered as the QSO-1s. We
test for the effects of photometric redshift errors on the optically-faint
Obs-QSOs, and find that our method yields a robust lower limit on the
clustering; photo-z errors may cause us to underestimate the clustering
amplitude of the Obs-QSOs by at most ~20%. We compare our results to previous

massive, and have longer periods than those found around solar-type host stars.

"Title:
A binary merger origin for inflated hot Jupiter planets","
Abstract: We hypothesize that hot Jupiters with inflated sizes represent a separate
planet formation channel,the merging of two low-mass stars. We show that the
abundance and properties of W UMa stars and low mass detached binaries are
consistent with their being possible progenitors. The degree of inflation of
the transiting hot Jupiters correlates with their expected spiral-in life time
by tidal dissipation, and this could indicate youth if the stellar dissipation
parameter Q'* is sufficiently low. Several Jupiter-mass planets can form in the
massive compact disk formed in a merger event. Gravitational scattering between
them can explain the high incidence of excentric, inclined, and retrograde
orbits. If the population of inflated planets is indeed formed by a merger
process, their frequency should be much higher around blue stragglers than
around T Tauri stars.

The large-scale diffuse radio emission in A781","
Abstract: A781 belongs to a complex system characterized by extended X-ray emissions
that may form part of line of clusters of galaxies along a filament. The aim of
this work is to investigate the possible presence of extended, diffuse
synchrotron radio emission connected to the intra-cluster medium of A781. We
studied the radio continuum emission and the spectral index properties in
proximity of the A781 by analyzing archival Very Large Array observations at
1400 and 325 MHz. The main cluster of the system is permeated by diffuse
low-surface brightness radio emission which is classified, being located close
to the center, as a radio halo. The diffuse emission presents the typical
extension and radio power of the other halos known in the literature.
Interestingly, the radio halo appears to be linked to a peripheral patch
previously found in the literature. The spectrum of this peripheral emission
shows a radial steepening which may confirm that this source is indeed a
cluster relic.

Interference of Light in Michelson-Morley Interferometer: A Quantum  Optical Approach","
Abstract: We investigate how the temporal coherence interference properties of light in
a Michelson-Morley interferometer (MMI), using only a single-photon detector,
can be understood in a quantum-optics framework in a straightforward and
pedagogical manner. For this purpose we make use of elementary quantum field
theory and Glaubers theory for photon detection in order to calculate the
expected interference pattern in the MMI. If a thermal reference source is used
in the MMI local oscillator port in combination with a thermal source in the
signal port, the interference pattern revealed by such an intensity measurement
shows a distinctive dependence on the differences in the temperature of the two
sources. The MMI can therefore be used in order to perform temperature
measurements. A related method was actually used to carry out high precision
measurements of the cosmic micro-wave background radiation on board of the COBE
satellite. The theoretical framework allows us to consider any initial quantum
state. The interference of single photons as a tool to determine the angular
peak-frequency of a one-photon pulse interfering with a single-photon reference
pulse is, e.g., considered. A similar consideration for coherent laser pulses
leads to a different response in the detector. The MMI experimental setup is
therefore in a sense an example of an optical device where one can exhibit the
difference between classical and quantum-mechanical light using only intensity
measurements.

"Title:
A possible correlation between the high energy electron spectrum and the  cosmic-ray secondary-to-primary ratios","
Abstract: Recent observations of high energy cosmic-ray electrons by the Fermi-LAT and
the HESS experiments between $20$ GeV and $5$ TeV have found that the energy
spectrum closely follow a broken power-law with a break at around $1$ TeV. On
the other hand, measurements of cosmic-ray secondary-to-primary ratios like the
boron-to-carbon ratio seem to indicate a possible change in the slope at
energies around $100$ GeV/n. In this paper, we discuss one possible explanation
for the observed break in the electron spectrum and its possible correlation
with the flattening in the secondary-to-primary ratios at higher energies. In
our model, we assume that cosmic-rays after acceleration by supernova remnant
shock waves, escape downstream of the shock and remain confined within the
remnant until the shock slows down. During this time, the high-energy electrons
suffer from radiative energy losses and the cosmic-ray nuclei undergo nuclear
fragmentations due to their interactions with the matter. Once the cosmic-rays
are released from the supernova remnants, they follow diffusive propagation in
the Galaxy where they further suffer from radiative or fragmentation losses.

Spectral components in the bright, long GRB 061007: properties of the  photosphere and the nature of the outflow","
Abstract: We present a time-resolved spectral analysis of the bright, long GRB 061007

shape throughout the burst. This component provides a natural explanation for
the hardness-intensity correlation seen within the burst and also allows us to
estimate the bulk Lorentz factor and the radius of the photosphere. The
power-law component dominates the fit at high energies and has a nearly
constant slope of -1.5. We discuss the possibility that this component is of
the same origin as the high-energy power laws recently observed in some Fermi
LAT bursts.

"Title:
Gravitational Cherenkov losses in MOND theories","
Abstract: Survival of high-energy cosmic rays (HECRs) against gravitational Cherenkov
losses is shown not to cast strong constraints on MOND theories that are
compatible with general relativity (GR): theories that coincide with GR in the
high-acceleration limit. The energy-loss rate, L, is shown to be many orders
smaller than those derived in the literature for theories with no extra scale.
The gravitational acceleration produced by a HECR in its vicinity is much
higher than the MOND acceleration a0. So, modification to GR, which underlies
L, enters only beyond the MOND radius of the particle, within which GR holds
sway: r_M=sqrt(Gp/c a0). The spectral cutoff, which enters L quadratically, is
thus 1/r_M, not the particle's, much larger, de Broglie wavenumber: k_{dB}=
p/hbar. Thus, L is smaller than published rates, which use k_{dB}, by a factor
(r_M k_{dB})^2~10^{39}(cp/3.10^{11}Gev)^3. With 1/r_M as cutoff, the distance a
HECR can travel without major losses is q l_M, where l_M=c^2/a0 is the MOND
length, and q is a dimensionless function of parameters of the problem. Since
l_M is ~2 pi times the Hubble distance, survival of HECRs does not strongly
constrain GR-compatible, MOND theories. Such theories also easily satisfy
existing preferred-frame limits, inasmuch as these limits are gotten in
high-acceleration systems. I exemplify the results with MOND adaptations of
Einstein-Aether theories.

"Title:
The Near-IR Spectrum of Titan Modeled with an Improved Methane Line List","
Abstract: We have obtained spatially resolved spectra of Titan in the near-infrared J,
H and K bands at a resolving power of ~5000 using the near-infrared integral
field spectrometer (NIFS) on the Gemini North 8m telescope. Using recent data
from the Cassini/Huygens mission on the atmospheric composition and surface and
aerosol properties, we develop a multiple-scattering radiative transfer model
for the Titan atmosphere. The Titan spectrum at these wavelengths is dominated
by absorption due to methane with a series of strong absorption band systems
separated by window regions where the surface of Titan can be seen. We use a
line-by-line approach to derive the methane absorption coefficients. The
methane spectrum is only accurately represented in standard line lists down to
~2.1 {\mu}m. However, by making use of recent laboratory data and modeling of
the methane spectrum we are able to construct a new line list that can be used
down to 1.3 {\mu}m. The new line list allows us to generate spectra that are a
good match to the observations at all wavelengths longer than 1.3 {\mu}m and
allow us to model regions, such as the 1.55 {\mu}m window that could not be
studied usefully with previous line lists such as HITRAN 2008. We point out the
importance of the far-wing line shape of strong methane lines in determining
the shape of the methane windows. Line shapes with Lorentzian, and
sub-Lorentzian regions are needed to match the shape of the windows, but
different shape parameters are needed for the 1.55 {\mu}m and 2 {\mu}m windows.
After the methane lines are modelled our observations are sensitive to
additional absorptions, and we use the data in the 1.55 {\mu}m region to
determine a D/H ratio of 1.77 \pm 0.20 x 10-4, and a CO mixing ratio of 50 \pm
11 ppmv. In the 2 {\mu}m window we detect absorption features that can be
identified with the {\nu}5+3{\nu}6 and 2{\nu}3+2{\nu}6 bands of CH3D.

Time evolution and rotation of starspots on CoRoT-2 from the modelling  of transit photometry","
Abstract: CoRoT-2, the second planet-hosting star discovered by the CoRoT satellite, is
a young and active star. A total of 77 transits were observed for this system
over a period of 135 days. Small modulations detected in the optical light
curve of the planetary transits are used to study the position, size,
intensity, and temporal evolution of the photospheric spots on the surface of
the star that are occulted by the planetary disk. We apply a spot model to
these variations and create a spot map of the stellar surface of CoRoT-2 within
the transit band for every transit. From these maps, we estimate the stellar
rotation period and obtain the longitudes of the spots in a reference frame
rotating with the star. Moreover, the spots temporal evolution is determined.
This model achieves a spatial resolution of 2\circ. Mapping of 392 spots vs.
longitude indicates the presence of a region free of spots, close to the
equator, reminiscent of the coronal holes observed on the Sun during periods of
maximum activity. With this interpretation, the stellar rotation period within
the transit latitudes of -14.\circ 6 \pm 10 \circ is found to be 4.48 days.
This rotation period is shorter than the 4.54 days as derived from the
out-of-transit light modulation. Since the transit data samples a region close
to the stellar equator, while the period determined from out-of-transit data
reflects the average rotation of the star, this is taken as an indication of a
latitudinal differential rotation of about 3% or 0.042 rad/d.

Magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling at Jupiter-like exoplanets with  internal plasma sources: implications for detectability of auroral radio  emissions","
Abstract: In this paper we provide the first consideration of magnetosphere-ionosphere
coupling at Jupiter-like exoplanets with internal plasma sources such as
volcanic moons. We estimate the radio power emitted by such systems under the
condition of near-rigid corotation throughout the closed magnetosphere, in
order to examine the behaviour of the best candidates for detection with next
generation radio telescopes. We thus estimate for different stellar X-ray-UV
(XUV) luminosity cases the orbital distances within which the ionospheric
Pedersen conductance would be high enough to maintain near-rigid corotation,
and we then consider the magnitudes of the large-scale magnetosphere-ionosphere
currents flowing within the systems, and the resulting radio powers, at such
distances. We also examine the effects of two key system parameters, i.e. the
planetary angular velocity and the plasma mass outflow rate from sources
internal to the magnetosphere. In all XUV luminosity cases studied, a
significant number of parameter combinations within an order of magnitude of
the jovian values are capable of producing emissions observable beyond 1 pc, in
most cases requiring exoplanets orbiting at distances between ~1 and 50 AU, and
for the higher XUV luminosity cases these observable distances can reach beyond
~50 pc for massive, rapidly rotating planets. The implication of these results
is that the best candidates for detection of such internally-generated radio
emissions are rapidly rotating Jupiter-like exoplanets orbiting stars with high
XUV luminosity at orbital distances beyond ~1 AU, and searching for such
emissions may offer a new method of detection of more distant-orbiting
exoplanets.

On the nature of spectral line broadening in solar coronal dimmings","
Abstract: We analyze the profiles of iron emission lines observed in solar coronal
dimmings associated with coronal mass ejections, using the EUV Imaging
Spectrometer on board Hinode. We quantify line profile distortions with
empirical coefficients (asymmetry and peakedness) that compare the fitted
Gaussian to the data. We find that the apparent line broadenings reported in
previous studies are likely to be caused by inhomogeneities of flow velocities
along the line of sight, or at scales smaller than the resolution scale, or by
velocity fluctuations during the exposure time. The increase in the amplitude
of Alfv\'en waves cannot, alone, explain the observed features. A
double-Gaussian fit of the line profiles shows that, both for dimmings and
active region loops, one component is nearly at rest while the second component
presents a larger Doppler shift than that derived from a single-Gaussian fit.

Combining perturbation theories with halo models for the matter  bispectrum","
Abstract: We investigate how unified models should be built to be able to predict the
matter-density bispectrum (and power spectrum) from very large to small scales
and that are at the same time consistent with perturbation theory at low $k$
and with halo models at high $k$. We use a Lagrangian framework to decompose
the bispectrum into ""3-halo"", ""2-halo"", and ""1-halo"" contributions, related to
""perturbative"" and ""non-perturbative"" terms. We describe a simple
implementation of this approach and present a detailed comparison with
numerical simulations. We show that the 1-halo and 2-halo contributions contain
counterterms that ensure their decay at low $k$, as required by physical
constraints, and allow a better match to simulations. Contrary to the power
spectrum, the standard 1-loop perturbation theory can be used for the
perturbative 3-halo contribution because it does not grow too fast at high $k$.
Moreover, it is much simpler and more accurate than two resummation schemes
investigated in this paper. We obtain a good agreement with numerical
simulations on both large and small scales, but the transition scales are
poorly described by the simplest implementation. This cannot be amended by
simple modifications to the halo parameters, but we show how it can be
corrected for the power spectrum and the bispectrum through a simple
interpolation scheme that is restricted to this intermediate regime. Then, we
reach an accuracy on the order of 10% on mildly and highly nonlinear scales,
while an accuracy on the order of 1% is obtained on larger weakly nonlinear
scales. This also holds for the real-space two-point correlation function.

Abstract: Within the NUclei of GAlaxies project we have obtained IRAM PdBI and 30m
12CO(1-0) and 12CO(2-1) observations of the spiral galaxy NGC 6951. Previous
work shows that there is indirect evidence of gas inflow from 3 kpc down to
small radii: a large-scale stellar bar, a prominent starburst ring (r~580 pc)
and a LINER/Seyfert 2 nucleus. In this paper we study the gas kinematics as
traced by the CO line emission in detail. We quantify the influence of the
large-scale stellar bar by constructing an analytical model of the evolution of
gas particles in a barred potential. From this model gravitational torques and
mass accumulation rates are computed. We compare our model-based gravitational
torque results with previous observationally-based ones. The model also shows
that the large-scale stellar bar is indeed the dominant force for driving the
gas inward, to the starburst ring. Inside the ring itself a nuclear stellar
oval might play an important role. Detailed analysis of the CO gas kinematics
there shows that emission arises from two co-spatial, but kinematically
distinct components at several locations. The main emission component can
always be related to the overall bar-driven gas kinematics. The second
component exhibits velocities that are larger than expected for gas on stable
orbits, has a molecular gas mass of 1.8x10^6Msun, is very likely connected to
the nuclear stellar oval, and is consistent with inflowing motion towards the
very center. This may form the last link in the chain of gas inflow towards the
active galactic nucleus in NGC 6951.

Effects of quark matter nucleation on the evolution of proto-neutron  stars","
Abstract: (Abridged) A phase of strong interacting matter with deconfined quarks is
expected in the core of massive neutron stars. If this deconfinement phase
transition is of the first order then it will be triggered by the nucleation of
a critical size drop of the stable quark phase in the metastable hadronic
phase. Within these circumstances it has been shown that cold pure hadronic
compact stars above a threshold value of their gravitational mass are
metastable with respect to the ""decay"" to quark stars (compact stars made at
least in part of quark matter). This stellar conversion process liberates a
huge amount of energy, and it could be the energy source of some of the long
GRBs. The main goal of the present work is to establish whether a newborn
hadronic star (proto-hadronic star) could survive the early stages of its
evolution without ""decaying"" to a quark star. To this aim, we study the
nucleation process of quark matter in hot beta-stable hadronic matter, with and
without trapped neutrinos. We calculate and compare the nucleation rate and the
nucleation time due to thermal and quantum nucleation mechanisms. We compute
the crossover temperature above which thermal nucleation dominates the finite
temperature quantum nucleation mechanism. We next discuss the consequences of
quark matter nucleation for the physics and the evolution of proto-neutron
stars. We introduce the new concept of limiting conversion temperature and
critical mass M_cr for proto-hadronic stars, and we show that proto-hadronic
stars with a mass M < M_cr could survive the early stages of their evolution
without decaying to a quark star. We extend the concept of maximum mass of a
""neutron star"" with respect to the classical one introduced by Oppenheimer &
Volkoff to account for the existence of two distinct families of compact stars
(hadronic stars and quark stars) as predicted by the present scenario.

The Extended Main-Sequence Turn-off Clusters of the Large Magellanic  Cloud - Missing links in Globular Cluster Evolution","
Abstract: Recent observations of intermediate age (1 - 3 Gyr) massive star clusters in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have revealed that the majority possess
bifurcated or extended main-sequence turn-off (EMSTO) morphologies. This effect
can be understood to arise from subsequent star formation amongst the stellar
population with age differences between constituent stars amounting to 50 - 300
Myr. Age spreads of this order are similarly invoked to explain the light
element abundance variations witnessed in ancient globular clusters. In this
paper we explore the proposition that the clusters exhibiting the EMSTO
phenomenon are a general phase in the evolution of massive clusters, one that
naturally leads to the particular chemical properties of the ancient globular
cluster population.
We show that the isolation of EMSTO clusters to intermediate ages is the
consequence of observational selection effects. In our proposed scenario, the
EMSTO phenomenon is identical to that which establishes the light element
abundance variations that are ubiquitous in the ancient globular cluster
population. Our scenario makes a strong prediction: EMSTO clusters will exhibit
abundance variations in the light elements characteristic of the ancient GC
population.

Abstract: Doubly special relativity (DSR), with both an invariant velocity and an

positive $\lambda$, the grand partition function, the energy density, the
specific heat, the entropy, and the pressure are smaller than those of special
relativity (SR), while the velocity of photons and the ratio of pressure to
energy are larger. In contrast, with a negative $\lambda$, the quantum gravity
effects show up in the opposite direction. However, these effects only manifest
themselves significantly when the temperature is larger than $10^{-3} E_{\rm
P}$. Thus, DSR can have considerable influence on the early universe in

variations of small-scale magnetic activity during the solar cycle.

"Title:
Scalar perturbations in conformal rolling scenario with intermediate  stage","
Abstract: Scalar cosmological perturbations with nearly flat power spectrum may
originate from perturbations of the phase of a scalar field conformally coupled
to gravity and rolling down negative quartic potential. We consider a version
of this scenario whose specific property is a long intermediate stage between
the end of conformal rolling and horizon exit of the phase perturbations. Such
a stage is natural, e.g., in cosmologies with ekpyrosis or genesis. Its
existence results in small negative scalar tilt, statistical anisotropy of all
even multipoles starting from quardupole of general structure (in contrast to
the usually discussed single quadrupole of special type) and non-Gaussianity of
a peculiar form.

"Title:
On different types of instabilities in black hole accretion discs.  Implications for X-ray binaries and AGN","
Abstract: We discuss two important instability mechanisms that may lead to the
limit-cycle oscillations of the luminosity of the accretion disks around
compact objects: ionization instability and radiation-pressure instability.
Ionization instability is well established as a mechanism of X-ray novae
eruptions in black hole binary systems but its applicability to AGN is still
problematic. Radiation pressure theory has still very weak observational
background in any of these sources. In the present paper we attempt to confront
the parameter space of these instabilities with the observational data. At the
basis of this simple survey of sources properties we argue that the radiation
pressure instability is likely to be present in several Galactic sources with
the Eddington ratios above 0.15, and in AGN with the Eddington ratio above
0.025. Our results favor the parameterization of the viscosity through the
geometrical mean of the radiation and gas pressure both in Galactic sources and
AGN. More examples of the quasi-regular outbursts in the timescales of 100
seconds in Galactic sources, and hundreds of years in AGN are needed to
formulate firm conclusions. We also show that the disk sizes in the X-ray novae
are consistent with the ionization instability. This instability may also
considerably influence the lifetime cycle and overall complexity in the
supermassive black hole environment.

Hard X-ray Emission from the NGC 5044 Group","
Abstract: Observations made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) Proportional
Counter Array (PCA) to constrain the hard X-ray emission in the NGC 5044 group
are reported here. Modeling a combined PCA and ROSAT position sensitive
proportional counter (PSPC) spectrum with a 0.5 - 15 keV energy range shows
excess hard emission above 4 keV. Addition of a powerlaw component with
spectral index of 2.6 - 2.8 and luminosity of 2.6 x10^42 ergs/s within 700 kpc
in the observed energy band removes these residuals. Thus, there is a detection
of a significant non-thermal component that is 32% of the total X-ray emission.
Point source emission makes up at most 14% of the non-thermal emission from the
NGC 5044 group. Therefore, the diffuse, point source subtracted, non-thermal
component is 2.2 - 3.0x10^42 ergs/s . The cosmic-ray electron energy density is
3.6 x10^[-12] ergs cm-3 and the average magnetic field is 0.034 \muGauss in the
largest radio emitting region. The ratio of cosmic-ray electron energy density
to magnetic field energy density, ~2.5x10^4, is significantly out of
equipartition and is therefore atypical of radio lobes. In addition, the
group's small size and low non-thermal energy density strongly contradicts the
size-energy relationship found for radio lobes. Thus, it is unlikely to the
related to the active galaxy and is most likely a relic of the merger. The
energy in cosmic-rays and magnetic field is consistent with simulations of
cosmic-ray acceleration by merger shocks.

The Magellanic Quasars Survey. I. Doubling the Number of Known AGNs  Behind the Small Magellanic Cloud","
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic confirmation of 29 new, 12 plausible, and 3

the Anglo-Australian Telescope of 268 candidates selected primarily based on
their mid-IR colors, along with a smaller number of optically variable sources

partly expected from the high surface density of SMC as compared to the LMC

number of I<20 mag quasars in the field is ~38, and we found 15 (22 with
plausible) or 40% (60%). We did not attempt to determine the nature of the
remaining sources, although several appear to be new planetary nebulae. The
newly discovered AGNs can be used as reference points for future proper motion
studies, to study absorption in the interstellar medium, and to study the
physics of quasar variability with the existing long-term, highly cadenced OGLE

Colors of a Second Earth II: Effects of Clouds on Photometric  Characterization of Earth-like Exoplanets","
Abstract: As a test-bed for future investigations of directly imaged terrestrial
exoplanets, we present the recovery of the surface components of the Earth from
multi-band diurnal light curves obtained with the EPOXI spacecraft. We find
that the presence and longitudinal distribution of ocean, soil and vegetation
are reasonably well reproduced by fitting the observed color variations with a
simplified model composed of a priori known albedo spectra of ocean, soil,
vegetation, snow and clouds. The effect of atmosphere, including clouds, on
light scattered from surface components is modeled using a radiative transfer
code. The required noise levels for future observations of exoplanets are also
determined. Our model-dependent approach allows us to infer the presence of
major elements of the planet (in the case of the Earth, clouds and ocean) with
observations having S/N $\gtrsim 10$ in most cases and with high confidence if
S/N $\gtrsim 20$. In addition, S/N $\gtrsim 100$ enables us to detect the
presence of components other than ocean and clouds in a fairly
model-independent way. Degradation of our inversion procedure produced by cloud
cover is also quantified. While cloud cover significantly dilutes the magnitude
of color variations compared to the cloudless case, the pattern of color
changes remains. Therefore, the possibility of investigating surface features
through light curve fitting remains even for exoplanets with cloud cover
similar to the Earth's.

Atomic data for neutron-capture elements I. Photoionization and  recombination properties of low-charge selenium ions","
Abstract: We present multi-configuration Breit-Pauli AUTOSTRUCTURE calculations of
distorted-wave photoionization (PI) cross sections, and total and partial
final-state resolved radiative recombination (RR) and dielectronic
recombination (DR) rate coefficients for the first six ions of the trans-iron
element Se. These calculations were motivated by the recent detection of Se
emission lines in a large number of planetary nebulae. Se is a potentially
useful tracer of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis, but accurate determinations
of its abundance in photoionized nebulae have been hindered by the lack of
atomic data governing its ionization balance. Our calculations were carried out
in intermediate coupling with semi-relativistic radial wavefunctions. PI and
recombination data were determined for levels within the ground configuration
of each ion, and experimental PI cross-section measurements were used to
benchmark our results. For DR, we allowed dn=0 core excitations, which are
important at photoionized plasma temperatures. DR is the dominant recombination
process for each of these Se ions at temperatures representative of
photoionized nebulae (~10^4 K). To estimate the uncertainties of these data, we
compared results from three different configuration-interaction expansions for
each ion, and tested the sensitivity of the results to the radial scaling
factors in the structure calculations. We find that the internal uncertainties
are typically 30-50% for the direct PI cross sections and ~10% for the computed
RR rate coefficients, while those for low-temperature DR can be considerably
larger (from 15-30% up to two orders of magnitude) due to the unknown energies
of near-threshold autoionization resonances. The results are suitable for
incorporation into photoionization codes used to numerically simulate
astrophysical nebulae, and will enable robust determinations of nebular Se
abundances.

Towards Matter Inflation in Heterotic String Theory","
Abstract: Recently, a class of inflation models in supergravity with gauge non-singlet
matter fields as the inflaton has been proposed. It is based on a `tribrid'
structure in the superpotential and on a Heisenberg symmetry for solving the
eta-problem. We suggest that a generalization of this model class may be
suitable for realising inflation in heterotic orbifold compactifications, where
the Heisenberg symmetry is a property of the tree-level K""ahler potential of
untwisted matter fields. We discuss moduli stabilization in this setup and
propose a mechanism to stabilize the modulus associated to the inflaton, which
respects the symmetry in the large radius limit. Inflation ends via a waterfall
phase transition, as in hybrid inflation. We give conditions which have to be
satisfied for realising inflation along these lines in the matter sector of
heterotic orbifolds.

Evolution of X-ray and FUV Disk-Dispersing Radiation Fields","
Abstract: We present new X-ray and Far Ultraviolet (FUV) observations of T Tauri stars
covering the age range 1 to 10 Myr. Our goals are to observationally constrain
the intensity of radiation fields responsible for evaporating gas from the
circumstellar disk and to assess the feasibility of current photoevaporation
models, focusing on X-ray and UV radiation. We greatly increase the number of
7-10 Myr old T Tauri stars observed in the X-rays by including observations of
the well populated 25 Ori aggregate in the Orion OB1a subassociation. With
these new 7-10 Myr objects, we confirm that X-ray emission remains constant
from 1-10 Myr. We also show, for the first time, observational evidence for the
evolution of FUV radiation fields with a sample of 56 accreting and
non-accreting young stars spanning 1 Myr to 1 Gyr. We find that the FUV
emission decreases on timescales consistent with the decline of accretion in
classical T Tauri stars until reaching the chromospheric level in weak T Tauri
stars and debris disks. Overall, we find that the observed strength of high
energy radiation is consistent with that required by photoevaporation models to
dissipate the disks in timescales of approximately 10 Myr. Finally, we find
that the high energy fields that affect gas evolution are not similarly
affecting dust evolution; in particular, we find that disks with inner
clearings, the transitional disks, have similar levels of FUV emission as full
disks.

Lyman Break Analogs: Constraints on the Formation of Extreme Starbursts  at Low and High Redshift","
Abstract: Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs), characterized by high far-UV luminosities and
surface brightnesses as detected by GALEX, are intensely star-forming galaxies
in the low-redshift universe ($z\sim 0.2$), with star formation rates reaching
up to 50 times that of the Milky Way. These objects present metallicities,
morphologies and other physical properties similar to higher redshift Lyman
Break Galaxies (LBGs), motivating the detailed study of LBAs as local
laboratories of this high-redshift galaxy population. We present results from
our recent integral-field spectroscopy survey of LBAs with Keck/OSIRIS, which
shows that these galaxies have the same nebular gas kinematic properties as
high-redshift LBGs. We argue that such kinematic studies alone are not an
appropriate diagnostic to rule out merger events as the trigger for the
observed starburst. Comparison between the kinematic analysis and morphological
indices from HST imaging illustrates the difficulties of properly identifying
(minor or major) merger events, with no clear correlation between the results
using either of the two methods. Artificial redshifting of our data indicates
that this problem becomes even worse at high redshift due to surface brightness
dimming and resolution loss. Whether mergers could generate the observed
kinematic properties is strongly dependent on gas fractions in these galaxies.
We present preliminary results of a CARMA survey for LBAs and discuss the
implications of the inferred molecular gas masses for formation models.

The Dynamics of Stellar Coronae Harboring Hot-jupiters II. A Space  Weather Event on A Hot-jupiter","
Abstract: We carry out a numerical simulation depicting the effects of a Coronal Mass
Ejection (CME) event on a close-in giant planet in an extrasolar system. We
drive the CME in a similar manner as in simulations of space weather events on
Earth. The simulation includes the planetary orbital motion, which leads to the
forming of a comet-like planetary magnetotail which is oriented almost
perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the CME. The combination of
this feature and the fact that the CME does not expand much by the time it
reaches the planet leads to a unique CME-magnetosphere interaction, where the
CME itself is highly affected by the presence of the planetary magnetosphere.
We find that the planet is well-shielded from CME penetration, even for a
relatively weak internal magnetic field. The planetary angular momentum loss
associated with such an event is negligible compared to the total planetary
angular momentum. We also find that the energy which is deposited in the
magnetosphere is much higher than in the case of the Earth, and our simulation
suggests there is a large-scale change in the orientation of the
magnetosphere-ionosphere current system during the CME event.

Variability of southern and northern periodicities of Saturn Kilometric  Radiation","
Abstract: Among the persistent questions raised by the existence of a rotational
modulation of the Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR), the origin of the
variability of the 10.8 hours SKR period at a 1% level over weeks to years
remains intriguing. While its short-term fluctuations (20-30 days) have been
related to the variations of the solar wind speed, its long-term fluctuations
(months to years) were proposed to be triggered by Enceladus mass-loading
and/or seasonal variations. This situation has become even more complicated
since the recent identification of two separated periods at 10.8h and 10.6h,
each varying with time, corresponding to SKR sources located in the southern
(S) and the northern (N) hemispheres, respectively. Here, six years of Cassini
continuous radio measurements are investigated, from 2004 (pre-equinox) to the
end of 2010 (post-equinox). From S and N SKR, radio periods and phase systems
are derived separately for each hemisphere and fluctuations of radio periods
are investigated at time scales of years to a few months. Then, the S phase is
used to demonstrate that the S SKR rotational modulation is consistent with an
intrinsically rotating phenomenon, in contrast with the early Voyager picture.

A constant characteristic mass for star forming galaxies since z~3  revealed by radio emission in the COSMOS field","
Abstract: We present results of our 1.4 GHz image stacking analysis of mass-selected
galaxies in the COSMOS field. From the resulting median radio continuum flux
density we have determined the evolution of the average star formation rate
(SFR) of galaxies as a function of stellar mass, unbiased from effects of dust
but also source confusion due to the 1.5"" angular resolution achieved by the
VLA. We find a power-law relation between specific SFR (SSFR) and stellar mass
for star forming galaxies out to z=3. While higher mass systems exhibit lower
SSFRs at any epoch, no differential, more rapid evolution of high mass galaxies
is evident at least out to z~1.5 where our conclusions are most robust.
Utilizing measured mass functions of star forming systems, the characteristic
stellar mass for galaxies contributing most to the comoving SFR density appears
not to evolve. These findings hence challenge 'downsizing' scenarios in which
star formation has gradually shifted towards lower mass systems with cosmic
time. Our analysis constitutes the to-date best determination of the cosmic
star formation history (CSFH) since z=3 and yields indirect evidence for a
rapid decline of the global mass density of molecular gas with time.

Contemporaneous Chandra HETG and Suzaku X-ray Observations of NGC 4051","
Abstract: We present the results of a deep 300 ks Chandra HETG observation of the
highly variable narrow-line Seyfert Type 1 galaxy NGC 4051. The HETG spectrum
reveals 28 significant soft X-ray ionised lines in either emission or
absorption; primarily originating from H-like and He-like K-shell transitions
of O, Ne, Mg and Si (including higher order lines and strong forbidden emission
lines from O VII and Ne IX) plus high ionisation L-shell transitions from Fe
XVII to Fe XXII and lower ionisation inner-shell lines (e.g. O VI). Modelling
the data with XSTAR requires four distinct ionisation zones for the gas, all
outflowing with velocities < 1000 km/s. A selection of the strongest
emission/absorption lines appear to be resolved with FWHM of ~600 km/s. We also
present the results from a quasi-simultaneous 350 ks Suzaku observation of NGC
4051 where the XIS spectrum reveals strong evidence for blueshifted absorption
lines at ~6.8 and ~7.1 keV, consistent with previous findings. Modelling with
XSTAR suggests that this is the signature of a highly ionised, high velocity
outflow (log \xi ~ 4.1; v ~ -0.02c) which potentially may have a significant
effect on the host galaxy environment via feedback. Finally, we also
simultaneously model the broad-band 2008 XIS+HXD Suzaku data with archival
Suzaku data from 2005 when the source was observed to have entered an extended
period of low flux in an attempt to analyse the cause of the long-term spectral
variability. We find that we can account for this by allowing for large
variations in the normalisation of the intrinsic power-law component which may
be interpreted as being due to significant changes in the covering fraction of
a Compton-thick partial-coverer obscuring the central continuum emission.

"Title:
The impact of ISM turbulence, clustered star formation and feedback on  galaxy mass assembly through cold flows and mergers","
Abstract: Two of the dominant channels for galaxy mass assembly are cold flows (cold
gas supplied via the filaments of the cosmic web) and mergers. How these
processes combine in a cosmological setting, at both low and high redshift, to
produce the whole zoo of galaxies we observe is largely unknown. Indeed there
is still much to understand about the detailed physics of each process in
isolation. While these formation channels have been studied using
hydrodynamical simulations, here we study their impact on gas properties and
star formation (SF) with some of the first simulations that capture the
multiphase, cloudy nature of the interstellar medium (ISM), by virtue of their
high spatial resolution (and corresponding low temperature threshold). In this
regime, we examine the competition between cold flows and a
supernovae(SNe)-driven outflow in a very high-redshift galaxy (z {\approx} 9)
and study the evolution of equal-mass galaxy mergers at low and high redshift,
focusing on the induced SF. We find that SNe-driven outflows cannot reduce the
cold accretion at z {\approx} 9 and that SF is actually enhanced due to the
ensuing metal enrichment. We demonstrate how several recent observational
results on galaxy populations (e.g. enhanced HCN/CO ratios in ULIRGs, a
separate Kennicutt Schmidt (KS) sequence for starbursts and the population of
compact early type galaxies (ETGs) at high redshift) can be explained with
mechanisms captured in galaxy merger simulations, provided that the multiphase
nature of the ISM is resolved.

First Kepler results on compact pulsators VIII: Mode identifications via  period spacings in $g-$mode pulsating Subdwarf B stars","
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of nearly-equally spaced periods in 13 hot
subdwarf B (sdB) stars observed with the Kepler spacecraft and one observed
with CoRoT. Asymptotic limits for gravity (g-)mode pulsations provide
relationships between equal period spacings of modes with differing degrees and
relationships between periods of the same radial order but differing degrees.
Period transforms, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and linear least-squares fits have
been used to detect and determine the significance of equal period spacings. We
have also used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the likelihood that the
detected spacings could be produced randomly.
Period transforms for nine of the Kepler stars indicate ell=1 period
spacings, with five also showing peaks for ell=2 modes. 12 stars indicate ell=1
modes using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test while another shows solely ell=2 modes.
Monte Carlo results indicate that equal period spacings are significant in 10
stars above 99% confidence and 13 of the 14 are above 94% confidence. For 12
stars, the various methods find consistent regular period spacing values to
within the errors, two others show some inconsistencies, likely caused by
binarity, and the last has significant detections but the mode assignment
disagrees between methods.
We find a common ell=1 period spacing spanning a range from 231 to 272 s
allowing us to correlate pulsation modes with 222 periodicities and that the
ell=2 period spacings are related to the ell=1 spacings by the asymptotic
relationship $1/\sqrt{3}$. We briefly discuss the impact of equal period
spacings which indicate low-degree modes with a lack of significant mode
trappings.

A new Jeans resolution criterion for (M)HD simulations of  self-gravitating gas: Application to magnetic field amplification by  gravity-driven turbulence","
Abstract: Cosmic structure formation is characterized by the complex interplay between
gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. The processes by which gravitational
energy is converted into turbulent and magnetic energies, however, remain
poorly understood. Here, we show with high-resolution, adaptive-mesh
simulations that MHD turbulence is efficiently driven by extracting energy from
the gravitational potential during the collapse of a dense gas cloud.
Compressible motions generated during the contraction are converted into
solenoidal, turbulent motions, leading to a natural energy ratio of E_sol/E_tot
of approximately 2/3. We find that the energy injection scale of gravity-driven
turbulence is close to the local Jeans scale. If small seeds of the magnetic
field are present, they are amplified exponentially fast via the small-scale
dynamo process. The magnetic field grows most efficiently on the smallest
scales, for which the stretching, twisting, and folding of field lines, and the
turbulent vortices are sufficiently resolved. We find that this scale
corresponds to about 30 grid cells in the simulations. We thus suggest a new
minimum resolution criterion of 30 cells per Jeans length in
(magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of self-gravitating gas, in order to
resolve turbulence on the Jeans scale, and to capture minimum dynamo
amplification of the magnetic field. Due to numerical diffusion, however, any
existing simulation today can at best provide lower limits on the physical
growth rates. We conclude that a small, initial magnetic field can grow to
dynamically important strength on time scales significantly shorter than the
free-fall time of the cloud.

outcome seems most likely for SD SN Ia progenitors where mass-transfer begins
from a giant donor star, and might extend to other SD systems. Not only is the
amount of hydrogen left in such a system below the current detection limit, but
the donor star is typically orders of magnitude smaller than its Roche lobe by
the point when a SD SN Ia occurs, in which case attempts to observe collisions
between SN shocks and giant donor stars seem unlikely to succeed. We consider
the constraints on this model from the circumstellar structures seen in spectra
of SN 2006X and suggest a novel explanation for the origin of this material.

"Title:
Three-dimensional simulations of internal wave breaking and the fate of  planets around solar-type stars","
Abstract: We study the fate of internal gravity waves approaching the centre of a
non-rotating solar-type star, by performing 3D numerical simulations using a
Boussinesq-type model. These waves are excited at the top of the radiation zone
by the tidal forcing of a short-period planet on a circular, coplanar orbit.
This extends previous work done in 2D by Barker & Ogilvie. We first derive a
linear wave solution, which is not exact in 3D; however, the reflection of
ingoing waves from the centre is close to perfect for moderate amplitude waves.
Waves with sufficient amplitude to cause isentropic overturning break, and
deposit their angular momentum near the centre. This forms a critical layer, at
which the angular velocity of the flow matches the orbital angular frequency of
the planet. This efficiently absorbs ingoing waves, and spins up the star from
the inside out, while the planet spirals into the star. We also perform
numerical integrations to determine the linearised adiabatic tidal response
throughout the star, for solar-type stellar models with masses in the range 0.5
< m_star/M_sun < 1.1, throughout their main sequence lifetimes. The aim is to
study the launching region for these waves at the top of the radiation zone in
more detail, and to determine the accuracy of a semi-analytic approximation for
the tidal torque on the star, that was derived under the assumption that all
ingoing wave angular momentum is absorbed in a critical layer. The main
conclusions are that this nonlinear mechanism of tidal dissipation could
provide an explanation for the survival of all short-period extrasolar planets
observed around FGK stars, while it predicts the destruction of more massive
planets. This work provides further support for the model outlined in a
previous paper by Barker & Ogilvie, and makes predictions that will be tested
by ongoing observational studies, such as WASP and Kepler.

"Title:
A more realistic representation of overshoot at the base of the solar  convective envelope as seen by helioseismology","
Abstract: The stratification near the base of the Sun's convective envelope is governed
by processes of convective overshooting and element diffusion, and the region
is widely believed to play a key role in the solar dynamo. The stratification
in that region gives rise to a characteristic signal in the frequencies of
solar p modes, which has been used to determine the depth of the solar
convection zone and to investigate the extent of convective overshoot. Previous
helioseismic investigations have shown that the Sun's spherically symmetric
stratification in this region is smoother than that in a standard solar model
without overshooting, and have ruled out simple models incorporating
overshooting, which extend the region of adiabatic stratification and have a
more-or-less abrupt transition to subadiabatic stratification at the edge of
the overshoot region. In this paper we consider physically motivated models
which have a smooth transition in stratification bridging the region from the
lower convection zone to the radiative interior beneath. We find that such a
model is in better agreement with the helioseismic data than a standard solar
model.

First measurement of Mg isotope abundances at high redshifts and  accurate estimate of Delta alpha/alpha","
Abstract: (Abridged) We use a high-resolution spectrum of the quasar HE0001-2340
observed with the UVES/VLT to measure Mg isotope abundances in the intervening
absorption-line systems at high redshifts. Line profiles are prepared
accounting for possible shifts between the individual exposures. Due to unique
composition of the selected systems - the presence of several transitions of
the same ion - we can test the local accuracy of the wavelength scale
calibration which is the main source of errors in the sub-pixel line position
measurements. In the system at zabs = 0.45 which is probably a fragment of the
outflow caused by SN Ia explosion of high-metallicity white dwarf(s) we
measured velocity shifts of MgII and MgI lines relative to other lines (FeI,
FeII, CaI, CaII): Delta V(MgII) = -0.44 +/- 0.05 km/s and Delta V(MgI) = -0.17
+/- 0.17$ km/s. This translates into the isotopic ratio 24Mg:25Mg:26Mg = (19
+/- 11):(22 +/- 13):(59 +/- 6) with a strong relative overabundance of heavy Mg
isotopes, (25Mg+26Mg)/24Mg = 4, as compared to the solar ratio 24Mg:25Mg:26Mg =
79:10:11, and (25Mg+26Mg)/24Mg = 0.3. At zabs = 1.58, we put a strong
constraint on a putative variation of alpha: Delta alpha/alpha = (-1.5 +/-
2.6)x10^{-6} which is one of the most stringent limits obtained from optical
spectra of QSOs. We reveal that the wavelength calibration in the range above
7500 A is subject to systematic wavelength-dependent drifts.

The Evolution of the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation over the past 6 Gyr","
Abstract: Scaling relations are salient ingredients of galaxy evolution and formation

inverting the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we derived for the first time a
baryonic TFR at high redshift. Conversely to the stellar mass TFR, the baryonic
relation does not appear to evolve in zero point, which suggests that most of
the reservoir of gas converted into stars over the past 6 Gyr was already
gravitationally bound to galaxies at z=0.6.

"Title:
MRI-driven Accretion onto Magnetized stars: Axisymmetric MHD Simulations","
Abstract: We present the first results of a global axisymmetric simulation of accretion
onto rotating magnetized stars from a turbulent, MRI-driven disk. The angular
momentum is transported outward by the magnetic stress of the turbulent flow
with a rate corresponding to a Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter alpha\approx
0.01-0.04. The result of the disk-magnetosphere interaction depends on the
orientation of the poloidal field in the disk relative to that of the star at
the disk-magnetosphere boundary. If fields have the same polarity, then the
magnetic flux is accumulated at the boundary and blocks the accretion which
leads to the accumulation of matter at the boundary. Subsequently, this matter
accretes to the star in outburst before accumulating again. Hence, the cycling,
`bursty' accretion is observed. If the disc and stellar fields have opposite
polarity, then the field reconnection enhances the penetration of the disk
matter towards the deeper field lines of the magnetosphere. However, the
magnetic stress at the boundary is lower due to the field reconnection. This
decreases the accretion rate and leads to smoother accretion at a lower rate.
Test simulations show that in the case of higher accretion rate corresponding
to alpha=0.05-0.1, accretion is bursty in cases of both polarities. On the
other hand, at much lower accretion rates corresponding to alpha < 0.01,
accretion is not bursty in any of these cases. We conclude that the episodic,
bursty accretion is expected during periods of higher accretion rates in the
disc, and in some cases it may alternate between bursty and smooth accretion,
if the disk brings the poloidal field of alternating polarity. We find that a
rotating, magnetically-dominated corona forms above and below the disk, and
that it slowly expands outward, driven by the magnetic force.

Latest Results from the DODO Survey: Imaging Planets around White Dwarfs","
Abstract: The aim of the Degenerate Objects around Degenerate Objects (DODO) survey is
to search for very low mass brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets in wide orbits
around white dwarfs via direct imaging. The direct detection of such companions
would allow the spectroscopic investigation of objects with temperatures lower
(< 500 K) than the coolest brown dwarfs currently observed. The discovery of
planets around white dwarfs would prove that such objects can survive the final
stages of stellar evolution and place constraints on the frequency of planetary
systems around their progenitors (with masses between 1.5 - 8 M*, i.e., early B
to mid-F). An increasing number of planetary mass companions have been directly
imaged in wide orbits around young main sequence stars. For example, the
planets around HR 8799 and 1RXS J160929.1 - 210524 are in wide orbits of 24 -
68 AU and 330 AU, respectively. The DODO survey has the ability to directly

"Title:
Gradient expansion, curvature perturbations and magnetized plasmas","
Abstract: The properties of magnetized plasmas are always investigated under the
hypothesis that the relativistic inhomogeneities stemming from the fluid
sources and from the geometry itself are sufficiently small to allow for a
perturbative description prior to photon decoupling. The latter assumption is
hereby relaxed and pre-decoupling plasmas are described within a suitable
expansion where the inhomogeneities are treated to a given order in the spatial
gradients. It is argued that the (general relativistic) gradient expansion
shares the same features of the drift approximation, customarily employed in
the description of cold plasmas, so that the two schemes are physically
complementary in the large-scale limit and for the low-frequency branch of the
spectrum of plasma modes. The two-fluid description, as well as the
magnetohydrodynamical reduction, are derived and studied in the presence of the
spatial gradients of the geometry. Various solutions of the coupled system of
evolution equations in the anti-Newtonian regime and in the quasi-isotropic
approximation are presented. The relation of this analysis to the so-called
separate Universe paradigm is outlined. The evolution of the magnetized
curvature perturbations in the nonlinear regime is addressed for the magnetized
adiabatic mode in the plasma frame.

Variability and Multiwavelength Detected AGN in the GOODS Fields","
Abstract: We identify 85 variable galaxies in the GOODS North and South fields using 5
epochs of HST ACS V-band (F606W) images spanning 6 months. The variables are
identified through significant flux changes in the galaxy's nucleus and
represent ~2% of the survey galaxies. With the aim of studying the active
galaxy population in the GOODS fields, we compare the variability-selected
sample with X-ray and mid-IR AGN candidates. Forty-nine percent of the
variables are associated with X-ray sources identified in the 2Ms Chandra
surveys. Twenty-four percent of X-ray sources likely to be AGN are optical
variables and this percentage increases with decreasing hardness ratio of the
X-ray emission. Stacking of the non-X-ray detected variables reveals marginally
significant soft X-ray emission. Forty-eight percent of mid-IR power-law
sources are optical variables, all but one of which are also X-ray detected.
Thus, about half of the optical variables are associated with either X-ray or
mid-IR power-law emission. The slope of the power-law fit through the Spitzer
IRAC bands indicates that two-thirds of the variables have BLAGN-like SEDs.
Among those galaxies spectroscopically identified as AGN, we observe
variability in 74% of broad-line AGNs and 15% of NLAGNs. The variables are
found in galaxies extending to z~3.6. We compare the variable galaxy colors and
magnitudes to the X-ray and mid-IR sample and find that the non-X-ray detected
variable hosts extend to bluer colors and fainter intrinsic magnitudes. The
variable AGN candidates have Eddington ratios similar to those of X-ray
selected AGN.

highest for the systems with the highest mean mass accretion rates, as can be
expected if the accretion rate correlates with the orbital period. We show that
these properties can be understood by a balance between spin-up due to
accretion and spin-down due to gravitational radiation. Our scenario indicates
that the gravitational radiation emitted by these systems may be detectable by

Detection of A Transient X-ray Absorption Line Intrinsic to the BL  Lacertae Object H 2356-309","
Abstract: Since the launch of the Einstein X-ray Observatory in the 1970s, a number of
broad absorption features have been reported in the X-ray spectra of BL Lac
objects. These features are often interpreted as arising from high velocity
outflows intrinsic to the BL Lac object, therefore providing important
information about the inner environment around the central engine. However,
such absorption features have not been observed more recently with
high-resolution X-ray telescopes such as Chandra and XMM-Newton. In this paper,
we report the detection of a transient X-ray absorption feature intrinsic to
the BL Lac object H 2356-309 with the Chandra X-ray Telescope. This BL Lac
object was observed during XMM cycle 7, Chandra cycle 8 and 10, as part of our
campaign to investigate X-ray absorption produced by the warm-hot intergalactic
medium (WHIM) residing in the foreground large scale superstructure. During one
of the 80 ksec, Chandra cycle 10 observations, a transient absorption feature
was detected at 3.3-sigma (or 99.9% confidence level, accounting for the number
of trials), which we identify as the OVIII K-alpha line produced by an absorber
intrinsic to the BL Lac object. None of the other 11 observations showed this
line. We constrain the ionization parameter (25 <~ Xi <~ 40) and temperature
(10^5 < T < 2.5 10^7 K) of the absorber. This absorber is likely produced by an
outflow with a velocity up to 1,500 km/s. There is a suggestion of possible
excess emission on the long-wavelength side of the absorption line; however,
the derived properties of the emission material are very different from those
of the absorption material, implying it is unlikely a typical P Cygni-type
profile.

embedded stars. We find that the H2O-ice threshold extinction is 4.03+/-0.05

drops to 3.2 mag, equivalent to that found for the Taurus dark cloud, generally
assumed to be the touchstone quiescent cloud against which all other dense
cloud and embedded young stellar object observations are compared. Substructure
in the trough of the silicate band for two sources is attributed to CH3OH and
NH3 in the ices, present at the ~2% and ~5% levels, respectively, relative to
H2O-ice. The correlation of the silicate feature with the E(J-K) color excess
is found to follow a much shallower slope relative to lines of sight that probe
diffuse clouds, supporting the previous results by Chiar et al. (2007).

The Evolution of Isotope Ratios in the Milky Way Galaxy","
Abstract: Isotope ratios have opened a new window into the study of the details of
stellar evolution, supernovae, and galactic chemical evolution. We present the
evolution of the isotope ratios of elemental abundances (from C to Zn) in the
solar neighbourhood, bulge, halo, and thick disk, using chemical evolution
models with updated yields of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and
core-collapse supernovae. The evolutionary history of each element is different
owing to the effects of the initial progenitor mass and metallicity on element
production. In the bulge and thick disk the star formation timescale is shorter
than in the solar neighbourhood, leading to higher [alpha/Fe] ratios. Likewise,
the smaller contribution from Type Ia supernovae in these regions leads to
lower [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also in the bulge, the abundances of [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K,
Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] are higher because of the effect of metallicity on element
production from core-collapse supernovae. According to our predictions, it is
possible to find metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]>-1) that formed in the early Universe
as a result of rapid star formation. The chemical enrichment timescale of the
halo is longer than in the solar neighbourhood, and consequently the ratios of
[(C, F)/Fe] and 12C/13C are higher owing to a significant contribution from
low-mass AGB stars. While the [alpha/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] ratios are the same as in
the solar neighbourhood, the [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] ratios are
predicted to be lower. Furthermore, we predict that isotope ratios such as
24Mg/25,26Mg are larger because of the contribution from low-metallicity
supernovae. Using isotopic ratios it is possible to select stars that formed in
a system with a low chemical enrichment efficiency such as the satellite
galaxies that were accreted onto our own Milky Way Galaxy.

0.35-8.0keV energy band, and contains source positions, source net counts,
fluxes and significances in several energy bands, and information on source
variability. The analysis challenges posed by ChASeM33 and the techniques
adopted to address these challenges are discussed. To constrain the nature of
the detected X-ray source, hardness ratios were constructed and spectra were
fit for 254 sources, followup MMT spectra of 116 sources were acquired, and
cross-correlations with previous X-ray catalogs and other multi-wavelength data
were generated. Based on this effort, 183 of the 662 ChASeM33 sources could be
identified. Finally, the luminosity function for the detected point sources as
well as the one for the X-ray binaries in M33 is presented. The luminosity
functions in the soft band (0.5-2.0 keV) and the hard band (2.0-8.0 keV) have a
limiting luminosity at the 90% completeness limit of 4.0x10^(34) erg/s and
1.6x10^(35) erg/s (for D=817kpc), respectively, which is significantly lower
than what was reported by previous X-ray binary population studies in galaxies
more distant than M33. The resulting distribution is consistent with a dominant
population of high mass X-ray binaries as would be expected for M33.

Density Variations in the NW Star Stream of M31","
Abstract: The Pan Andromeda Archeological Survey (PAndAS) CFHT Megaprime survey of the
M31-M33 system has found a star stream which extends about 120 kpc NW from the
center of M31. The great length of the stream, and the likelihood that it does
not significantly intersect the disk of M31, means that it is unusually well
suited for a measurement of stream gaps and clumps along its length as a test
for the predicted thousands of dark matter sub-halos. The main result of this
paper is that the density of the stream varies between zero and about three
times the mean along its length on scales of 2 to 20 kpc. The probability that
the variations are random fluctuations in the star density is less than 10^-5.
As a control sample we search for density variations at precisely the same
location in stars with metallicity higher than the stream, [Fe/H]=[0, -0.5] and
find no variations above the expected shot noise. The lumpiness of the stream
is not compatible with a low mass star stream in a smooth galactic potential,
nor is it readily compatible with the disturbance caused by the visible M31
satellite galaxies. The stream's density variations appear to be consistent
with the effects of a large population of steep mass function dark matter
sub-halos, such as found in LCDM simulations, acting on an approximately 10Gyr
old star stream. The effects of a single set of halo substructure realizations
are shown for illustration, reserving a statistical comparison for another

$M_*$, thus preserving $U(1)_L$ maximally. The resulting sneutrino is a
distinguishable ADM candidate, oscillating and favored to have weak scale mass.
A fairly large annihilating cross section of such a heavy ADM is available due

from an active nucleus. The combination of a well-defined parent sample and
high-quality imaging allows us to place constraints on the fraction of SDSS
QSOs that host dual accreting black holes separated on kiloparsec (kpc) scales:
~0.3%-0.65%. We derive from this fraction the time spent in a QSO phase during
a typical merger and find a value that is much lower than estimates that arise
from QSO space densities and galaxy merger statistics. We discuss possible
reasons for this difference. Finally, we compare the SMBH mass distributions of
single and dual AGN and find little difference between the two within the
limited statistics of our program, hinting that most SMBH growth happens in the
later stages of a merger process.

"Title:
Period switching in the symbiotic star BX Mon","
Abstract: We report on a detailed analysis of the optical light curve of the symbiotic
system BX Mon, the data of which were gathered from the literature. The light
curve covers the period December 1889 March 2009, with a gap of no observations
between March 1940 and February 1972. The light curve is characterized by
strong oscillations of peak to peak amplitude of 2 to more than 3 magnitudes.
Before the gap the fluctuations were modulated mainly by a period Pa=1373 d,
the diurnal cycle of an observer on the surface of the rotating M giant, whose
sun is the hot component. After the gap the dominant periodicity is Pb=1256 d,
which is the binary period of the system. Higher harmonics as well as a few
beats of the two major periodicities can also be identified in the light curve.
We identify one of the beat periods, Pr=656 d, as the sidereal rotation period
of the giant component of the system. The period switching that took place
during the gap in the observations was possibly associated with a certain
cataclysmic event, hints of which may be recognized in the LC in the first 11
years after the gap. We suggest that the origin of the major oscillations is in
periodic episodes of mass accretion from the M giant onto the hot component of
the system. The event of the period switching is possibly related to an
intensive magnetic activity in the outer layers of the giant star. [abridged]

The Sun's small-scale magnetic elements in Solar Cycle 23","
Abstract: With the unique database from Michelson Doppler Imager aboard the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory in an interval embodying solar cycle 23, the cyclic
behavior of solar small-scale magnetic elements is studied. More than 13
million small-scale magnetic elements are selected, and the following results
are unclosed. (1) The quiet regions dominated the Sun's magnetic flux for about
8 years in the 12.25 year duration of Cycle 23. They contributed (0.94 - 1.44)
$\times 10^{23}$ Mx flux to the Sun from the solar minimum to maximum. The
monthly average magnetic flux of the quiet regions is 1.12 times that of active
regions in the cycle. (2) The ratio of quiet region flux to that of the total
Sun equally characterizes the course of a solar cycle. The 6-month
running-average flux ratio of quiet region had been larger than 90.0% for 28
continuous months from July 2007 to October 2009, which characterizes very well
the grand solar minima of Cycles 23-24. (3) From the small to large end of the
flux spectrum, the variations of numbers and total flux of the network elements
show no-correlation, anti-correlation, and correlation with sunspots,
respectively. The anti-correlated elements, covering the flux of (2.9 -
32.0)$\times 10^{18}$ Mx, occupies 77.2% of total element number and 37.4% of
quiet Sun flux. These results provide insight into reason for anti-correlated
variations of small-scale magnetic activity during the solar cycle.

Modeling the Young Sun's Solar Wind and its Interaction with Earth's  Paleomagnetosphere","
Abstract: We present a focused parameter study of solar wind - magnetosphere
interaction for the young Sun and Earth, $~3.5$ Ga ago, that relies on
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for both the solar wind and the
magnetosphere. By simulating the quiescent young Sun and its wind we are able
to propagate the MHD simulations up to Earth's magnetosphere and obtain a
physically realistic solar forcing of it. We assess how sensitive the young
solar wind is to changes in the coronal base density, sunspot placement and
magnetic field strength, dipole magnetic field strength and the Sun's rotation
period. From this analysis we obtain a range of plausible solar wind conditions
the paleomagnetosphere may have been subject to. Scaling relationships from the
literature suggest that a young Sun would have had a mass flux different from
the present Sun. We evaluate how the mass flux changes with the aforementioned
factors and determine the importance of this and several other key solar and
magnetospheric variables with respect to their impact on the
paleomagnetosphere. We vary the solar wind speed, density, interplanetary
magnetic field strength and orientation as well as Earth's dipole magnetic
field strength and tilt in a number of steady-state scenarios that are
representative of young Sun-Earth interaction. This study is done as a first
step of a more comprehensive effort towards understanding the implications of
Sun-Earth interaction for planetary atmospheric evolution.

Study of Thick CZT Detectors for X-ray and Gamma-Ray Astronomy","
Abstract: CdZnTe (CZT) is a wide bandgap II-VI semiconductor developed for the
spectroscopic detection of X-rays and {\gamma}-rays at room temperature. The
Swift Burst Alert Telescope is using an 5240 cm2 array of 2 mm thick CZT
detectors for the detection of 15-150 keV X-rays from Gamma-Ray Bursts. We
report on the systematic tests of thicker (\geq 0.5 cm) CZT detectors with
volumes between 2 cm3 and 4 cm3 which are potential detector choices for a
number of future X-ray telescopes that operate in the 10 keV to a few MeV
energy range. The detectors contacted in our laboratory achieve Full Width Half
Maximum energy resolutions of 2.7 keV (4.5%) at 59 keV, 3 keV (2.5%) at 122 keV
and 4 keV (0.6%) at 662 keV. The 59 keV and 122 keV energy resolutions are
among the world-best results for \geq 0.5 cm thick CZT detectors. We use the
data set to study trends of how the energy resolution depends on the detector
thickness and on the pixel pitch. Unfortunately, we do not find clear trends,
indicating that even for the extremely good energy resolutions reported here,
the achievable energy resolutions are largely determined by the properties of
individual crystals. Somewhat surprisingly, we achieve the reported results
without applying a correction of the anode signals for the depth of the
interaction. Measuring the interaction depths thus does not seem to be a
pre-requisite for achieving sub-1% energy resolutions at 662 keV.

"Title:
Starlight and Sandstorms: Mass Loss Mechanisms on the AGB","
Abstract: There are strong observational indications that the dense slow winds of cool
luminous AGB stars are driven by radiative pressure on dust grains which form
in the extended atmospheres resulting from pulsation-induced shocks. For carbon
stars, detailed models of outflows driven by amorphous carbon grains show good
agreement with observations. Some still existing discrepancies may be due to a
simplified treatment of cooling in shocks, drift of the grains relative to the
gas, or effects of giant convection cells or dust-induced pattern formation.
For stars with C/O < 1, recent models indicate that absorption by silicate dust
is probably insuffcient to drive their winds. A possible alternative is
scattering by Fe-free silicate grains with radii of a few tenths of a micron.
In this scenario one should expect less circumstellar reddening for M- and
S-type AGB stars than for C-stars with comparable stellar parameters and mass
loss rates.

Are There Age Spreads in Star Forming Regions?","
Abstract: A luminosity spread at a given effective temperature is ubiquitously seen in
the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams of young star forming regions and often
interpreted in terms of a prolonged period (>=10 Myr) of star formation. I
review the evidence that the observed luminosity spreads are genuine and not
caused by astrophysical sources of scatter. I then address whether the
luminosity spreads necessarily imply large age spreads, by comparing HR diagram
ages with ages from independent clocks such as stellar rotation rate, the
presence of circumstellar material and lithium depletion. I argue that whilst
there probably is a true luminosity dispersion, there is little evidence to
support age spreads larger than a few Myr. This paradox could be resolved by
brief periods of rapid accretion during the class I pre main-sequence phase.

White Dwarfs in the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey: the Thin Disk, Thick Disk  and Spheroid Luminosity Functions","
Abstract: We present a magnitude and proper motion limited catalogue of ~10,000 white
dwarf candidates, obtained from the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey by means of reduced
proper motion selection. This catalogue extends to magnitudes r~19.75 and
proper motions as low as mu ~0.05""/yr, and covers nearly three quarters of the
sky. Photometric parallaxes provide distance estimates accurate to ~50%. This
catalogue is used to measure the luminosity functions for disk and spheroid
white dwarfs, using strict velocity cuts to isolate subsamples belonging to
each population. Disk luminosity functions measured in this manner are really a
conglomerate of thin and thick disk objects, due to the significant velocity
overlap between these populations. We introduce a new statistical approach to
the stellar luminosity function for nearby objects that succesfully untangles
the contributions from the different kinematic populations, without the need
for stringent velocity cuts. This improves the statistical power by allowing
all stars to contribute to the luminosity function, even at tangential
velocities where the populations are indistinguishable. This method is
particularly suited to white dwarfs, for which population discrimination by
chemical tagging is not possible. We use this technique to obtain the first
measurement of the thick disk white dwarf luminosity function, while also
improving constraint on both the thin disk and spheroid luminosity functions.
We find that the thin disk, thick disk and spheroid populations contribute to
the local white dwarf density in roughly 79%/16%/5% proportions.

KOI-54: The Kepler Discovery of Tidally-Excited Pulsations and  Brightenings in a Highly Eccentric Binary","
Abstract: Kepler observations of the star HD 187091 (KID 8112039, hereafter KOI-54)
revealed a remarkable light curve exhibiting sharp periodic brightening events
every 41.8 days with a superimposed set of oscillations forming a beating
pattern in phase with the brightenings. Spectroscopic observations revealed
that this is a binary star with a highly eccentric orbit, e=0.83. We are able
to match the Kepler light curve and radial velocities with a nearly face-on
(i=5.5 degree) binary star model in which the brightening events are caused by
tidal distortion and irradiation of nearly identical A stars during their close
periastron passage. The two dominant oscillations in the light curve,
responsible for the beating pattern, have frequencies that are the 91st and
90th harmonic of the orbital frequency. The power spectrum of the light curve,
after removing the binary star brightening component, reveals a large number of
pulsations, 30 of which have a signal-to-noise ratio > 7. Nearly all of these
pulsations have frequencies that are either integer multiples of the orbital
frequency or are tidally-split multiples of the orbital frequency. This pattern
of frequencies unambiguously establishes the pulsations as resonances between
the dynamic tides at periastron and the free oscillation modes of one of the
stars. KOI-54 is only the 4th star to show such a phenomenon, and is by far the
richest in terms of excited modes.

accurate survey of the Galactic HI emission in the southern sky. We discuss RFI
mitigation strategies that have been applied during the data reduction. Most of
the RFI could be cleaned by using prior information on the HI distribution as
well as statistical methods based on median filtering. Narrow line RFI spikes
have been flagged during the first steps of the data processing. Most of these
lines were found to be constant over long periods of time, such data were
replaced by interpolating profiles from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) survey.
Remaining RFI was searched for at any position by a statistical comparison of
all observations within a distance of 0.1 deg. The median and mean of the line
emission was calculated. In cases of significant deviations between both it was
checked in addition whether the associated rms fluctuations exceeded the
typical scatter by a factor of 3. Such data were replaced by the median, which
is found to be least biased by RFI and other artifacts. The median estimator
was found to be equivalent to the mean, which was obtained after rejecting

Why the dark matter of galaxies is clumps of micro-brown-dwarfs and not  Cold Dark Matter","
Abstract: Observations of quasar microlensing by Schild 1996 show the baryonic dark
matter BDM of galaxies is micro-brown-dwarfs, primordial hydrogen-helium
planets formed at the plasma to gas transition 10^13 seconds, in
trillion-planet clumps termed proto-globular-star-clusters PGCs. Large
photon-viscosity {\nu} of the plasma permits supercluster-mass gravitational
fragmentation at 10^12 seconds when the horizon scale L_H = ct is matched by
the Schwarz viscous scale L_SV of Gibson 1996. Voids begin expansion at sonic
speeds c/ 3^1/2, where c is light speed and t is time, explaining 10^25 meter
size regions observed to be devoid of all matter, either BDM or non-baryonic
NBDM. Most of the NBDM is weakly-collisional, strongly-diffusive, neutrino-like
particles. If cold NBDM (CDM) is assumed, it must soon become warm and diffuse
because it is weakly-collisional. It cannot clump and its clumps cannot clump.
CDM is ruled out with 99% confidence by local-group satellite observations of
Kroupa et al. 2010. The satellites are clusters of PGCs. PGCs are recaptured by
the Galaxy on an accretion disk as they freeze and diffuse from its core to
form its BDM halo. Stars form by viscous mergers of primordial gas planets
within PGCs. Stars die by overeating mBDs, making the first chemicals, oceans

Modeling the Sunspot Number Distribution with a Fokker-Planck Equation","
Abstract: Sunspot numbers exhibit large short-timescale (daily-monthly) variation in
addition to longer timescale variation due to solar cycles.
A formal statistical framework is presented for estimating and forecasting
randomness in sunspot numbers on top of deterministic (including chaotic)
models for solar cycles. The Fokker-Planck approach formulated assumes a
specified long-term or secular variation in sunspot number over an underlying
solar cycle via a driver function. The model then describes the observed
randomness in sunspot number on top of this driver function. We consider a
simple harmonic choice for the driver function, but the approach is general and
can easily be extended to include other drivers which account for underlying
physical processes and/or empirical features of the sunspot numbers. The
framework is consistent during both solar maximum and minimum, and requires no
parameter restrictions to ensure non-negative sunspot numbers. Model parameters
are estimated using statistically optimal techniques. The model agrees both
qualitatively and quantitatively with monthly sunspot data even with the
simplistic representation of the periodic solar cycle. This framework should be
particularly useful for solar cycle forecasters and is complementary to
existing modeling techniques. An analytic approximation for the Fokker-Planck
equation is presented, which is analogous to the Euler approximation, which
which allows for efficient maximum likelihood estimation of large data sets
and/or when using difficult to evaluate driver functions.

"Title:
Dynamical effects of stellar mass loss on a Kuiper-like belt","
Abstract: A quarter of DA white dwarfs are metal polluted, yet elements heavier than
helium sink down through the stellar atmosphere on timescales of days. Hence,
these white dwarfs must be currently accreting material containing heavy
elements. Here, we consider whether the scattering of comets or asteroids from
an outer planetary system, following stellar mass loss on the asymptotic giant
branch, can reproduce these observations. We use N-body simulations to
investigate the effects of stellar mass loss on a simple system consisting of a
planetesimal belt whose inner edge is truncated by a planet. Our simulations
find that, starting with a planetesimal belt population fitted to the observed
main sequence evolution, sufficient mass is scattered into the inner planetary
system to explain the inferred heavy element accretion rates. This assumes that
some fraction of the mass scattered into the inner planetary system ends up on
star-grazing orbits, is tidally disrupted and accreted onto the white dwarf.
The simulations also reproduce the observed decrease in accretion rate with
cooling age and predict accretion rates in old (>1Gyr) white dwarfs, in line
with observations. The efficiency we assumed for material scattered into the
inner planetary system to end up on star-grazing orbits is based on a
Solar-like planetary system, since the simulations show that a single planet is
not sufficient. Although the correct level of accretion is reproduced, the
simulations predict a higher fraction of accreting white dwarfs than observed.
This could indicate that evolved planetary systems are less efficient at
scattering bodies onto star-grazing orbits or that dynamical instabilities
post-stellar mass loss cause rapid planetesimal belt depletion for a
significant fraction of systems.

Near-Infrared Spectroscopy of TW Hya: A Revised Spectral Type and  Comparison with Magnetospheric Accretion Models","
Abstract: We present high signal-to-noise, moderate spectral resolution (R ~ 2000-2500)
near-infrared (0.8-5.0 micron) spectroscopy of the nearby T Tauri star TW Hya.
By comparing the spectrum and the equivalent widths of several atomic and
molecular features with those for stars in the IRTF near-infrared library, we
revise the spectral type to M2.5V, which is later than usually adopted (K7V).
This implies a substantially cooler stellar temperature than previously
assumed. Comparison with various pre-main sequence models suggests that TW Hya
is only ~3 Myr old; much younger than the usually adopted 8 - 10 Myr. Analysis
of the relative strengths of the H lines seen in the spectrum yields estimates
for the temperature and density of the emitting region of T_e > 7500 K and n_e
~ 10^{12} - 10^{13} cm^{-3}. The thickness of the emitting region is 10^2 -
10^4 km and the covering fraction is f_\ast ~ 0.04. Our derived physical
parameter values agree with the predictions of the magnetospheric accretion
scenario. The highest signal-to-noise H lines have profiles that indicate
multiple emission components. We derive an excess spectrum (above that of the
M2.5V template) that peaks in the H band. Although our derived veiling values,
~ 0.1, agree with previous estimates, the excess spectrum does not match that
of current models in which this flux is generated by an inner optically thin
disk. We suggest that the excess flux spectrum instead reflects the differences
in atmospheric opacity, gravity, and age between TW Hya and older, higher
gravity field M2.5 dwarfs.

Damping of Electron Density Structures and Implications for Interstellar  Scintillation","
Abstract: The forms of electron density structures in kinetic Alfven wave turbulence
are studied in connection with scintillation. The focus is on small scales $L
\sim 10^8-10^{10}$ cm where the Kinetic Alfv\'en wave (KAW) regime is active in
the interstellar medium. MHD turbulence converts to a KAW cascade, starting at
10 times the ion gyroradius and continuing to smaller scales. These scales are
inferred to dominate scintillation in the theory of Boldyrev et al. From
numerical solutions of a decaying kinetic Alfv\'en wave turbulence model,
structure morphology reveals two types of localized structures, filaments and
sheets, and shows that they arise in different regimes of resistive and
diffusive damping. Minimal resistive damping yields localized current filaments
that form out of Gaussian-distributed initial conditions. When resistive
damping is large relative to diffusive damping, sheet-like structures form. In
the filamentary regime, each filament is associated with a non-localized
magnetic and density structure, circularly symmetric in cross section. Density
and magnetic fields have Gaussian statistics (as inferred from Gaussian-valued
kurtosis) while density gradients are strongly non-Gaussian, more so than
current. This enhancement of non-Gaussian statistics in a derivative field is
expected since gradient operations enhance small-scale fluctuations. The
enhancement of density gradient kurtosis over current kurtosis is not obvious,
yet it suggests that modest fluctuation levels in electron density may yield
large scintillation events during pulsar signal propagation in the interstellar
medium. In the sheet regime the same statistical observations hold, despite the
absence of localized filamentary structures. Probability density functions are
constructed from statistical ensembles in both regimes, showing clear formation
of long, highly non-Gaussian tails.

selection to identify systems that are likely to contain low-mass stars, in
particular M dwarfs and white dwarfs. In total, we found 207 candidates, the
vast majority of which appear to be in eclipsing binary systems. The catalog
described in this paper includes 42 candidate M dwarf / white dwarf pairs, 4
white-dwarf pairs, 59 systems whose colors indicate they are composed of 2 M
dwarfs and whose lightcurve shapes suggest they are in detached eclipsing
binaries, and 28 M dwarf systems whose lightcurve shapes suggest they are in
contact binaries. We find no detached systems with periods longer than 3 days,
thus the majority of our sources are likely to have experienced orbital spin-up
and enhanced magnetic activity. Indeed, twenty-six of twenty-seven M dwarf
systems that we have spectra for show signs of chromospheric magnetic activity,
far higher than the 24% seen in field stars of the same spectral type. We also
find binaries composed of stars that bracket the expected boundary between
partially and fully convective interiors, which will allow the measurement of
the stellar mass-radius relationship across this transition. The majority of
our contact systems have short orbital periods, with small variance (0.02 days)
in the sample near the observed cutoff of 0.22 days. The accumulation of these
stars at short orbital period suggests that the process of angular momentum
loss, leading to period evolution, becomes less efficient at short periods.

observations will not be properly analysed unless inhomogeneities are taken

Abstract: A nonlocal coupling mechanism to directly transfer the energy from
large-scale Magnetohydrodynamic(MHD) Alfven waves to small-scale kinetic Alfven
waves is presented. It is shown that the interaction between a MHD Alfven wave
and a reversely propagating kinetic Alfven wave can generate another kinetic
Alfven wave, and this interaction exists in the plasmas where the thermal to
magnetic pressure ratio is larger than the electron to ion mass ratio. The
proposed nonlocal interaction may have a potential application to account for
the observed electron scale kinetic Alfven waves in the solar wind and solar
corona plasmas.

"Title:
And the winner is: galaxy mass","
Abstract: The environment is known to affect the formation and evolution of galaxies
considerably best visible through the well-known morphology-density
relationship. We study the effect of environment on the evolution of early-type
galaxies for a sample of 3,360 galaxies morphologically selected by visual
inspection from the SDSS in the redshift range 0.05<z<0.06, and analyse
luminosity-weighted age, metallicity, and alpha/Fe ratio as function of
environment and galaxy mass. We find that on average 10 per cent of early-type
galaxies are rejuvenated through minor recent star formation. This fraction
increases with both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasing environmental
density. However, the bulk of the population obeys a well-defined scaling of
age, metallicity, and alpha/Fe ratio with galaxy mass that is independent of
environment. Our results contribute to the growing evidence in the recent
literature that galaxy mass is the major driver of galaxy formation. Even the
morphology-density relationship may actually be mass-driven, as the consequence
of an environment dependent characteristic galaxy mass coupled with the fact
that late-type galaxy morphologies are more prevalent in low-mass galaxies.

"Title:
Transformation of the angular power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave  Background (CMB) radiation into reciprocal spaces and consequences of this  approach","
Abstract: The formalism of solid state physics has been applied to provide an
additional tool for the research of cosmological problems. It is demonstrated
how this new approach could be useful in the analysis of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) data. After a transformation of the anisotropy spectrum of
relict radiation into a special two-fold reciprocal space it was possible to
propose a simple and general description of the interaction of relict photons
with the matter by a ""relict radiation factor"". This factor enabled us to
process the transformed CMB anisotropy spectrum by a Fourier transform and thus
arrive to a radial electron density distribution function (RDF) in a reciprocal
space. As a consequence it was possible to estimate distances between Objects
of the order ~100 [m] and the density of the ordinary matter ~1E-22 [kg.m-3].
Another analysis based on a direct calculation of the CMB radiation spectrum
after its transformation into a simple reciprocal space and combined with
appropriate structure modeling confirmed the cluster structure. The internal
structure of Objects may be formed by Clusters distant 12 [cm], whereas the
internal structure of a Cluster consisted of particles distant ~0.3 [nm]. This
work points unequivocally to clustering processes and to a cluster-like
structure of the matter and thus contributes to the understanding of the
structure of density fluctuations. Simultaneously it sheds more light on the
structure of the universe in the moment when the universe became transparent
for photons. Clustering may be at the same time a new physical effect which has
not been taken fully into consideration in the past. On the basis of our
quantitative considerations it was possible to estimate the number of particles
(protons, helium nuclei, electrons and other particles) in Objects and Clusters
and the number of Clusters in an Object.

Study of Planetary Systems around Giant Stars","
Abstract: More than 450 exoplanets have currently been detected, most of them by the

scenarios for planets around intermediate-mass stars and the effect of the
post-MS evolution of the host stars on the orbits of close-in planets (a 0.6

Phenomenology of a Pseudo-Scalar Inflaton: Naturally Large  Nongaussianity","
Abstract: Many controlled realizations of chaotic inflation employ pseudo-scalar
axions. Pseudo-scalars \phi are naturally coupled to gauge fields through c
\phi F \tilde{F}. In the presence of this coupling, gauge field quanta are
copiously produced by the rolling inflaton. The produced gauge quanta, in turn,
source inflaton fluctuations via inverse decay. These new cosmological
perturbations add incoherently with the ""vacuum"" perturbations, and are highly
nongaussian. This provides a natural mechanism to generate large nongaussianity
in single or multi field slow-roll inflation. The resulting phenomenological
signatures are highly distinctive: large nongaussianity of (nearly) equilateral
shape, in addition to detectably large values of both the scalar spectral tilt
and tensor-to-scalar ratio (both being typical of large field inflation). The
WMAP bound on nongaussianity implies that the coupling, c, of the pseudo-scalar
inflaton to any gauge field must be smaller than about 10^{2} M_p^{-1}.

Problems of Collisional Stellar Dynamics","
Abstract: The discovery of dynamical friction was Chandrasekhar's best known

few-body problem to the limit of large N (in effect, galaxies). Much of this
work was summarised in the text ""Principles of Stellar Dynamics"" (Chandrasekhar

through a long analysis of galaxy models, to the behaviour of star clusters in
tidal fields. The later edition also includes the work on dynamical friction
and related issues. In this review we focus on progress in the collisional
aspects of these problems, i.e. those where few-body interactions play a
dominant role, and so we omit further discussion of galaxy dynamics. But we try
to link Chandrasekhar's fundamental discoveries in collisional problems with
the progress that has been made in the 50 years since the publication of the

influence of the contaminations, including cosmic weak lensing, various

Core-crust transition in neutron stars: predictivity of density  developments","
Abstract: The possibility to draw links between the isospin properties of nuclei and
the structure of compact stars is a stimulating perspective. In order to pursue
this objective on a sound basis, the correlations from which such links can be

development of the corresponding equation of state: this establishes to what
extent a limited set of phenomenological constraints can determine the
core-crust transition properties. From a correlation analysis we show that a)
the transition density $\rho_t$ is mainly correlated with the symmetry energy

A massive association around the obscured open cluster RSGC3","
Abstract: Four clusters of red supergiants have been discovered in a region of the
Milky Way close to base of the Scutum-Crux Arm and the tip of the Long Bar.
Population synthesis models indicate that they must be very massive to harbour
so many supergiants. The spatial extent of one of these clusters, RSGC3, has
not been investigated. We utilised 2MASS JHK photometry to identify candidate
obscured luminous red stars in the vicinity of RSGC3. We observed a sample of
candidates with the TWIN spectrograph on the 3.5-m telescope at Calar Alto,
obtaining intermediate-resolution spectroscopy in the 8000-9000A range. We
re-evaluated a number of classification criteria proposed in the literature for
this spectral range and found that we could use our spectra to derive spectral
types and luminosity classes. We measured the radial velocity of five members
of RSGC3, finding velocities similar to the average for members of Stephenson2.
Among the candidates observed outside the cluster, our spectra revealed eight
M-type supergiants at distances <18arcmin from the centre of RSGC3, distributed
in two clumps. The southern clump is most likely another cluster of red
supergiants, with reddening and age identical to RSGC3. From 2MASS photometry,
we identified four likely supergiant members of the cluster in addition to the
five spectroscopically observed. The northern clump may be a small cluster with
similar parameters. Photometric analysis of the area around RSGC3 suggests the
presence of a large (>30) population of red supergiants with similar colours,
suggesting that the massive cluster RSGC3 is surrounded by an extended
association, which may be very massive (>10E5M_sun). We also show that
supergiants in the Scutum Complex may be characterised via a combination of
2MASS photometry and intermediate-to-high-resolution spectroscopy in the Z band

propagating modes both for the odd-type and the even-type perturbations and

High-precision photometry of WASP-12 b transits","
Abstract: The transiting extrasolar planet WASP-12 b was found to be one of the most
intensely irradiated exoplanets. It is unexpectedly bloated and is losing mass
that may accrete into the host star. Our aim was to refine the parameters of
this intriguing system and search for signs of transit timing variations. We
gathered high-precision light curves for two transits of WASP-12 b. Assuming
various limb-darkening laws, we generated best-fitting models and redetermined
parameters of the system. Error estimates were derived by the prayer bead
method and Monte Carlo simulations. System parameters obtained by us are found
to agree with previous studies within one sigma. Use of the non-linear
limb-darkening laws results in the best-fitting models. With two new
mid-transit times, the ephemeris was refined to BJD(TDB)=(2454508.97682 +/-
0.00020) + (1.09142245 +/- 0.00000033) E. Interestingly, indications of transit
timing variation are detected at the level of 3.4 sigma. This signal can be
induced by an additional planet in the system. Simplified numerical simulations
shows that a perturber could be a terrestrial-type planet if both planets are
in a low-order orbital resonance. However, we emphasise that further
observations are needed to confirm variation and to constrain properties of the
perturber.

Observations and modeling of H_2 fluorescence with partial frequency  redistribution in giant planet atmospheres","
Abstract: Partial frequency redistribution (PRD), describing the formation of the line
profile, has negligible observational effects for optical depths smaller than
~10^3, at the resolving power of most current instruments. However, when the
spectral resolution is sufficiently high, PRD modeling becomes essential in
interpreting the line shapes and determining the total line fluxes. We
demonstrate the effects of PRD on the H_2 line profiles observed at high
spectral resolution by the Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) in the
atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. In these spectra, the asymmetric shapes of
the lines in the Lyman (v""- 6) progression pumped by the solar Ly-beta are
explained by coherent scattering of the photons in the line wings. We introduce
a simple computational approximation to mitigate the numerical difficulties of
radiative transfer with PRD, and show that it reproduces the exact radiative
transfer solution to better than 10%. The lines predicted by our radiative
transfer model with PRD, including the H_2 density and temperature distribution
as a function of height in the atmosphere, are in agreement with the line
profiles observed by FUSE. We discuss the observational consequences of PRD,
and show that this computational method also allows us to include PRD in
modeling the continuum pumped H_2 fluorescence, treating about 4000 lines
simultaneously.

"Title:
The Density and Pseudo-Phase-Space Density Profiles of CDM halos","
Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations indicate that the spherically-averaged
density profiles of cold dark matter halos are accurately described by Einasto
profiles, where the logarithmic slope is a power-law of adjustable exponent,
\gamma =dln\rho /dlnr ~ r^\alpha $. The pseudo-phase-space density (PPSD)
profiles of CDM halos also show remarkable regularity, and are well
approximated by simple power laws, Q(r)=\rho /\sigma ^3 ~ r^-\chi . We show
that this is expected from dynamical equilibrium considerations, since Jeans'
equations predict that the pseudo-phase-space density profiles of Einasto halos
should resemble power laws over a wide range of radii. For the values of \alpha
typical of CDM halos, the inner Q profiles of equilibrium halos deviate
significantly from a power law only very close to the center, and simulations
of extremely high-resolution would be needed to detect such deviations
unambiguously. We use an ensemble of halos drawn from the Millennium-II
simulation to study which of these two alternatives describe best the mass
profile of CDM halos. Our analysis indicates that at the resolution of the best
available simulations, both Einasto and power-law PPSD profiles (with
adjustable exponents \alpha and \chi, respectively) provide equally acceptable
fits to the simulations. A full account of the structure of CDM halos requires
understanding how the shape parameters that characterize departures from
self-similarity, like \alpha or \chi, are determined by evolutionary history,
environment or initial conditions.

Collision of two general geodesic particles around a Kerr black hole","
Abstract: We obtain an explicit expression for the center-of-mass (CM) energy of two
colliding general geodesic massive and massless particles at any spacetime
point around a Kerr black hole. Applying this, we show that the CM energy can
be arbitrarily high only in the limit to the horizon and then derive a formula
for the CM energy of two general geodesic particles colliding near the horizon
in terms of the conserved quantities of each particle and the polar angle. We
present the necessary and sufficient condition for the CM energy to be
arbitrarily high in terms of the conserved quantities of each particle. To have
an arbitrarily high CM energy, the angular momentum of either of the two
particles must be fine-tuned to the critical value
$L_{i}=\Omega_{H}^{-1}E_{i}$, where $\Omega_{H}$ is the angular velocity of the
horizon and $E_{i}$ and $L_{i}$ are the energy and angular momentum of particle
$i$ ($=1,2$), respectively. We show that, in the direct collision scenario, the
collision with an arbitrarily high CM energy can occur near the horizon of
maximally rotating black holes not only at the equator but also on a belt
centered at the equator. This belt lies between latitudes $\pm
acos(\sqrt{3}-1)\simeq \pm 42.94^{\circ}$. This is also true in the scenario
through the collision of a last stable orbit particle.

VLA and ATCA Search for Natal Star Clusters in Nearby Star-Forming  Galaxies","
Abstract: In order to investigate the relationship between the local environment and
the properties of natal star clusters, we obtained radio observations of 25
star-forming galaxies within 20 Mpc using the Very Large Array (VLA) and the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Natal star-forming regions can be
identified by their characteristic thermal radio emission, which is manifest in
their spectral index at centimeter wavelengths. The host galaxies in our sample
were selected based upon their likelihood of harboring young star formation. In
star-forming regions, the ionizing flux of massive embedded stars powers the
dominant thermal free-free emission of those sources, resulting in a spectral
index of {\alpha} {\gtrsim} -0.2 (where S{\nu} {\propto} {\nu}{\alpha}), which
we compute. With the current sensitivity, we find that of the 25 galaxies in
this sample only five have radio sources with spectral indices that are only
consistent with a thermal origin; four have radio sources that are only
consistent with a non-thermal origin; six have radio sources whose nature is
ambiguous due to uncertainties in the spectral index; and sixteen have no
detected radio sources. For those sources that appear to be dominated by
thermal emission, we infer the ionizing flux of the star clusters and the
number of equivalent O7.5 V stars that are required to produce the observed
radio flux densities. The most radio-luminous clusters that we detect have an
equivalent of ~7x103 O7.5 V stars, and the smallest only have an equivalent of
~102 O7.5 V stars; thus these star-forming regions span the range of large
OB-associations to moderate ""super star clusters"" (SSCs). With the current
detection limits, we also place upper limits on the masses of clusters that
could have recently formed...

Abstract: We present the search methods and initial results for transient radio signals
in the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) Survey. The HTRU survey's
single-pulse search, the software designed to perform the search, and a

Initial processing of a small fraction of the survey has produced 11
discoveries, all of which are sparsely-emitting neutron stars, as well as
provided confirmation of two previously unconfirmed neutron stars. Most of the
newly discovered objects lie in regions surveyed previously, indicating both
the improved sensitivity of the HTRU survey observing system and the dynamic
nature of the radio sky. The cycles of active and null states in nulling
pulsars, rotating radio transients (RRATs), and long-term intermittent pulsars
are explored in the context of determining the relationship between these
populations, and of the sensitivity of a search to the various
radio-intermittent neutron star populations. This analysis supports the case
that many RRATs are in fact high-null-fraction pulsars (i. e. with null
fraction >~0.95), and indicates that intermittent pulsars appear distinct from
nulling pulsars in their activity cycle timescales. We find that in the
measured population, there is a deficit of pulsars with typical emission
timescales greater than ~300 s that is not readily explained by selection
effects. The HTRU low-latitude survey will be capable of addressing whether
this deficit is physical. We predict that the HTRU survey will explore pulsars
with a broad range of nulling fractions (up to and beyond 0.999), and at its
completion is likely to increase the currently known RRATs by a factor of more
than two.

Transit Timing Observations from Kepler: I. Statistical Analysis of the  First Four Months","
Abstract: The architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraints
on models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation of
orbital eccentricities and inclinations. NASA's Kepler mission has identified
1235 transiting planet candidates (Borcuki et al 2011). The method of transit
timing variations (TTVs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetary
systems (Holman et al. 2010; Lissauer et al. 2011a). We perform a transit
timing analysis of the Kepler planet candidates. We find that at least ~12% of
planet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive
of TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span
of observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet
masses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple
transiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We
find that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does
not vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per
star, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a
single transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. We
anticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with
multiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs. Thus, TTVs will provide a
powerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital
dynamics of low-mass planets. If Kepler observations were extended to at least
six years, then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the
dynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive
to planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type
stars.

of observability by more than a factor of 100 in amplitude. We also explicitly
demonstrate that the bispectrum consistency relation with the local slope of
the power spectrum is satisfied for these models. In the GSR approach, the
bispectrum arises from integrals of nearly the same function of the background
slow-roll parameters as the power spectrum but with a stronger weight to the
epoch before horizon crossing. Hence this technique enables reverse engineering
of models with large bispectrum but small power spectrum features.

Naked Singularities as Particle Accelerators II","
Abstract: We generalize here our earlier results on particle acceleration by naked
singularities. We showed recently[1] that the naked singularities that form due
to gravitational collapse of massive stars provide a suitable environment where
particles could get accelerated and collide at arbitrarily high center of mass
energies. However, we focussed there only on the spherically symmetric
gravitational collapse models, which were also assumed to be self-similar. In
this paper, we broaden and generalize the result to all gravitational collapse
models leading to the formation of a naked singularity as final state of
collapse, evolving from a regular initial data, without making any prior
restrictive assumptions about the spacetime symmetries such as above. We show
that when the particles interact and collide near the Cauchy horizon, the
energy of collision in the center of mass frame will be arbitrarily high, thus
offering a window to the Planck scale physics. We also consider the issue of
various possible physical mechanisms of generation of such very high energy
particles from the vicinity of naked singularity. We then construct a model of
gravitational collapse to a timelike naked singularity to demonstrate the
working of these ideas, where the pressure is allowed to be negative but the
energy conditions are respected. We show that a finite amount of mass-energy
density has to be necessarily radiated away from the vicinity of the naked
singularity as the collapse evolves. Therefore the nature of naked
singularities, both at classical and quantum level could play an important role
in the process of particle acceleration, explaining the occurrence of highly
energetic outgoing particles in the vicinity of Cauchy horizon that participate
in extreme high energy collisions.

migration simulations begin with Jupiter and Saturn on orbits already well
separated from their mutual 2:1 mean-motion resonance. Neptune and Uranus are
decoupled from each other and have orbital eccentricities damped to near their
current values. From this point we adopt a planet migration model in which the
migration speed decreases exponentially with a characteristic timescale tau
(the e-folding time). We perform a series of numerical simulations, each
involving the migrating giant planets plus test particle Trojans and
quasi-satellites. We find that the libration frequencies of Trojans are similar
to those of quasi-satellites. This similarity enables a dynamical exchange of
objects back and forth between the Trojan and quasi-satellite resonances during
planetary migration. Furthermore, under the influence of these secondary
resonances quasi-satellites can have their libration amplitudes enlarged until
they undergo a close-encounter with their host planet and escape from the
resonance. High-resolution simulations of this escape process reveal that ~80%
of Jovian quasi-satellites experience one or more close-encounters within
Jupiter's Hill radius (R_H) as they are forced out of the quasi-satellite
resonance. As many as ~20% come within R_H/4 and ~2.5% come within R_H/10.
Close-encounters of escaping quasi-satellites occur near or even below the
2-body escape velocity from the host planet.

"Title:
Runaway accretion of metals from compact debris disks onto white dwarfs","
Abstract: It was recently proposed that metal-rich white dwarfs (WDs) accrete their
metals from compact debris disks found to exist around more than a dozen of
them. At the same time, elemental abundances measured in atmospheres of some
WDs imply vigorous metal accretion at rates up to $10^{11}$ g/s, far in excess
of what can be supplied solely by Poynting-Robertson drag acting on such debris
disks. To explain this observation we propose a model, in which rapid transport
of metals from the disk onto the WD naturally results from interaction between
this particulate disk and spatially coexisting disk of metallic gas. The latter
is fed by evaporation of debris particles at the sublimation radius located at
several tens of WD radii. Because of pressure support gaseous disk orbits WD
slower than particulate disk. Resultant azimuthal drift between them at speed
~1 m/s causes aerodynamic drag on the disk of solids and drives inward
migration of its constituent particles. Upon reaching the sublimation radius
particles evaporate, enhancing the density of metallic gaseous disk and leading
to positive feedback. Under favorable circumstances (low viscosity in the disk
of metallic gas and efficient aerodynamic coupling between the disks) system
evolves in a runaway fashion, destroying debris disk on time scale of $\sim
10^5$ yr, and giving rise to high metal accretion rates up to $10^{10}-10^{11}$
g/s, in agreement with observations.

The Luminosity Functions and Timescales of MYSOs and Compact HII regions","
Abstract: We present a determination of the luminosity functions of massive young
stellar objects (MYSOs) and compact (C)HII regions within the Milky Way Galaxy
using the large, well-selected sample of these sources identified by the Red
MSX Source (RMS) survey. The MYSO luminosity function decreases monotonically
such that there are few with $L\gtrsim 10^{5}$Lsol, whilst the CHII regions are
detected up to ~10$^{6}Lsol. The lifetimes of these phases are also calculated
as a function of luminosity by comparison with the luminosity function for
local main-sequence OB stars. These indicate that the MYSO phase has a duration
ranging from 4x10$^{5}$ yrs for 10$^{4}$Lsol to ~7x10$^{4}$ yrs at
10$^{5}$Lsol, whilst the CHII region phase lasts of order 3x10$^{5}$ yrs or
~3-10% of the exciting star's main-sequence lifetime. MYSOs between 10$^{4}
Lsol and ~10$^{5}$ Lsol are massive but do not display the radio continuum or
near-IR \HI{} recombination line emission indicative of an HII region,
consistent with being swollen due to high ongoing or recent accretion rates.
Above ~10$^{5}$ Lsol the MYSO phase lifetime becomes comparable to the
main-sequence Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, at which point the central star can
rapidly contract onto the main-sequence even if still accreting, and ionise a
CHII region, thus explaining why few highly luminous MYSOs are observed.

pulse-profiles of the ""off-states"" are also presented. Eventually, we discuss
our findings in framework of the ""gated accretion"" scenario and conclude that
most likely the residual flux is due to the accretion of matter leaking through
the magnetosphere by means of Kelvin-Helmholz instabilities (KHI).

"Title:
Warm dust resolved in the cold disk around T Cha with VLTI/AMBER","
Abstract: The transition between massive Class II circumstellar disks and Class III
debris disks, with dust residuals, has not yet been clearly understood. Disks
are expected to dissipate with time, and dust clearing in the inner regions can
be the consequence of several mechanisms. Planetary formation is one of them
that will possibly open a gap inside the disk. According to recent models based
on photometric observations, T Cha is expected to present a large gap within
its disk, meaning that an inner dusty disk is supposed to have survived close
to the star. We investigate this scenario with new near-infrared
interferometric observations. We observed T Cha in the H and K bands using the
AMBER instrument at VLTI and used the MCFOST radiative transfer code to model
the SED of T Cha and the interferometric observations simultaneously and to
test the scenario of an inner dusty structure. We also used a toy model of a
binary to check that a companion close to the star can reproduce our
observations. The scenario of a close (few mas) companion cannot satisfactorily
reproduce the visibilities and SED, while a disk model with a large gap and an
inner ring producing the bulk of the emission (in H and K-bands) close to 0.1
AU is able to account for all the observations. With this study, the presence
of an optically thick inner dusty disk close to the star and dominating the H
and K- bands emission is confirmed. According to our model, the large gap
extends up to ~ 7.5 AU. This points toward a companion (located at several AU)
gap-opening scenario to explain the morphology of T Cha.

Radiation hydrodynamics with Adaptive Mesh Refinement and application to  prestellar core collapse. I Methods","
Abstract: Radiative transfer has a strong impact on the collapse and the fragmentation
of prestellar dense cores. We present the radiation-hydrodynamics solver we
designed for the RAMSES code. The method is designed for astrophysical
purposes, and in particular for protostellar collapse. We present the solver,
using the co-moving frame to evaluate the radiative quantities. We use the
popular flux limited diffusion approximation, under the grey approximation (one
group of photon). The solver is based on the second-order Godunov scheme of
RAMSES for its hyperbolic part, and on an implicit scheme for the radiation
diffusion and the coupling between radiation and matter. We report in details
our methodology to integrate the RHD solver into RAMSES. We test successfully
the method against several conventional tests. For validation in 3D, we perform
calculations of the collapse of an isolated 1 M_sun prestellar dense core,
without rotation. We compare successfully the results with previous studies
using different models for radiation and hydrodynamics. We have developed a
full radiation hydrodynamics solver in the RAMSES code, that handles adaptive
mesh refinement grids. The method is a combination of an explicit scheme and an
implicit scheme, accurate to the second-order in space. Our method is well
suited for star formation purposes. Results of multidimensional dense core
collapse calculations with rotation are presented in a companion paper.

Abstract: The transmission rate of communication between radio telescopes on Earth and
extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) is here calculated up to distances of 1000
light years. Both phase-shift-keying (PSK) and frequency-shift keying (FSK)

common drift rate can be the probable signals of ETI. Modern SETI spectrum
analyzers are well suited to searching for these types of signals. Such signals
can be detected using the Hough transform which is a dedicated tool for
detecting patterns in an image. The time-frequency plane representing the power
output of the spectrum analyzer during the search for ETI gives an image from
which the Hough transform (HT) can detect signal patterns with frequency drift.

Testing a direction-dependent primordial power spectrum with  observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background","
Abstract: Statistical isotropy is often assumed in cosmology and should be tested
rigorously against observational data. We construct simple quadratic estimators
to reconstruct asymmetry in the primordial power spectrum from CMB temperature
and polarization data and verify their accuracy using simulations with
quadrupole power asymmetry. We show that the Planck mission, with its millions
of signal-dominated modes of the temperature anisotropy, should be able to
constrain the amplitude of any spherical multipole of a scale-invariant
quadrupole asymmetry at the $0.01$ level ($2\sigma$). Almost independent
constraints can be obtained from polarization at the $0.03$ level after four
full-sky surveys, providing an important consistency test. If the amplitude of
the asymmetry is large enough, constraining its scale-dependence should become
possible. In scale-free quadrupole models with $1\%$ asymmetry, consistent with
the current limits from WMAP temperature data (after correction for beam
asymmetries), Planck should constrain the spectral index $q$ of power-law
departures from asymmetry to $\Delta q = 0.3$. Finally, we show how to
constrain models with axisymmetry in the same framework. For scale-free
quadrupole models, Planck should constrain the direction of the asymmetry to a
$1\sigma$ accuracy of about $2$ degrees using one year of temperature data.

"Title:
The Onset of Chaos in Pulsating Variable Stars","
Abstract: Random changes in pulsation period occur in cool pulsating Mira variables,
Type A, B, and C semiregular variables, RV Tauri variables, and in most
classical Cepheids. The physical processes responsible for such fluctuations
are uncertain, but presumably originate in temporal modifications of the
envelope convection in such stars. Such fluctuations are seemingly random over
a few pulsation cycles of the stars, but are dominated by the regularity of the
primary pulsation over the long term. The magnitude of stochasticity in
pulsating stars appears to be linked directly to their dimensions, although not
in simple fashion. It is relatively larger in M supergiants, for example, than
in short-period Cepheids, but is common enough that it can be detected in
visual observations for many types of pulsating stars. Although chaos was
discovered in such stars 80 years ago, detection of its general presence in the
group has only been possible in recent studies.

Two-dimensional kinematics of SLACS lenses: III. Mass structure and  dynamics of early-type lens galaxies beyond z ~ 0.1","
Abstract: We combine in a self-consistent way the constraints from both gravitational
lensing and stellar kinematics to perform a detailed investigation of the
internal mass distribution, amount of dark matter, and dynamical structure of
the 16 early-type lens galaxies from the SLACS Survey, at z = 0.08 - 0.33, for
which both HST/ACS and NICMOS high-resolution imaging and VLT VIMOS IFU
spectroscopy are available. Based on this data set, we analyze the inner
regions of the galaxies, i.e. typically within one (3D) effective radius r_e,
under the assumption of axial symmetry and by constructing dynamical models
supported by two-integral stellar DFs. For all systems, the total mass density
distribution is found to be well approximated by a simple power-law: this
profile is on average slightly super-isothermal, with a logarithmic slope
<gamma'> = 2.074^{+0.043}_{-0.041} (68% CL) and an intrinsic scatter
0.144^{+0.055}_{-0.014}, and is fairly round, with an average axial ratio <q> =
0.77+/-0.04. The lower limit for the dark matter fraction (fDM) inside r_e
ranges, in individual systems, from nearly zero to almost a half, with a median
value of 12%. By including stellar masses derived from SPS models with a
Salpeter IMF, we obtain an average fDM = 31%. The fDM rises to 61% if, instead,
a Chabrier IMF is assumed. For both IMFs, the dark matter fraction increases
with the total mass of the galaxy (3-sigma correlation). Based on the intrinsic
angular momentum parameter calculated from our models, we find that the
galaxies can be divided into two dynamically distinct groups, which are shown
to correspond to the usual classes of the slow and fast rotators. Overall, the
SLACS systems are structurally and dynamically very similar to their nearby
counterparts, indicating that the inner regions of early-type galaxies have
undergone little, if any, evolution since redshift z ~ 0.35. (Abridged)

Population study for gamma-ray pulsars; II Millisecond pulsars","
Abstract: The population of $\gamma$-ray emitting millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is studied
by using Monte-Carlo techniques. We simulate the Galactic distributions of the
MSPs, and apply the outer gap model for the $\gamma$-ray emission from each
simulated MSP. We take into account the dependence of the observed $\gamma$-ray
flux on the viewing angle and inclination angle, which is the angle between the
rotation axis and the magnetic axis, respectively. Using the sensitivity of the
six-month long observation of the $Fermi$ telescope and radio sensitivities of
existing pulsar surveys, 9-13 radio-selected and 22-35 $\gamma$-ray-selected
pulsars are detected within our simulation. The statistical properties of the
simulated population are consistent with the $Fermi$ observations. Scaling the
observed sensitivity $\propto \sqrt{T}$, where $T$ is the length of observation
time, the present model predicts that over the 5-year mission $Fermi$ would
detect 15-22 radio-selected $\gamma$-ray MSPs, and 95-152 $\gamma$-ray-selected
MSPs. Our simulation also predicts that about 100 (or 200-300) $\gamma$-ray
MSPs with a flux larger $F\ge 10^{-11}~\mathrm{erg/cm^2 s}$ (or $5\times
10^{-12}~\mathrm{erg/cm^2 s}$) irradiate the Earth. With the present
sensitivities of the radio surveys, most of them are categorized as
$\gamma$-ray-selected pulsars, indicating that most of the $\gamma$-ray MSPs
have been missed by the present $Fermi$ observations. We argue that the
Galactic $Fermi$ unidentified sources located at high latitudes should be
dominated by MSPs, whereas the sources in the galactic plane are dominated by
radio-quiet canonical pulsars.

The neutrino-neutrino interaction effects in supernovae: the point of  view from the 'matter' basis","
Abstract: We consider the Hamiltonian for neutrino oscillations in matter in the case
of arbitrary potentials including off-diagonal complex terms. We derive the
'matter basis' Hamiltonian in terms of quantities one can derive from the
flavor basis Hamiltonian and its derivative, for an arbitrary number of
neutrino flavors. We make our expressions explicit for the two-neutrino flavor
case and apply our results to the situation where the Hamiltonian includes both

core-collapse supernovae. We show that the neutrino flavour evolution depends
on the mixing matrix derivatives involving not only the derivative of the
matter mixing angles but also of the phases. In particular, we point out the
important role of the phase derivatives, that appear due to the
neutrino-neutrino interaction, and show how it can cause an oscillating
degeneracy between the diagonal elements of the matter basis Hamiltonian. Our
results also reveal, that the end of the synchronization regime is due to a
rapid increase of the phase derivative, and identify the condition to be
fulfilled for the onset of bipolar oscillations involving both the off-diagonal
neutrino-neutrino interaction contributions and the vacuum terms.

"Title:
Spin-Up/Spin-Down models for Type Ia Supernovae","
Abstract: In the single degenerate scenario for Type Ia supernova (SNeIa), a white
dwarf (WD) must gain a significant amount of matter from a companion star.
Because the accreted mass carries angular momentum, the WD is likely to achieve
fast spin periods, which can increase the critical mass, $M_{crit}$, needed for
explosion. When $M_{crit}$ is higher than the maximum mass achieved by the WD,
the WD must spin down before it can explode. This introduces a delay between
the time at which the WD has completed its epoch of mass gain and the time of
the explosion. Matter ejected from the binary during mass transfer therefore
has a chance to become diffuse, and the explosion occurs in a medium with a
density similar to that of typical regions of the interstellar medium. Also,
either by the end of the WD's mass increase or else by the time of explosion,
the donor may exhaust its stellar envelope and become a WD. This alters,
generally diminishing, explosion signatures related to the donor star.
Nevertheless, the spin-up/spin-down model is highly predictive. Prior to
explosion, progenitors can be super-$M_{Ch}$ WDs in either wide binaries with
WD companions, or else in cataclysmic variables. These systems can be
discovered and studied through wide-field surveys. Post explosion, the
spin-up/spin-down model predicts a population of fast-moving WDs, low-mass
stars, and even brown dwarfs. In addition, the spin-up/spin-down model provides
a paradigm which may be able to explain both the similarities and the diversity
observed among SNeIa.

Breaking down the link between luminous and dark matter in massive  galaxies","
Abstract: We present a study on the clustering of a stellar mass selected sample of
galaxies with stellar masses M*>10^10Msol at redshifts 0.4<z<2.0, taken from
the Palomar Observatory Wide-field Infrared Survey. We examine the clustering
properties of these stellar mass selected samples as a function of redshift and
stellar mass, and find that galaxies with high stellar masses have a
progressively higher clustering strength than galaxies with lower stellar
masses. We also find that galaxies within a fixed stellar mass range have a
higher clustering strength at higher redshifts. We further estimate the average
total masses of the dark matter haloes hosting these stellar-mass selected
galaxies. For all galaxies in our sample the stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio
is always lower than the universal baryonic mass fraction and the
stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio is strongly correlated with the halo masses
for central galaxies, such that more massive haloes contain a lower fraction of
their mass in the form of stars. The remaining baryonic mass is included
partially in stars within satellite galaxies in these haloes, and as diffuse
hot and warm gas. We also find that, at a fixed stellar mass, the
stellar-to-total-mass ratio increases at lower redshifts. This suggests that
galaxies at a fixed stellar mass form later in lower mass dark matter haloes,
and earlier in massive haloes. We interpret this as a `halo downsizing' effect.

Abstract: In recent studies of methanol masers, a substantial fraction of the objects

that the methanol masers show signs of infall. In this paper we discuss the
dynamics of the Cep A methanol maser and sources from the Torun blind survey to
argue that at least in a fraction of sources methanol masers could be
associated with the shock interface between the large scale accretion,
regulated by the magnetic field, and a 1000-AU scale circumstellar disk. We

Chemical Evolution of Dwarf Irregular and Blue Compact Galaxies","
Abstract: Dwarf irregular and blue compact galaxies are very interesting objects since
they are relatively simple and unevolved. We present new models for the
chemical evolution of these galaxies by assuming different regimes of star
formation (bursting and continuous) and different kinds of galactic winds
(normal and metal-enhanced). Our results show that in order to reproduce all
the properties of these galaxies, including the spread in the chemical
abundances, the star formation should have proceeded in bursts and the number
of bursts should be not larger than 10 in each galaxy, and that metal-enhanced
galactic winds are required. A metal-enhanced wind efficiency increasing with
galactic mass can by itself reproduce the observed mass-metallicity relation
although also an increasing efficiency of star formation and/or number and/or
duration of bursts can equally well reproduce such a relation. Metal enhanced
winds together with an increasing amount of star formation with galactic mass
are required to explain most of the properties of these galaxies. Normal
galactic winds, where all the gas is lost at the same rate, do not reproduce
the features of these galaxies. We suggest that these galaxies should have
suffered a different number of bursts varying from 2 to 10 and that the
efficiency of metal-enhanced winds should have been not too high
($\lambda_{mw}\sim1$). We predict for these galaxies present time Type Ia SN
rates from 0.00084 and 0.0023 per century. Finally, by comparing the abundance
patterns of Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ objects with our models we conclude that they
are very likely the progenitors of the present day dwarf irregulars. (abridged)

Abstract: We present a simple method for fitting parametrized mass models of the Milky

For our choices of parametrization and constraints, we find disc scale lengths

respectively; a Solar radius of 8.29 \pm 0.16 kpc and a circular speed at the

production by solar wind capture is very small today it may have been
significant during the first billion years after planetary formation because
solar wind was much stronger at that time and Earth magnetospheric
configuration may have been different. We estimate that the contribution of
solar wind hydrogen to the Earth water reserves can be up to 10% when we assume
a that the Earth dipole acted as a collector and early solar wind was 1000
times stronger than today. We can not even exclude that solar wind hydrogen was
the main contributor to Earth water reserves.

MHD turbulence-Star Formation Connection: from pc to kpc scales","
Abstract: The transport of magnetic flux to outside of collapsing molecular clouds is a
required step to allow the formation of stars. Although ambipolar diffusion is
often regarded as a key mechanism for that, it has been recently argued that it
may not be efficient enough. In this review, we discuss the role that MHD
turbulence plays in the transport of magnetic flux in star forming flows. In
particular, based on recent advances in the theory of fast magnetic
reconnection in turbulent flows, we will show results of three-dimensional
numerical simulations that indicate that the diffusion of magnetic field
induced by turbulent reconnection can be a very efficient mechanism, especially
in the early stages of cloud collapse and star formation. To conclude, we will
also briefly discuss the turbulence-star formation connection and feedback in
different astrophysical environments: from galactic to cluster of galaxy
scales.

On the source of Faraday rotation in the jet of the radio galaxy 3C120","
Abstract: The source of Faraday rotation in the jet of the radio galaxy 3C120 is
analyzed through Very Long Baseline Array observations carried out between 1999
and 2007 at 86, 43, 22, 15, 12, 8, 5, 2, and 1.7 GHz. Comparison of
observations from 1999 to 2001 reveals uncorrelated changes in the linear
polarization of the underlying jet emission and the Faraday rotation screen:
while the rotation measure (RM) remains constant between approximately 2 and 5
mas from the core, the RM-corrected electric vector position angles (EVPAs) of
two superluminal components are rotated by almost 90 degrees when compared to
other components moving through similar jet locations. On the other hand, the
innermost 2 mas experiences a significant change in RM -- including a sign
reversal -- but without variations in the RM-corrected EVPAs. Similarly,
observations in 2007 reveal a double sign reversal in RM along the jet, while
the RM-corrected EVPAs remain perpendicular to the jet axis. Although the
observed coherent structure and gradient of the RM along the jet supports the
idea that the Faraday rotation is produced by a sheath of thermal electrons
that surrounds the emitting jet, the uncorrelated changes in the RM and
RM-corrected EVPAs indicate that the emitting jet and the source of Faraday
rotation are not closely connected physically and have different configurations
for the magnetic field and/or kinematical properties. Furthermore, the
existence of a region of enhanced RM whose properties remain constant over
three years requires a localized source of Faraday rotation, favoring a model
in which a significant fraction of the RM originates in foreground clouds.

"Title:
The Thermal Instability of Solar Prominence Threads","
Abstract: The fine structure of solar prominences and filaments appears as thin and
long threads in high-resolution images. In H-alpha observations of filaments,
some threads can be observed for only 5 - 20 minutes before they seem to fade
and eventually disappear, suggesting that these threads may have very short
lifetimes. The presence of an instability might be the cause of this quick
disappearance. Here, we study the thermal instability of prominence threads as
an explanation of their sudden disappearance from H-alpha observations. We
model a prominence thread as a magnetic tube with prominence conditions
embedded in a coronal environment. We assume a variation of the physical
properties in the transverse direction, so that the temperature and density
continuously change from internal to external values in an inhomogeneous
transitional layer representing the particular prominence-corona transition
region (PCTR) of the thread. We use the nonadiabatic and resistive
magnetohydrodynamic equations, which include terms due to thermal conduction
parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, radiative losses, heating,
and magnetic diffusion. We combine both analytical and numerical methods to
study linear perturbations from the equilibrium state, focusing on unstable
thermal solutions. We find that thermal modes are unstable in the PCTR for
temperatures higher than 80,000 K, approximately. These modes are related to
temperature disturbances that can lead to changes in the equilibrium due to
rapid plasma heating or cooling. For typical prominence parameters, the
instability time scale is of the order of a few minutes and is independent of
the form of the temperature profile within the PCTR of the thread. This result
indicates that thermal instability may play an important role for the short
lifetimes of threads in the observations.

On the origin of gaseous galaxy halos - Low-column density gas in the  Milky Way halo","
Abstract: Recent observations show that spiral galaxies are surrounded by extended
gaseous halos as predicted by the hierarchical structure formation scenario.
The origin and nature of extraplanar gas is often unclear since the halo is
continuously fueled by different circulation processes as part of the on-going
formation and evolution of galaxies (e.g., outflows, galaxy merging, and gas
accretion from the intergalactic medium). We use the Milky Way as a laboratory
to study neutral and mildly ionised gas located in the inner and outer halo.
Using spectral line absorption and emission measurements in different
wavelength regimes we obtain detailed information on the physical conditions
and the distribution of the gas. Such studies are crucial for our understanding
of the complex interplay between galaxies and their gaseous environment as part
of the formation and evolution of galaxies. Our analysis suggests that the
column-density distribution and physical properties of gas in the Milky Way
halo are very similar to that around other disk galaxies at low and high
redshifts.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the dwarf galaxy IC 10","
Abstract: Infrared observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope archive are used to
study the dust component of the interstellar medium in the IC~10 irregular
galaxy. Dust distribution in the galaxy is compared to the distributions of
H$\alpha$ and [SII] emission, neutral hydrogen and CO clouds, and ionizing
radiation sources. The distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)
in the galaxy is shown to be highly non-uniform with the mass fraction of these
particles in the total dust mass reaching 4%. PAHs tend to avoid bright HII
regions and correlate well with atomic and molecular gas. This pattern suggests
that PAHs form in the dense interstellar gas. We propose that the significant
decrease of the PAH abundance at low metallicity is observed not only globally
(at the level of entire galaxies), but also locally (at least, at the level of
individual HII regions). We compare the distribution of the PAH mass fraction
to the distribution of high-velocity features, that we have detected earlier in
wings of H$\alpha$ and SII lines, over the entire available galaxy area. No
conclusive evidence for shock destruction of PAHs in the IC~10 galaxy could be
found.

these hydrides in diffuse clouds and massive star forming regions of our Galaxy

"Title:
Dust in AGB stars: transparent or opaque?","
Abstract: It is commonly believed that winds of cool giants in their late evolutionary
stages are driven by radiative pressure on dust grains, but the actual grain
species responsible for driving winds of M-type AGB stars are still a matter of
debate (see H\""ofner, this volume). The optical properties of the dust
particles responsible for initiating the outflow affect the stellar spectra in
two ways: (i) indirectly, through their influence on the dynamical structure of
the atmosphere/envelope and the resulting molecular features, and (ii)
directly, by changes of the spectral energy distribution due to absorption and
scattering on dust grains. The qualitative differences in the energy
distributions of C-type and M-type AGB stars in the visual and near-infrared
regions suggest that the dust particles in oxygen rich atmospheres are
relatively transparent to radiation. By using detailed dynamical models of gas
and radiation combined with a simple description for the dust opacity (which
can be adjusted to mimic different wavelength dependencies and condensation
temperatures) and also by adjusting the fraction of the opacity that is treated
as true absorption, we investigate which dust properties produce synthetic
photometry consistent with observations. The goal of this study is to narrow
down the possible dust species that may be driving the winds in M-type AGB
stars.

Polarization observations of 20 millisecond pulsars","
Abstract: Polarization profiles are presented for 20 millisecond pulsars that are being
observed as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project. The observations
used the Parkes multibeam receiver with a central frequency of 1369 MHz and the
Parkes digital filterbank pulsar signal-processing system PDFB2. Because of the
large total observing time, the summed polarization profiles have very high
signal/noise ratios and show many previously undetected profile features.
Thirteen of the 20 pulsars show emission over more than half of the pulse
period. Polarization variations across the profiles are complex and the
observed position angle variations are generally not in accord with the
rotating-vector model for pulsar polarization. Never-the-less, the polarization
properties are broadly similar to those of normal (non-millisecond) pulsars,
suggesting that the basic radio emission mechanism is the same in both classes
of pulsar. The results support the idea that radio emission from millisecond
pulsars originates high in the pulsar magnetosphere, probably close to the
emission regions for high-energy X-ray and gamma-ray emission. Rotation
measures were obtained for all 20 pulsars, eight of which had no previously
published measurements.

Study of gravitational radiation from cosmic domain walls","
Abstract: In this paper, following the previous study, we evaluate the spectrum of
gravitational wave background generated by domain walls which are produced if
some discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken in the early universe. We apply
two different methods to calculate the gravitational wave spectrum: One is to
calculate the gravitational wave spectrum directly from numerical simulations,
and another is to calculate it indirectly by estimating the unequal time
anisotropic stress power spectrum of the scalar field. Both analysises indicate
that the slope of the spectrum changes at two characteristic frequencies
corresponding to the Hubble radius at the decay of domain walls and the width
of domain walls, and that the spectrum between these two characteristic
frequencies becomes flat or slightly red tilted. The second method enables us
to evaluate the GW spectrum semi-analytically for the frequencies which can not
be resolved in the finite box lattice simulations, but relies on the
assumptions for the unequal time correlations of the source.

The Gradients in the 47 Tuc Red Giant Branch Bump and Horizontal Branch  are Consistent With a Centrally-Concentrated, Helium-Enriched Second Stellar  Generation","
Abstract: We combine ground and space-based photometry of the Galactic globular cluster
47 Tuc to measure four independent lines of evidence for a helium gradient in
the cluster, whereby stars in the cluster outskirts would have a lower initial
helium abundance than stars in and near the cluster core. First and second, we
show that the red giant branch bump (RGBB) stars exhibit gradients in their
number counts and brightness. With increased separation from the cluster
center, they become more numerous relative to the other red giant (RG) stars.
They also become fainter. For our third and fourth lines of evidence, we show
that the horizontal branch (HB) of the cluster becomes both fainter and redder
for sightlines farther from the cluster center. These four results are
respectively detected at the 2.3$\sigma$, 3.6$\sigma$, 7.7$\sigma$ and
4.1$\sigma$ levels. Each of these independent lines of evidence is found to be
significant in the cluster-outskirts; closer in, the data are more compatible
with uniform mixing. Our radial profile is qualitatively consistent with but
quantitatively tighter than previous results based on CN absorption. These
observations are qualitatively consistent with a scenario wherein a second
generation of stars with modestly enhanced helium and CNO abundance formed deep
within the gravitational potential of a cluster of previous generation stars
having more canonical abundances.

Kinetic description of quasi-stationary axisymmetric collisionless  accretion disk plasmas with arbitrary magnetic field configurations","
Abstract: A kinetic treatment is developed for collisionless magnetized plasmas
occurring in high-temperature, low-density astrophysical accretion disks, such
as are thought to be present in some radiatively-inefficient accretion flows
onto black holes. Quasi-stationary configurations are investigated, within the
framework of a Vlasov-Maxwell description. The plasma is taken to be
axisymmetric and subject to the action of slowly time-varying gravitational and
electromagnetic fields. The magnetic field is assumed to be characterized by a
family of locally nested but open magnetic surfaces. The slow collisionless
dynamics of these plasmas is investigated, yielding a reduced gyrokinetic
Vlasov equation for the kinetic distribution function. For doing this, an
asymptotic quasi-stationary solution is first determined, represented by a
generalized bi-Maxwellian distribution expressed in terms of the relevant
adiabatic invariants. The existence of the solution is shown to depend on
having suitable kinetic constraints and conditions leading to particle trapping
phenomena. With this solution one can treat temperature anisotropy, toroidal
and poloidal flow velocities and finite Larmor-radius effects. An asymptotic
expansion for the distribution function permits analytic evaluation of all of
the relevant fluid fields. Basic theoretical features of the solution and their
astrophysical implications are discussed. As an application, the possibility of
describing the dynamics of slowly time-varying accretion flows and the
self-generation of magnetic field by means of a \textquotedblleft kinetic
dynamo effect\textquotedblright\ is discussed. Both effects are shown to be
related to intrinsically-kinetic physical mechanisms.

"Title:
Stress-Energy Connection and Cosmological Constant Problem","
Abstract: We study gravitational properties of vacuum energy by erecting a geometry on
the stress-energy tensor of vacuum, matter and radiation. Postulating that the
gravitational effects of matter and radiation can be formulated by an
appropriate modification of the spacetime connection, we obtain varied
geometro-dynamical equations which properly comprise the usual gravitational
field equations with, however, Planck-suppressed, non-local, higher-dimensional
additional terms. The prime novelty brought about by the formalism is that, the
vacuum energy does act not as the cosmological constant but as the source of
the gravitational constant. The formalism thus deafens the cosmological
constant problem by channeling vacuum energy to gravitational constant.
Nevertheless, quantum gravitational effects, if any, restore the problem via
the graviton and graviton-matter loops, and the mechanism proposed here falls
short of taming such contributions to cosmological constant.

postulating the presence of a non luminous non baryonic component. In the
theoretical framework of Newtonian Gravity we recall the properties of Dark
Matter halos as emerging from the state-of-the-art of numerical simulations
performed in the current $\Lambda CDM$ scenario. Then, the simple but
much-telling phenomenology of the distribution of dark and luminous matter in
Spirals, Ellipticals, and dwarf Spheroidals is reported. We show that a
coherent observational framework emerges from reliable data of different large
samples of objects and it is obtained by different methods of investigation. We
then highlight the impressive evidence that the distribution of dark and
luminous matter are closely correlated and that have universal features. Hints
on the cosmological role of this phenomenological scenario are then given.
Finally, we discuss the constraints on the elusive nature of the dark particle
that the actual distribution of DM around galaxies pose on its direct and

Near-infrared jet emission in the microquasar XTE J1550-564","
Abstract: Context: Microquasars are accreting Galactic sources that are also observed
to launch relativistic jets. A key signature of the ejection is non-thermal
radio emission. The level of this jet component at high frequencies is still
poorly constrained. Aims: The X-ray binary and microquasar black hole candidate
XTE J1550-564 exhibited a faint X-ray outburst in April 2003 during which it
stayed in the X-ray low/hard state. We took optical and near-infrared (NIR)
observations with the ESO/NTT telescope during this outburst to disentangle the
various contributions to the spectral energy distribution (SED) and investigate
the presence of a jet component. Methods: Photometric and spectroscopic
observations allowed us to construct an SED and also to produce a high
time-resolution lightcurve. Results: The SED shows an abrupt change of slope
from the NIR domain to the optical. The NIR emission is attributed to
non-thermal synchrotron emission from the compact, self-absorbed jet that is
known to be present in the low/hard state. This is corroborated by the fast
variability, colours, lack of prominent spectral features and evidence for
intrinsic polarisation. The SED suggests the jet break from the optically thick
to the thin regime occurs in the NIR. Conclusions: The simultaneous optical-NIR
data allow an independent confirmation of jet emission in the NIR. The
transition to optically thin synchrotron occurs at NIR frequencies or below,
which leads to an estimated characteristic size greater than 2x10^8cm and
magnetic field less than 5T for the jet base, assuming a homogeneous one-zone

differences away from the north-west relic edge such that the low-frequency

the origin of the relic emission. New X-ray data from XMM-Newton reveal
interesting structures in the intracluster medium pressure, entropy and

On the inversion of Stokes profiles with local stray-light contamination","
Abstract: Obtaining the magnetic properties of non-resolved structures in the solar

carried out through the numerical minimization of a merit function that depends
on the proposed model. We investigate the reliability of inversions in which
the stray-light contamination is obtained from the same observations as a local
average. In this case, we show that it is fundamental to include the covariance
between the observed Stokes profiles and the stray-light contamination. The
ensuing modified merit function of the inversion process penalizes large
stray-light contaminations simply because of the presence of positive
correlations between the observables and the stray-light, fundamentally
produced by spatially variable systematics. We caution that using the wrong
merit function, artificially large stray-light contaminations might be
inferred. Since this effect disappears if the stray-light contamination is
obtained as an average over the full field-of-view, we recommend to take into
account stray-light contamination using a global approach.

Approximations for modelling CO chemistry in GMCs: a comparison of  approaches","
Abstract: We examine several different simplified approaches for modelling the
chemistry of CO in three-dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent
molecular clouds. We compare the different models both by looking at the
behaviour of integrated quantities such as the mean CO fraction or the
cloud-averaged CO-to-H2 conversion factor, and also by studying the detailed
distribution of CO as a function of gas density and visual extinction. In
addition, we examine the extent to which the density and temperature
distributions depend on our choice of chemical model.
We find that all of the models predict the same density PDF and also agree
very well on the form of the temperature PDF for temperatures T > 30 K,
although at lower temperatures, some differences become apparent. All of the
models also predict the same CO-to-H2 conversion factor, to within a factor of
a few. However, when we look more closely at the details of the CO
distribution, we find larger differences. The more complex models tend to
produce less CO and more atomic carbon than the simpler models, suggesting that
the C/CO ratio may be a useful observational tool for determining which model
best fits the observational data. Nevertheless, the fact that these chemical
differences do not appear to have a strong effect on the density or temperature
distributions of the gas suggests that the dynamical behaviour of the molecular
clouds on large scales is not particularly sensitive to how accurately the
small-scale chemistry is modelled.

Violent mergers of nearly equal-mass white dwarf as progenitors of  subluminous Type Ia supernovae","
Abstract: The origin of subluminous Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has long eluded any
explanation, as all Chandrasekhar-mass models have severe problems reproducing
them. Recently, it has been proposed that violent mergers of two white dwarfs
of 0.9 M_sun could lead to subluminous SNe Ia events that resemble 1991bg-like
SNe~Ia. Here we investigate whether this scenario still works for mergers of
two white dwarfs with a mass ratio smaller than one. We aim to determine the
range of mass ratios for which a detonation still forms during the merger, as
only those events will lead to a SN Ia. This range is an important ingredient
for population synthesis and one decisive point to judge the viability of the
scenario. In addition, we perform a resolution study of one of the models.
Finally we discuss the connection between violent white dwarf mergers with a
primary mass of 0.9 M_sun and 1991bg-like SNe Ia. The latest version of the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics code Gadget3 is used to evolve binary systems
with different mass ratios until they merge. We analyze the result and look for
hot spots in which detonations can form. We show that mergers of two white
dwarfs with a primary white dwarf mass of ~0.9 M_sun and a mass ratio larger
than about $0.8$ robustly reach the conditions we require to ignite a

We also find that while our simulations do not yet completely resolve the hot

to ignite detonations. (abridged)

"Title:
Current assessment of the Red Rectangle band problem","
Abstract: In this paper we discuss our insights into several key problems in the
identification of the Red Rectangle Bands (RRBs). We have combined three
independent sets of observations in order to try to define the constraints
guiding the bands. We provide a summary of the general behavior of the bands
and review the evidence for a molecular origin of the bands. The extent,
composition, and possible absorption effects of the bands are discussed.
Comparison spectra of the strongest band obtained at three different spectral
resolutions suggests that an intrinsic line width of individual rotational
lines can be deduced. Spectroscopic models of several relatively simple
molecules were examined in order to investigate where the current data are
weak. Suggestions are made for future studies to enhance our understanding of
these enigmatic bands.

Robustness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism","
Abstract: The Blandford-Znajek mechanism has long been regarded as a key ingredient in

mechanism robustness upon variation of these conditions. Consequently, this

Binary Evolution Constraints from Luminosity Functions of LMXBs","
Abstract: The formation and evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) is not well
understood. The properties of a population of LMXBs depend on a number of
uncertain aspects of binary evolution, and population studies offers a
relatively new way of probing binary interactions. We have studied the shape of
the faint end of the X-ray luminosity function (LF) of LMXBs in nearby galaxies

clear difference between the LF of LMXBs in globular clusters (GCs) and those
outside, with a relative lack of faint GC sources. This indicates a difference
in the composition of the two populations.

The Evolution of Stellar Populations in the Outer Disks of Spiral  Galaxies","
Abstract: We investigate recent star formation in the extended ultraviolet (XUV) disks
of five nearby galaxies (NGC 0628, NGC 2090, NGC 2841, NGC 3621, and NGC 5055)
using a long wavelength baseline comprised of ultraviolet and mid-infrared
imaging from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the Spitzer Infrared Array
Camera. We identify 229 unresolved stellar complexes across targeted portions
of their XUV disks and utilize spectral energy distribution fitting to measure
their stellar ages and masses through comparison with Starburst99 population
synthesis models of instantaneous burst populations. We find that the median
age of outer disk associations in our sample is ~100 Myr with a large
dispersion that spans the entire range of our models (1 Myr-1 Gyr). This
relatively evolved state for most associations addresses the observed dearth of
Halpha emission in some outer disks, as Halpha can only be observed in star
forming regions younger than ~10 Myr. The large age dispersion is robust
against variations in extinction (in the range E(B-V)=0-0.3 mag) and variations
in the upper end of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF). In particular, we
demonstrate that the age dispersion is insensitive to steepening of the IMF, up
to extreme slopes.

Four-fermion interaction from torsion as dark energy","
Abstract: The observed small, positive cosmological constant may originate from a
four-fermion interaction generated by the spin-torsion coupling in the
Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble gravity if the fermions are condensing. In
particular, such a condensation occurs for quark fields during the
quark-gluon/hadron phase transition in the early Universe. We study how the
torsion-induced four-fermion interaction is affected by adding two terms to the
Dirac Lagrangian density: the parity-violating pseudoscalar density dual to the
curvature tensor and a spinor-bilinear scalar density which measures the
nonminimal coupling of fermions to torsion.

"Title:
The Capra Research Program for Modelling Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals","
Abstract: Suppose a small compact object (black hole or neutron star) of mass $m$
orbits a large black hole of mass $M \gg m$. This system emits gravitational
waves (GWs) that have a radiation-reaction effect on the particle's motion.
EMRIs (extreme--mass-ratio inspirals) of this type will be important GW sources
for LISA; LISA's data analysis will require highly accurate EMRI GW templates.
In this article I outline the ""Capra"" research program to try to model EMRIs
and calculate their GWs \textit{ab initio}, assuming only that $m \ll M$ and
that the Einstein equations hold. Here we treat the EMRI spacetime as a
perturbation of the large black hole's ""background"" (Schwarzschild or Kerr)
spacetime and use the methods of black-hole perturbation theory, expanding in
the small parameter $m/M$. The small body's motion can be described either as
the result of a radiation-reaction ""self-force"" acting in the background
spacetime or as geodesic motion in a perturbed spacetime. Several different
lines of reasoning lead to the (same) basic $\O(m/M)$ ""MiSaTaQuWa"" equations of
motion for the particle. Surprisingly, for a nonlinear field theory such as
general relativity, modelling the small body as a point particle works well.
The particle's own field is singular along the particle worldline so it's
difficult to formulate a meaningful ""perturbation"" theory or equations of
motion there. I discuss ""mode-sum"" and ""puncture-function"" regularization
schemes that resolve this difficulty and allow practical self-force
calculations, and I outline an important recent calculation of this type.
Most Capra research to date has used 1st order perturbation theory. To obtain
the very high accuracies needed to fully exploit LISA's observations of the
strongest EMRIs, 2nd order perturbation theory will probably be needed.

Discovery of two millisecond pulsars in Fermi sources with the Nancay  Radio Telescope","
Abstract: We report the discovery of two millisecond pulsars in a search for radio
pulsations at the positions of \emph{Fermi Large Area Telescope} sources with
no previously known counterparts, using the Nan\c{c}ay radio telescope. The two
millisecond pulsars, PSRs J2017+0603 and J2302+4442, have rotational periods of
2.896 and 5.192 ms and are both in binary systems with low-eccentricity orbits
and orbital periods of 2.2 and 125.9 days respectively, suggesting long
recycling processes. Gamma-ray pulsations were subsequently detected for both
objects, indicating that they power the associated \emph{Fermi} sources in
which they were found. The gamma-ray light curves and spectral properties are
similar to those of previously-detected gamma-ray millisecond pulsars. Detailed
modeling of the observed radio and gamma-ray light curves shows that the
gamma-ray emission seems to originate at high altitudes in their
magnetospheres. Additionally, X-ray observations revealed the presence of an
X-ray source at the position of PSR J2302+4442, consistent with thermal
emission from a neutron star. These discoveries along with the numerous
detections of radio-loud millisecond pulsars in gamma rays suggest that many
\emph{Fermi} sources with no known counterpart could be unknown millisecond
pulsars.

Cosmologically it may play a role in explaining why the energy density has the

cosmological constant has the value as observed. Astrophysically the physics of
spacetime foam helps to elucidate why the critical acceleration in modified
Newtonian dynamics has the observed value; and it provides a possible

phenomenon of flat rotation curves of galaxies and the observed Tully-Fisher
relation. Spacetime foam physics also sheds light on nonlocal gravitational

Distribution and excitation of thermal methanol in 6.7 GHz maser bearing  star-forming regions; I. The nearby source Cepheus A","
Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the distribution and excitation of
the methanol gas around Cep A and to describe the physical conditions of the
region. In addition the large scale abundance distribution is determined in
order to understand the morphology and kinematics of star forming regions in
which methanol masers occur. The spatial distribution of the methanol is
studied by mapping line emission, as well as the column density and excitation
temperature, which are estimated using rotation diagrams. For a limited number
of positions the parameters are checked with non-LTE models. Furthermore, the
distribution of the methanol abundance is derived in comparison with archival
dust continuum maps. Methanol is detected over a 0.3x0.15 pc area centred on
the Cep A HW2 source, showing an outflow signature. Most of the gas can be
characterized by a moderately warm rotation temperature (30-60K). At the
central position two velocity components are detected with different excitation
characteristics, the first related to the large-scale outflow. The second
component, uniquely detected at the central location, is probably associated
with the maser emission on much smaller scales of 2"". Detailed analysis reveals
that the highest densities and temperatures occur for these inner components.
In the inner region the dust and gas are shown to have different physical
parameters. Abundances of methanol in the range 10E-9 - 10E-7 are inferred,
with the abundance peaking at the maser position. The geometry of the
large-scale methanol is in accordance with previous determinations of the Cep A
geometry, in particular those from methanol masers. The dynamical and chemical
time-scales are consistent with the methanol originating from a single driving
source associated with the HW2 object and the masers in its equatorial region.

A Closely-Packed System of Low-Mass, Low-Density Planets Transiting  Kepler-11","
Abstract: When an extrasolar planet passes in front of its star (transits), its radius
can be measured from the decrease in starlight and its orbital period from the
time between transits. Multiple planets transiting the same star reveal more:
period ratios determine stability and dynamics, mutual gravitational
interactions reflect planet masses and orbital shapes, and the fraction of
transiting planets observed as multiples has implications for the planarity of
planetary systems. But few stars have more than one known transiting planet,
and none has more than three. Here we report Kepler spacecraft observations of
a single Sun-like star that reveal six transiting planets, five with orbital
periods between 10 and 47 days plus a sixth one with a longer period. The five
inner planets are among the smallest whose masses and sizes have both been
measured, and these measurements imply substantial envelopes of light gases.
The degree of coplanarity and proximity of the planetary orbits imply energy
dissipation near the end of planet formation.

Measuring the cosmological bulk flow using the peculiar velocities of  supernovae","
Abstract: We study large-scale coherent motion in our universe using the existing Type
IA supernovae data. If the recently observed bulk flow is real, then some
imprint must be left on supernovae motion. We run a series of Monte Carlo
Markov Chain runs in various redshift bins and find a sharp contrast between
the z < 0.05 and z > 0.05 data. The$z < 0.05 data are consistent with the bulk
flow in the direction (l,b)=({290^{+39}_{-31}}^{\circ},
{20^{+32}_{-32}}^{\circ}) with a magnitude of v_bulk = 188^{+119}_{-103} km/s

hypothesis) is 95%. In contrast, z > 0.05 data (which contains 425 of the 557

direction of the bulk flow agrees very well with previous studies, the
magnitude is significantly smaller. For example, the Kashlinsky, et al.'s
original bulk flow result of v_bulk > 600 km/s is inconsistent with our
analysis at greater than 99.7% confidence level. Furthermore, our best-fit bulk
flow velocity is consistent with the expectation for the \Lambda CDM model,

Observational constraints on the spin of the most massive black holes  from radio observations","
Abstract: We use recent progress in simulating the production of magnetohydrodynamic
jets around black holes to derive the cosmic spin history of the most massive
black holes, with masses >~10^8 Msol. Assuming the jet efficiency depends on
spin a, we can approximately reproduce the observed `radio loudness' of quasars
and the local radio luminosity function. Using the X-ray luminosity function
and the local mass function of supermassive black holes, SMBHs we can reproduce
the individual radio luminosity functions of radio sources showing high- and
low-excitation narrow emission lines. The data favour spin distributions that
are bimodal, with one component around spin zero and the other close to maximal
spin. In the low-excitation galaxies, the two components have similar
amplitudes. For the high-excitation galaxies, the amplitude of the high-spin
peak is typically much smaller than that of the low-spin peak. A bimodality
should be seen in the radio loudness of quasars. We predict that the
low-excitation galaxies are dominated by SMBHs with masses >~10^8 Msol, down to
radio luminosity densities ~10^21 W Hz-1 sr-1 at 1.4~GHz. Our model is also
able to predict the radio luminosity function at z=1, and predicts it to be
dominated by high-excitation galaxies above luminosity densities >~10^26 W Hz-1
sr-1, in full agreement with the observations. From our parametrisation and
using the best fitting jet efficiencies there is marginal evidence for
evolution in spin: the mean spin increases slightly from <a>~0.25 at z=1 to
<a>~0.35 at z=0, and the fraction of SMBHs with a>=0.5 increases from
0.16+-0.03 at z=1 to 0.24+-0.09 at z=0. Our results are in excellent agreement
with the mean radiative efficiency of quasars, as well as recent cosmological
simulations. We discuss the implications in terms of accretion and SMBH

J0948+0022, i.e., its flux density and structure in total intensity and in
polarization, its compactness, and variability. We performed three real-time
e-VLBI observations of PMN J0948+0022 at 22 GHz, using a global array including
telescopes in Europe, East Asia, and Australia. These are the first e-VLBI
science observations ever carried out with a global array, reaching a maximum
baseline length of 12458 km. The observations were part of a large
multiwavelength campaign in 2009. The source is detected at all three epochs.
The structure is dominated by a bright component, more compact than 55
microarcsec, with a fainter component at a position angle theta~ 35deg.
Relativistic beaming is required by the observed brightness temperature of
3.4x10^11 K. Polarization is detected at a level of about 1%. The parameters
derived by the VLBI observations, in addition to the broad-band properties,
confirm that PMN J0948+0022 is similar to flat spectrum radio quasars. Global

The Swift Serendipitous Survey in deep XRT GRB fields (SwiftFT) I. The  X-ray catalog and number counts","
Abstract: We searched for X-ray serendipitous sources in over 370 Swift-XRT fields
centered on gamma ray bursts detected between 2004 and 2008 and observed with
total exposures ranging from 10 ks to over 1 Ms. This defines the Swift
Serendipitous Survey in deep XRT GRB fields, which is quite broad compared to
existing surveys (~33 square degrees) and medium depth, with a faintest flux
limit of 7.2e-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.5 to 2 keV energy range. The survey
has a high degree of uniformity thanks to the stable point spread function and
small vignetting correction factors of the XRT, moreover is completely random
on the sky as GRBs explode in totally unrelated parts of the sky. In this paper
we present the sample and the X-ray number counts of the high Galactic-latitude
sample, estimated with high statistics over a wide flux range (i.e., 7.2e-16 to
~5e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.5-2 keV band and 3.4e-15 to ~6e-13 erg cm^-2
s^-1 in the 2-10 keV band). We detect 9387 point-like sources, while 7071
point-like sources are found at high Galactic-latitudes (i.e. >=20 deg). The
large number of detected sources resulting from the combination of large area
and deep flux limits make this survey a new important tool for investigating
the evolution of AGN. In particular, the large area permits finding rare
high-luminosity objects like QSO2, which are poorly sampled by other surveys,
adding precious information for the luminosity function bright end. The high
Galactic-latitude logN-logS relation is well determined over all the flux
coverage, and it is nicely consistent with previous results at 1 sigma
confidence level. By the hard X-ray color analysis, we find that the Swift
Serendipitous Survey in deep XRT GRB fields samples relatively unobscured and
mildly obscured AGN, with a fraction of obscured sources of ~37% (~15%) in the
2-10 (0.3-3 keV) band.

from the study of the evolution of the mass-to-light ratios of satellites that
show a disrupted phase it has been found that it is possible that some dSph
galaxies of the Milky Way with large M/L ratios might not be dark matter
dominated and that their high mass to light ratios are observed because they

strong enough to drive them to coalescence. Such coalescences will be important
sources of GWs for future space-borne detectors such as the {\it Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna} (LISA). Based on our results, we expect that LISA

Abstract: 8.4-GHZ radio imaging study of an optically selected sample of early type

variation in the nuclear radio flux density in five of them over a seven year
period. It is shown that there is a possible correlation between the presence
of nuclear radio variability and the absence of hundred parsec-scale radio
emission, analogous with radio-loud AGN. Our results suggest that all Seyferts
may exhibit variation in their nuclear radio flux density at 8.4 GHz, but that
variability is more easily recognized in compact sources in which emission from
the variable nucleus is not diluted by unresolved, constant flux density radio
jet emission within the central 50 pc. Taken in combination with other Seyfert
properties, these results suggest a paradigm of intermittent periods of
quiescence and nuclear outburst across the Seyfert population and demonstrate
the importance of investigating the temporal domain at radio wavelengths, which
remains completely unexplored for faint radio-quiet AGN. Discovery of
intermittent activity and radio flares has important implications for the AGN
duty cycles and the origin of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays. New radio
facilities, such as the EVLA/VLBA, eMERLIN, LOFAR and eVLBI on the EVN, will

Probing Turbulence in the Interstellar Medium using  Radio-Interferometric Observations of Neutral Hydrogen","
Abstract: We develop a visibility based power spectrum estimator to probe the power
spectrum directly from the interferometric observations and also estimate the
errors in it. A numerical simulation of synthetic observations is also
performed to access the efficacy and limitations of this estimator. We use this
estimator to evaluate the power spectrum of three individual spiral galaxies, a
dwarf galaxy sample and THINGS * spiral galaxies. In each case, the power
spectrum is found to follow a power law PHI (U) = AU {\alpha} over a specific
length scale range. The estimated value for the slope {\alpha} ranges from ~
~1.5 to ~ -2.6 for the sample of dwarf galaxies. We interpret this bi-modality
as arising due to 2D turbulence on length scales much larger than the
scale-height of the galaxy disk and 3D otherwise. The power law slope also show
a weak correlation with the surface density of star formation rate for these
galaxies. We found for the external spiral galaxies the power spectrum is a
power law up to a length scale of 10 to 16 kpc, indicating turbulence to be
operational at these large length scales. We measure the scale-height of the
external nearly face-on spiral galaxy NGC 1058 to be ~ 500 pc interpreting a
change in the slope observed in it's power spectrum. Power spectrum of the
harassed galaxy NGC 4254 is found to be affected by galaxy harassment. For 18
spiral galaxies derived from the THINGS sample we found no correlation between
the power law slope and the different dynamical parameters of these galaxies.
For most of the dwarf and spiral galaxies, the intensity fluctuation power
spectrum is found to be a direct probe of the density fluctuation and not
affected by the velocity fluctuations in ISM. We would attempt to understand
these new observations in terms of physical models of the ISM in future.

On the effects of rotation on acoustic stellar pulsations: validity  domains of perturbative methods and close frequency pairs","
Abstract: Pulsation frequencies of acoustic modes are calculated for realistic rotating
stellar models using both a perturbative and a two-dimensional approach. A
comparison between the two yields validity domains which are similar to those
previously obtained in Reese, Lignieres and Rieutord (2006) for polytropic
models. One can also construct validity domains based on polynomial fits to the
frequencies from the two-dimensional approach, and these also turn out to be
similar, thus further confirming the agreement between the perturbative and
two-dimensional approach at low rotation rates. Furthermore, as was previously
shown in Espinosa, Perez Hernandez and Roca Cortes (2004), adjacent frequencies
in multiplets come close together, thus forming pairs. This phenomena,
exclusive to two-dimensional calculations, is shown to be an unlikely
explanation of the close frequency pairs observed in delta Scuti stars. A
systematic search for all close frequency pairs in the calculated spectrum is
also carried out. The number of close frequency pairs is shown to agree with
what is expected based on a Poisson distribution, but does not match the number
or distribution of close pairs in stars like FG Vir. Furthermore, a lack of
close frequency pairs appears at low rotation rates, where frequency multiplets
do not overlap. Delta Scuti stars currently reported as having close frequency
pairs do not fall in this interval.

A Sino-German 6cm polarization survey of the Galactic plane IV. The  region from 60deg to 129deg longitude","
Abstract: Linear polarization of diffuse Galactic emission is a signature of magnetic
fields in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy. Observations at high
frequencies are less affected by Faraday depolarization than those at lower

Galactic regions. We attempt to perform a sensitive survey of the polarized
emission from the Galactic disk at 6 cm wavelength. We made polarization
observations of the Galactic plane using the Urumqi 25-m telescope at 6 cm
covering the area of 60deg< l <129deg and |b|<5deg. Missing large-scale
structures in polarization were restored by extrapolation of the WMAP
polarization data. We present the 6cm total intensity and linear polarization
maps of the surveyed region. We identify two new extended HII regions G98.3-1.6
and G119.6+0.4 in this region. Numerous polarized patches and depolarization
structures are visible in the polarization maps. Depolarization along the
periphery of a few HII complexes was detected and can be explained by a Faraday
screen model. We discuss some prominent depolarization HII regions, which have
regular magnetic fields of several $\mu$G. Structure functions of U, Q and PI
images of the entire 6cm survey region of 10deg< l < 230deg exhibit much larger

"Title:
Radial Velocity Survey of Low-Mass Companions to sdB Stars","
Abstract: The origin of subdwarf B (sdB) stars is not fully understood yet since it
requires high mass loss at the red giant stage. SdBs in close binary systems
are formed via common envelope ejection, but the origin of apparently single
sdB stars remains unclear. Substellar companions may be able to trigger common
envelope ejection and help forming sdBs that appear to be single. Using a
sample of high resolution spectra we aim at detecting small radial velocity
(RV) shifts caused by such low mass (sub-)stellar companions. The RVs are
measured with high accuracy using sharp metal lines. Our goal is to test the
theoretical predictions and put constraints on the population of the lowest
mass companions to sdB stars.

The other side of Bulge Formation in a Lambda-CDM cosmology: Bulgeless  Galaxies in the Local Universe","
Abstract: We study the physical properties, formation histories, and environment of
galaxies without a significant ""classical"" spheroidal component, as predicted
by semi-analytical models of galaxy formation and evolution. This work is
complementary to the analysis presented in De Lucia et al., (2011), where we
focus on the relative contribution of various physical mechanisms responsible
for bulge assembly in a Lambda-CDM cosmology. We find that the fraction of
bulgeless galaxies is a strong decreasing function of stellar mass: they
represent a negligible fraction of the galaxy population with M* > 10^12 Msun,
but dominate at M* < 10^10 Msun. We find a clear dichotomy in this galaxy
population, between central galaxies of low-mass dark matter haloes, and
satellite galaxies in massive groups/clusters. We show that bulgeless galaxies
are relatively young systems, that assemble most of their mass at low-redshift,
but they can also host very old stellar populations. Since galaxy-galaxy
mergers are assumed to lead to the formation of a spheroidal component, in our
models these galaxies form preferentially in low-mass haloes that host a small
number of satellites galaxies. We show that the adopted modelling for galaxy
mergers represents a key ingredient in determining the actual number of
bulgeless galaxies. Our results show that these galaxies are not a rare
population in theoretical models: at z~0, galaxies with no classical bulge (but
often including galaxies with the equivalent of pseudo-bulges) account for up
to 14% of the galaxies with 10^11 < M*/Msun < 10^12.

The 2009 outburst of accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17511-3057 as  observed by SWIFT and RXTE","
Abstract: The twelfth accretion-powered millisecond pulsar, IGR J17511-3057, was
discovered in September 2009. In this work we study its spectral and timing
properties during the 2009 outburst based on Swift and RXTE data. Our spectral
analysis of the source indicates only slight spectral shape evolution during
the entire outburst. The equivalent width of the iron line and the apparent
area of the blackbody emission associated with the hotspot at the stellar
surface both decrease significantly during the outburst. This is consistent
with a gradual receding of the accretion disc as the accretion rate drops. The
pulse profile analysis shows absence of dramatic shape evolution with a
moderate decrease in pulse amplitude. This behaviour might result from a
movement of the accretion column footprint towards the magnetic pole as the
disc retreats. The time lag between the soft and the hard energy pulses
increase by a factor of two during the outburst. A physical displacement of the
centroid of the accretion shock relative to the blackbody spot or changes in
the emissivity pattern of the Comptonization component related to the
variations of the accretion column structure could cause this evolution. We
have found that IGR J17511-3057 demonstrates outburst stages similar to those
seen in SAX J1808.4-3658. A transition from the ""slow decay"" into the ""rapid
drop"" stage, associated with the dramatic flux decrease, is also accompanied by
a pulse phase shift which could result from an appearance of the secondary spot
due to the increasing inner disc radius.

Planets around Extreme Horizontal Branch Stars","
Abstract: We review three main results of our recent study:
We show that a proper treatment of the tidal interaction prior to the onset
of the common envelope (CE) leads to an enhance mass loss. This might increase
the survivability of planets and brown dwarfs that enter a CE phase.
From the distribution of planets around main sequence stars, we conclude that
around many sdB/sdO stars more than one planet might be present. One of these
might have a close orbit and the others at about orbital periods of years or
more.
We show that the intense ionizing flux of the extreme horizontal branch star
might evaporate large quantities of a very close surviving substellar object.
Balmer emission lines from the evaporated gas can be detected via their Doppler
shifts.

"Title:
Observed Binary Fraction Sets Limits on the Extent of Collisional  Grinding in the Kuiper Belt","
Abstract: The size distribution in the cold classical Kuiper belt can be approximated
by two idealized power laws: one with steep slope for radii R>R* and one with
shallow slope for R<R*, where R*~25-50 km. Previous works suggested that the
SFD roll-over at R* can be the result of extensive collisional grinding in the
Kuiper belt that led to the catastrophic disruption of most bodies with R<R*.
Here we use a new code to test the effect of collisions in the Kuiper belt. We
find that the observed roll-over could indeed be explained by collisional
grinding provided that the initial mass in large bodies was much larger than
the one in the present Kuiper belt, and was dynamically depleted. In addition
to the size distribution changes, our code also tracks the effects of
collisions on binary systems. We find that it is generally easier to dissolve
wide binary systems, such as the ones existing in the cold Kuiper belt today,
than to catastrophically disrupt objects with R~R*. Thus, the binary survival
sets important limits on the extent of collisional grinding in the Kuiper belt.
We find that the extensive collisional grinding required to produce the SFD
roll-over at R* would imply a strong gradient of the binary fraction with R and
separation, because it is generally easier to dissolve binaries with small
components and/or those with wide orbits. The expected binary fraction for R<R*
is <0.1. The present observational data do not show such a gradient. Instead,
they suggest a large binary fraction of ~0.4 for R=30-40 km. This may indicate
that the roll-over was not produced by disruptive collisions, but is instead a
fossil remnant of the KBO formation process.

Global stellar variability study in the field-of-view of the Kepler  satellite","
Abstract: We present the results of an automated variability analysis of the Kepler
public data measured in the first quarter (Q1) of the mission. In total, about
150 000 light curves have been analysed to detect stellar variability, and to
identify new members of known variability classes. We also focus on the
detection of variables present in eclipsing binary systems, given the important
constraints on stellar fundamental parameters they can provide. The methodology
we use here is based on the automated variability classification pipeline which
was previously developed for and applied successfully to the CoRoT exofield
database and to the limited subset of a few thousand Kepler asteroseismology
light curves. We use a Fourier decomposition of the light curves to describe
their variability behaviour and use the resulting parameters to perform a
supervised classification. Several improvements have been made, including a
separate extractor method to detect the presence of eclipses when other
variability is present in the light curves. We also included two new
variability classes compared to previous work: variables showing signs of
rotational modulation and of activity. Statistics are given on the number of
variables and the number of good candidates per class. A comparison is made
with results obtained for the CoRoT exoplanet data. We present some special
discoveries, including variable stars in eclipsing binary systems. Many new
candidate non-radial pulsators are found, mainly Delta Sct and Gamma Dor stars.

"Title:
The Evolution of Cataclysmic Variables as Revealed by their Donor Stars","
Abstract: We reconstruct the evolutionary path followed by cataclysmic variables (CVs)
from the observed mass-radius relationship of their donor stars. Along the way,
we update the semi-empirical CV donor sequence of Knigge (2006) and present a
comprehensive review of the link between CV evolution and donor physics. After
calibrating state-of-the art stellar models for use in the CV setting, we fit
self-consistent theoretical evolution sequences to the observed donor masses
and radii. In the standard model of CV evolution, AML below the period gap is
assumed to be driven solely by gravitational radiation (GR), while AML above
the gap is usually described by a magnetic braking prescription due to
Rappaport, Verbunt & Joss (1983). We find that simple scaled versions of these
recipes match the data quite well. However, the optimal scaling factors turn
out to be f_GR = 2.47 +/- 0.22 below the gap and f_MB = 0.66 +/- 0.05 above.
The implications and applications of our results include: (1) The revised
evolution sequence yields correct locations for the CV minimum period and the
upper edge of the period gap; the standard sequence does not. (2) A comparison
of predicted and observed WD temperatures suggests an even higher value for
f_GR, but this is sensitive to the assumed WD mass. (3) The absolute donor
magnitudes predicted by our sequences can be used to set firm lower limits on
the distances toward CVs. (4) Both standard and revised sequences predict that
short-period CVs should be susceptible to dwarf nova (DN) eruptions, consistent
with observations. However, both sequences also predict that the DNe fraction
among long-period CVs should decline with P_orb. Observations suggest the
opposite behaviour. (5) The ratio of long-period CVs to short-period,
pre-bounce CV is about 3x higher for the revised sequence than the standard
one. This may resolve a long-standing problem in CV evolution. [abridged]

Instead, we describe a creative solution that provides excellent performance

Abstract: A radio study of a carefully selected sample of 20 Seyfert galaxies that are

active galactic nuclei (AGN) power and host galaxy properties is presented to
test the predictions of the unified scheme hypothesis. Our sample sources have
core flux densities greater than 8 mJy at 5 GHz on arcsec-scales due to the
feasibility requirements. These simultaneous pc-scale and kpc-scale radio
observations reveal (i) that Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies have equal
tendency to show compact radio structures on mas-scales, (ii) the distributions
of pc-scale and kpc-scale radio luminosities are similar for both Seyfert 1 and
Seyfert 2 galaxies, (iii) no evidence for relativistic beaming in Seyfert
galaxies, (iv) similar distributions of source spectral indices in spite of the
fact that Seyferts show nuclear radio flux density variations, and (v) the
distributions of projected linear size for Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies are
not significantly different as would be expected in the unified scheme. The
latter could be mainly due to a relatively large spread in the intrinsic sizes.
We also find that a starburst alone cannot power these radio sources. Finally,
an analysis of the kpc-scale radio properties of the CfA Seyfert galaxy sample
shows results consistent with the predictions of the unified scheme.

Atomic Hydrogen produced in M33 Photodissociation Regions","
Abstract: We derive total (atomic + molecular) hydrogen densities in giant molecular
clouds (GMCs) in the nearby spiral galaxy M33 using a method that views the
atomic hydrogen near regions of recent star formation as the product of
photodissociation. Far-UV photons emanating from a nearby OB association
produce a layer of atomic hydrogen on the surfaces of nearby GMCs. Our approach
provides an estimate of the total hydrogen density in these GMCs from
observations of the excess far-UV emission that reaches the GMC from the OB
association, and the excess 21-cm radio HI emission produced after these far-UV
photons convert H2 into HI on the GMC surface. The method provides an
alternative approach to the use of CO emission as a tracer of H2 in GMCs, and
is especially sensitive to a range of density well below the critical density
for CO(1-0) emission. We describe our ""PDR method"" in more detail and apply it
using GALEX far-UV and VLA 21-cm radio data to obtain volume densities in a
selection of GMCs in the nearby spiral galaxy M33. We have also examined the
sensitivity of the method to the linear resolution of the observations used;
the results obtained at 20 pc are similar to those for the larger set of data
at 80 pc resolution. The cloud densities we derive range from 1 to 500 cm-3,
with no clear dependence on galactocentric radius; these results are generally
similar to those obtained earlier in M81, M83, and M101 using the same method.

The Real Gauge Singlet Scalar Extension of Standard Model: A Possible  Candidate of Cold Dark Matter","
Abstract: We consider a simplest extension of Standard Model in which a real SM gauge
singlet scalar with an additional discrete symmetry $Z_2$ is introduced to SM.
This additional scalar can be a viable candidate of cold dark matter since the
stability of $S$ is achieved by the application of $Z_2$ symmetry on $S$.
Considering $S$ as a possible candidate of cold dark matter we have solved
Boltzmann's equation to find the freeze out temperature and relic density of
$S$ for Higgs mass 120 GeV in the scalar mass range 5 GeV to 1 TeV. As $HHSS$
coupling $\delta_2$ appearing in Lagrangian depends upon the value of scalar
mass $m_S$ and Higgs mass $m_h$, we have constrained the $m_S - \delta_2$
parameter space by using the WMAP limit on the relic density of dark matter in
the universe and the results of recent ongoing dark matter direct search
experiments namely CDMS-II, CoGeNT, DAMA, EDELWEISS-II, XENON-10, XENON-100.
From such analysis we find two distinct mass regions (a lower and higher mass
domain) for such a dark matter candidate that satisfy both the WMAP limit and
the experimental results considered here. We have estimated the possible
differential direct detection rates and annual variation of total detection
rates for this scalar dark matter candidate $S$ for two detector materials
namely Ge, Xe. Finally we have calculated the $\gamma-$ray flux from the
galactic centre due to annihilation of two 130 GeV scalar dark matter into two
monoenergetic $\gamma-$rays.

"Title:
Interpreting large-scale redshift-space distortion measurements","
Abstract: The simplest theory describing large-scale redshift-space distortions (RSD),
based on linear theory and distant galaxies, depends on the growth of
cosmological structure, suggesting that strong tests of General Relativity can
be constructed from galaxy surveys. As data sets become larger and the expected
constraints more precise, the extent to which the RSD follow the simple theory
needs to be assessed in order that we do not introduce systematic errors into
the tests by introducing inaccurate simplifying assumptions. We study the
impact of the sample geometry, non-linear processes, and biases induced by our
lack of understanding of the radial galaxy distribution on RSD measurements.
Using LasDamas simulations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II)
Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data, these effects are shown to be important at the
level of 20 per cent. Including them, we can accurately model the recovered
clustering in these mock catalogues on scales 30 -- 200 Mpc/h. Applying this
analysis to robustly measure parameters describing the growth history of the
Universe from the SDSS-II data, gives
$f(z=0.25)\sigma_8(z=0.25)=0.3512\pm0.0583$ and
$f(z=0.37)\sigma_8(z=0.37)=0.4602\pm0.0378$ when no prior is imposed on the
growth-rate, and the background geometry is assumed to follow a $\Lambda$CDM
model with the WMAP + SNIa priors. The standard WMAP constrained $\Lambda$CDM

r' bands, covering a total region of about 1.05 x 1.16 deg^2. Our X-ray
analysis is based on archive XMM-Newton images. Numerical simulations were
performed using an N-body algorithm to treat the dark matter component, a
semi-analytical galaxy formation model for the evolution of the galaxies and a
grid-based hydrodynamic code with a PPM scheme for the dynamics of the
intra-cluster medium. We have computed galaxy luminosity functions (GLFs) and
2D temperature and metallicity maps of the X-ray gas, which we then compared to
the results of our numerical simulations. The GLFs of Abell 1758 North are well
fit by Schechter functions in the g' and r' bands, but a small excess of bright
galaxies, particularly in the r' band. On the contrary, the GLFs of Abell 1758
South are not well fit by Schechter functions: excesses of bright galaxies are
seen in both bands. Comparing observational results to those derived from
numerical simulations, we could mimic the most prominent features present in
the metallicity map and propose an explanation for the dynamical history of the
cluster. Particilarly, we found in particular that in the metal rich elongated
regions of the North cluster, winds had been more efficient in transporting
metal enriched gas to the outskirts than ram pressure stripping. We confirm the
merging structure of each of the North and South clusters, both at optical and

The Single-degenerate Binary Origin of Tycho's Supernova as Traced by  the Stripped Envelope of the Companion","
Abstract: We propose that a non-thermal X-ray arc inside the remnant of Tycho's

companion star's envelope lost in the impact of the explosion. The X-ray
emission of the remnant further shows an apparent shadow casted by the arc in
the opposite direction of the explosion site, consistent with the blocking of
the SN ejecta by the envelope. This scenario supports the single degenerate
binary origin of Tycho's SN. The properties of the X-ray arc, together with the
previous detection of the companion candidate and its space velocity by
Ruiz-Lapuente et al. (2004) and Hern\'{a}ndez et al.(2009), enables us to
further infer 1) the progenitor binary has a period of 4.9$^{+5.3}_{-3.0}$
days, 2) the companion gained a kick velocity of 42$\pm$30 km s$^{-1}$, and 3)
the stripped envelope mass is about 0.0016($\leq0.0083$) $M_{\sun}$. However,
we notice that the nature of the companion candidate is still under debate, and
the above parameters need to be revised according to the actual properties of
the companion candidate. Further work to measure the proper motion of the arc
and to check the capability of the interaction to emit the amount of X-rays
observed from the arc is also needed to validate the current scenario.

summarize the light curves through smooth power law fits with up to three

data can be used for model fits to observational data and as an aid for
predicting observations by future telescopes such as LOFAR or SKA and will
benefit the study of neutron star mergers using different channels, such as
gravitational wave observations with LIGO or Virgo.
For small observer angles, we find jet break times that vary significantly
between frequencies, with the break time in the radio substantially postponed.
Increasing the observer angle also postpones the measured jet break time. The
rising phase of the light curve for large observer angle has a complex shape
that can not always be summarized by a simple power law. Except for very large
observer angles, the counter jet is a distinct feature in the light curve,

then.

The fratricide of alpha-Omega dynamos by their alpha-squared siblings","
Abstract: Context. Helically forced magneto-hydrodynamic shearing-sheet turbulence can
support different large-scale dynamo modes, although the {\alpha} - {\Omega}
mode is generally expected to dominate because it is the fastest growing. In an
{\alpha} - {\Omega} dynamo, most of the field amplification is produced by the
shear. As differential rotation is an ubiquitous source of shear in
astrophysics, such dynamos are believed to be the source of most astrophysical
large-scale magnetic fields. Aims. We study the stability of oscillatory
migratory {\alpha} - {\Omega} type dynamos in turbulence simulations. Methods.
We use shearing-sheet simulations of hydromagnetic turbulence that is helically
forced at a wavenumber that is about three times larger than the lowest
wavenumber in the domain so that both {\alpha} - {\Omega} and {\alpha}2 dynamo
action is possible. Results. After initial dominance and saturation, the
{\alpha} - {\Omega} mode is found to be destroyed by an orthogonal {\alpha}2
mode sustained by the helical turbulence alone. We show that there are at least
two processes through which this transition can occur. Conclusions. The
fratricide of {\alpha} - {\Omega} dynamos by its {\alpha}2 sibling is discussed
in the context of grand minima of solar and stellar activity. However, the
genesis of {\alpha} - {\Omega} dynamos from an {\alpha}2 dynamo has not yet

maximum GW energies could be emitted during gamma-ray flares of highly
magnetized neutron stars (magnetars). The highest energies (\sim 10^{49} erg)
predicted so far come from a model [K. Ioka, Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc. 327,
639 (2001)] in which the internal magnetic field of a magnetar experiences a
global reconfiguration, changing the hydromagnetic equilibrium structure of the
star and tapping the gravitational potential energy without changing the
magnetic potential energy. The largest energies in this model assume very
special conditions, including a large change in moment of inertia (which was
observed in at most one flare), a very high internal magnetic field, and a very
soft equation of state. Here we show that energies of 10^{48}-10^{49} erg are
possible under more generic conditions by tapping the magnetic energy, and we
note that similar energies may also be available through cracking of exotic
solid cores. Current observational limits on gravitational waves from magnetar
fundamental modes are just reaching these energies and will beat them in the
era of advanced interferometers.

Abstract: We develop a unified model of hadrons and quarks. Within this approach we
investigate the phase structure of the model as function of temperature and

neutron and hybrid star masses and radii. In an extension of the investigation
we consider the cooling behavior of the compact stars and derive a general
relation between the star's mass and rotation and its cooling behavior. Finally
we study the effect of Delta resonances for star matter, especially with

Oscillations in the wake of a flare blast wave","
Abstract: Oscillations of coronal loops in the Sun have been reported in both imaging
and spectral observations at the onset of flares. Images reveal transverse
oscillations, whereas spectra detect line-of-sight velocity or Doppler-shift
oscillations. The Doppler-shift oscillations are commonly interpreted as
longitudinal modes. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between loop
dynamics and flows seen in TRACE 195\AA images and Doppler shifts observed by
SUMER in Si III 1113.2\AA and Fe XIX 1118.1\AA at the time of a C.8-class limb
flare and an associated CME. We carefully co-aligned the sequence of TRACE 195
\AA images to structures seen in the SUMER Si III, Ca X,and Fe XIX emission
lines. Additionally, H-alpha observations of a lifting prominence associated
with the flare and the coronal mass ejection (CME) are available in three bands
around 6563.3 \AA . They give constraints on the timing and geometry.
Large-scale Doppler-shift oscillations in Fe XIX and transverse oscillations in
intensity images were observed over a large region of the corona after the
passage of a wide bright extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) disturbance, which suggests
ionization, heating, and acceleration of hot plasma in the wake of a blast
wave.

Determination of the X-ray reflection emissivity profile of 1H 0707-495","
Abstract: When considering the X-ray spectrum resulting from the reflection off the
surface of accretion discs of AGN, it is necessary to account for the variation
in reflected flux over the disc, i.e. the emissivity profile. This will depend
on factors including the location and geometry of the X-ray source and the disc
characteristics. We directly obtain the emissivity profile of the disc from the
observed spectrum by considering the reflection component as the sum of
contributions from successive radii in the disc and fitting to find the
relative weightings of these components in a relativistically-broadened
emission line. This method has successfully recovered known emissivity profiles
from synthetic spectra and is applied to XMM-Newton spectra of the Narrow Line
Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0707-495. The data imply a twice-broken power law form of
the emissivity law with a steep profile in the inner regions of the disc (index
7.8) and then a flat region between 5.6rg and 34.8rg before tending to a
constant index of 3.3 over the outer regions of the disc. The form of the
observed emissivity profile is consistent with theoretical predictions, thus
reinforcing the reflection interpretation.

Megamaser detection and nuclear obscuration in Seyfert galaxies","
Abstract: We revisit the relation between H2O maser detection rate and nuclear
obscuration for a sample of 114 Seyfert galaxies, drawn from the CfA, 12um and
IRAS F25/F60 catalogs. These sources have mid-infrared spectra from the Spitzer
Space Telescope and they are searched for X-ray and [O III], 5007Angstrom
fluxes from the literature. We use the strength of the [O IV], 25.9um emission
line as tracer for the intrinsic AGN strength. After normalization by [O IV]
the observed X-ray flux provides information about X-ray absorption. The
distribution of X-ray / [O IV] flux ratios is significantly different for
masers and non-masers: The maser detected Seyfert-2s (Sy 1.8-2.0) populate a
distinct X-ray / [O IV] range which is, on average, about a factor four lower
than the range of Seyfert-2 non-masers and about a factor of ten lower than the
range of Seyfert-1s (Sy 1.0-1.5). Non-masers are almost equally distributed
over the entire X-ray / [O IV] range. This provides evidence that high nuclear
obscuration plays a crucial role for the probability of maser detection.
Furthermore, after normalization with [O IV], we find a similar but weaker
trend for the distribution of the maser detection rate with the absorption of
the 7um dust continuum. This suggests that the obscuration of the 7 um
continuum occurs on larger spatial scales than that of the X-rays. Hence, in
the AGN unified model, at moderate deviation from edge-on, the 7um dust
absorption may occur without proportionate X-ray absorption. The absorption of
[O III] appears unrelated to maser detections. The failure to detect masers in
obscured AGN is most likely due to insufficient observational sensitivity.

A large-scale R-matrix calculation for electron-impact excitation of the  Ne$^{2+}$ O-like ion","
Abstract: The five J$\Pi$ levels within a $np^2$ or $np^4$ ground state complex provide
an excellent testing ground for the comparison of theoretical line ratios with
astrophysically observed values, in addition to providing valuable electron
temperature and density diagnostics. The low temperature nature of the line
ratios ensure that the theoretically derived values are sensitive to the
underlying atomic structure and electron-impact excitation rates. Previous
R-matrix calculations for the Ne$^{2+}$ O-like ion exhibit large spurious
structure in the cross sections at higher electron energies, which may affect
Maxwellian averaged rates even at low temperatures. Furthermore, there is an
absence of comprehensive excitation data between the excited states that may
provide newer diagnostics to compliment the more established lines discussed in
this paper. To resolve these issues, we present both a small scale 56-level
Breit-Pauli (BP) calculation and a large-scale 554 levels R-matrix Intermediate
Coupling Frame Transformation (ICFT) calculation that extends the scope and
validity of earlier JAJOM calculations both in terms of the atomic structure
and scattering cross sections. Our results provide a comprehensive
electron-impact excitation data set for all transitions to higher $n$ shells.
The fundamental atomic data for this O-like ion is subsequently used within a
collisional radiative framework to provide the line ratios across a range of
electron temperatures and densities of interest in astrophysical observations.

A universal ultraviolet-optical colour-colour-magnitude relation of  galaxies","
Abstract: Although the optical colour-magnitude diagram of galaxies allows one to
select red sequence objects, neither can it be used for galaxy classification
without additional observational data such as spectra or high-resolution
images, nor to identify blue galaxies at unknown redshifts. We show that adding
the near ultraviolet colour to the optical CMD reveals a tight relation in the
three-dimensional colour-colour-magnitude space smoothly continuing from the
""blue cloud"" to the ""red sequence"". We found that 98 per cent of 225,000
low-redshift (Z<0.27) galaxies follow a smooth surface g-r=F(M,NUV-r) with a
standard deviation of 0.03-0.07 mag making it the tightest known galaxy
photometric relation. There is a strong correlation between morphological types
and integrated NUV-r colours. Rare galaxy classes such as E+A or tidally
stripped systems become outliers that occupy distinct regions in the 3D
parameter space. Using stellar population models for galaxies with different
SFHs, we show that (a) the (NUV-r, g-r) distribution is formed by objects
having constant and exponentially declining SFR with different characteristic
timescales; (b) colour evolution for exponentially declining models goes along
the relation suggesting its weak evolution up-to a redshift of 0.9; (c)
galaxies with truncated SFHs have very short transition phase offset from the
relation thus explaining the rareness of E+A galaxies. This relation can be
used as a powerful galaxy classification tool when morphology remains
unresolved. Its mathematical consequence is the photometric redshift estimates
from 3 broad-band photometric points. This approach works better than most
existing photometric redshift techniques applied to multi-colour datasets.
Therefore, the relation can be used as an efficient selection technique for
galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.3<Z<0.8) using optical imaging surveys.

Bayesian re-analysis of the radial velocities of Gliese 581. Evidence in  favour of only four planetary companions","
Abstract: The Gliese 581 planetary system has received attention because it has been
proposed to host a low-mass planet in its habitable zone. We re-analyse the
radial velocity measurements reported to contain six planetary signals to see
whether these conclusions remain valid when the analyses are made using
Bayesian tools instead of the common periodogram analyses. We analyse the
combined radial velocity data set obtained using the HARPS and HIRES
spectrographs using posterior sampling techniques and computation of the
posterior probabilities of models with differing numbers of Keplerian signals.
We do not fix the orbital eccentricities and stellar jitter to certain values
but treat these as free parameters of our statistical models. Hence, we can
take the uncertainties of these parameters into account when assessing the
number of planetary signals present in the data, the point estimates of all of
the model parameters, and the uncertainties of these parameters. We conclude
that based on the Bayesian model probabilities and the nature of the posterior
densities of the different models, there is evidence in favour of four planets
orbiting GJ 581. The HARPS and HIRES data do not imply the conclusion that
there are two additional companions orbiting GJ 581. We also revise the orbital
parameters of the four companions in the system. Especially, according to our
results, the eccentricities of all the companions in the system are consistent
with zero.

Discovery of a possibly old galaxy at $z=6.027$, multiply imaged by the  massive cluster Abell 383","
Abstract: We report the discovery of a unique $z=6.027$ galaxy, multiply imaged by the
cluster Abell 383 and detected in new Hubble Space Telescope ACS and WFC3
imaging, as well as in Warm Spitzer observations. This galaxy was selected as a
pair of i-dropouts; its suspected high redshift was confirmed by the
measurement of a strong Lyman-alpha line in both images using Keck/DEIMOS.
Combining Hubble and Spitzer photometry after correcting for contamination by
line emission (estimated to be a small effect), we identify a strong Balmer
break of 1.5 magnitudes. Taking into account the magnification factor of
11.4+/-1.9 (2.65+/-0.17 mag) for the brightest image, the unlensed AB magnitude
for the source is 27.2+/-0.05 in the H band, corresponding to a 0.4 L* galaxy,
and 25.7+/-0.08 at 3.6 um. The UV slope is consistent with beta~2.0, and from
the rest-frame UV continuum we measure a current star formation rate of
2.4+/-1.1 Msol/yr. The unlensed half-light radius is measured to be 300 pc,
from which we deduce a star-forming surface density of ~10 Msol/yr/kpc2. The
Lyman-alpha emission is found to be extended over ~3"" along the slit,
corresponding to ~5 kpc in the source plane. This can be explained by the
presence of a much larger envelope of neutral hydrogen around the star-forming
region. Finally, fitting the spectral energy distribution using 7 photometric
data points with simple SED models, we derive the following properties: very
little reddening, an inferred stellar mass of M*=6e9 Msol, and an inferred age
of ~800 Myrs (corresponding to a redshift of formation of ~18). The
star-formation rate of this object was likely much stronger in the past than at
the time of observation, suggesting that we may be missing a fraction of
galaxies at z~6 which have already faded in rest-frame UV wavelengths.

An interesting candidate for isolated massive star formation in the  Small Magellanic Cloud","
Abstract: The region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with which this paper is
concerned contains the highest concentration of IRAS/Spitzer sources, H I
emission, and molecular clouds in this neighboring galaxy. However very few
studies have been devoted to it, despite these signs of star formation. We
present the first detailed study of the compact H II region N33 in the SMC by
placing it in a wider context of massive star formation. Moreover, we show that
N33 is a particularly interesting candidate for isolated massive star
formation. This analysis is based mainly on optical ESO NTT observations, both
imaging and spectroscopy, coupled with other archive data, notably Spitzer
images (IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 mic) and 2MASS observations. We derive a
number of physical characteristics of the compact H II region N33 for the first
time. This gas and dust formation of 7"".4 (2.2 pc) in diameter is powered by a
massive star of spectral type O6.5-O7 V. The compact H II region belongs to a
rare class of H II regions in the Magellanic Clouds, called high-excitation
blobs (HEBs). We show that this H II region is not related to any star cluster.
Specifically, we do not find any traces of clustering around N33 on scales
larger than 10"" (~ 3 pc). On smaller scales, there is a marginal stellar
concentration, the low density of which, below the 3 sigma level, does not
classify it as a real cluster. We also verify that N33 is not a member of any
large stellar association. Under these circumstances, N33 is also therefore
attractive because it represents a remarkable case of isolated massive-star
formation in the SMC. Various aspects of the relevance of N33 to the topic of
massive-star formation in isolation are discussed.

KEPLER's First Rocky Planet: Kepler-10b","
Abstract: NASA's Kepler Mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency of
earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. The mission
reached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rocky
planet, Kepler-10b. Two distinct sets of transit events were detected: 1) a 152
+/- 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 +/- 0.024 hours with ephemeris
T[BJD]=2454964.57375+N*0.837495 days and 2) a 376 +/- 9 ppm dimming lasting
6.86 +/- 0.07 hours with ephemeris T[BJD]=2454971.6761+N*45.29485 days.
Statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established the
viability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-up
observations. Forty precision Doppler measurements were used to confirm that
the short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. The parent star
is bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. Photometry was collected at
1-minute cadence for >4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsation
frequencies. Modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of the
fundamental stellar properties. Kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 +/- 4.5
Gyr) but otherwise Sun-like Main Sequence star with Teff=5627 +/- 44 K,
Mstar=0.895 +/- 0.060 Msun, and Rstar=1.056 +/- 0.021 Rsun. Physical models
simultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision Doppler
measurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of Kepler-10b that
speak to its rocky composition: Mpl=4.56 +/- 1.29 Mearth, Rpl=1.416 +/- 0.036

Steady-state evolution of debris disks around solar-type stars","
Abstract: We present an analysis of debris disk data around Solar-type stars (spectral
types F0-K5) using the steady-state analytical model of Wyatt et al. (2007).
Models are fitted to published data from the FEPS (Meyer et al. 2006) project
and various GTO programs obtained with MIPS on the Spitzer Space Telescope at
24 micron and 70 micron, and compared to a previously published analysis of
debris disks around A stars using the same evolutionary model. We find that the
model reproduces most features found in the data sets, noting that the model
disk parameters for solar-type stars are different to those of A stars.
Although this could mean that disks around Solar-type stars have different
properties from their counterparts around earlier-type stars, it is also
possible that the properties of disks around stars of different spectral types
appear more different than they are because the blackbody disk radius
underestimates the true disk radius by a factor $X_r$ which varies with
spectral type. We use results from realistic grain modelling to quantify this
effect for solar-type stars and for A stars. Our results imply that
planetesimals around solar-type stars are on average larger than around A stars
by a factor of a few but that the mass of the disks are lower for disks around
FGK stars, as expected. We also suggest that discrepancies between the
evolutionary timescales of 24 micron statistics predicted by our model and that
observed in previous surveys could be explained by the presence of
two-component disks in the samples of those surveys, or by transient events
being responsible for the 24 micron emission of cold disks beyond a few Myr.
Further study of the prevalence of two component disks, and of constraints on
$X_r$, and increasing the size of the sample of detected disks, are important
for making progress on interpreting the evolution of disks around solar-type
stars.

The Total Mass of Dark Matter Haloes","
Abstract: The simple, conventional dark matter halo mass definitions commonly used in
cosmological simulations (""virial"" mass, FoF mass, $M_{50,100,200,...}$) only
capture part of the collapsed material and are therefore inconsistent with the
halo mass concept used in analytical treatments of structure formation.
Simulations have demonstrated that typical dark matter particle orbits extend
out to about 90 per cent of their turnaround radius, which results in apocenter
passages outside of the current ""virial"" radius on the first and also on the
second orbit. Here we describe how the formation history of haloes can be used
to identify those particles which took part in the halo collapse, but are
missed by conventional group-finders because of their remote present location.
These particles are added to the part of the halo already identified by FoF.
The corrected masses of dark haloes are significantly higher (the median mass
increase is 25 per cent) and there is a considerable shift of the halo mass
function towards the Press & Schechter form. We conclude that meaningful
quantitative comparisons between (semi-)analytic predictions of halo properties
(e.g. mass functions, mass accretion rates, merger rates, spatial clustering,
etc.) and simulation results will require using the same halo definition in
both approaches.

A Chandra study of the large-scale shock and cool filaments in Hydra A:  Evidence for substantial gas dredge-up by the central outburst","
Abstract: We present the results of a Chandra study of the Hydra A galaxy cluster,
where a powerful AGN outburst created a large-scale cocoon shock. We
investigated possible azimuthal variations in shock strength and shape, finding
indications for a weak shock with a Mach number in the range ~1.2-1.3. We
measured the temperature change across the shock front. However, the detection
of a temperature rise in the regions immediately inside of the front is
complicated by the underlying temperature profile of the cluster atmosphere. We
measured the global temperature profile of the cluster up to 700 kpc, which
represents the farthest measurement obtained with Chandra for this cluster. A
""plateau"" in the temperature profile in the range ~70-150 kpc indicates the
presence of cool gas, which is likely the result of uplift of material by the
AGN outburst. After masking the cool filaments visible in the hardness ratio
map, the plateau disappears and the temperature profile recovers a typical
shape with a peak around 190 kpc, just inside the shock front. However, it is
unlikely that such a temperature feature is produced by the shock as it is
consistent with the general shape of the temperature profiles observed for
relaxed galaxy clusters. We studied the spectral properties of the cool
filaments finding evidence that ~10^11 M_sun of low-entropy material has been
dredged up by the rising lobes from the central 30 kpc to the observed current
position of 75-150 kpc. The energy required to lift the cool gas is >~2.2 x
10^60 erg, which is comparable to the work required to inflate the cavities and
is ~25% of the total energy of the large-scale shock. Our results show that the
AGN feedback in Hydra A is acting not only by directly heating the gas, but
also by removing a substantial amount of potential fuel for the SMBH.

Observing Evolution in the Supergranular Length Scale During Periods of  Low Solar Activity","
Abstract: We present the initial results of an observational study into the variation

length-scale reflects the radiative energy in the plasma of the upper solar
chromosphere and transition region at the magnetic network boundaries forming
as a result of the relentless interaction of magnetic fields and convective
motions of the Sun's interior. We demonstrate that a net difference of ~0.5Mm
in the supergranular emission length-scale occurs when comparing observations
cycle 22/23 and cycle 23/24 minima. This variation in scale is reproduced in
the datasets of multiple space- and ground-based instruments and using

observations and analysis presented provide a tantalizing look at solar
activity in the absence of large-scale flux emergence, offering insight into
times of ""extreme"" solar minimum and general behavior such as the phasing and
cross-dependence of different components of the spectral irradiance. Given that
the modulation of the supergranular scale imprints itself in variations of the

entire outer atmosphere, this preliminary investigation is an important step in

The star formation history of the Large Magellanic Cloud star cluster  NGC1751","
Abstract: The HST/ACS colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD) of the populous LMC star cluster

appearance of electron-degeneracy in the H-exhausted cores of the cluster
stars. We then apply to the NGC1751 data the classical method of star formation
history (SFH) recovery via CMD reconstruction, for different radii
corresponding to the cluster centre, the cluster outskirts, and the underlying
LMC field. The mean SFH derived from the LMC field is taken into account during
the stage of SFH-recovery in the cluster regions, in a novel approach which is
shown to significantly improve the quality of the SFH results. For the cluster
centre, we find a best-fitting solution corresponding to prolonged star
formation for a for a timespan of 460 Myr, instead of the two peaks separated
by 200 Myr favoured by a previous work based on isochrone fitting. Remarkably,
our global best-fitting solution provides an excellent fit to the data - with
chi^2 and residuals close to the theoretical minimum - reproducing all the CMD
features including the dual red clump. The results for a larger ring region
around the centre indicate even longer star formation, but in this case the
results are of lower quality, probably because of the differential extinction
detected in the area. Therefore, the presence of age gradients in NGC1751 could
not be probed. Together with our previous findings for the SMC cluster NGC419,

(NS) strongly affects the characteristic (radius, mass) of the star. They are
even separated as a class known as magnetars, for whom the surface magnetic
field are greater than $10^{14}$ G. In this work we discuss the effect of such
high magnetic field on the phase transition of NS to quark star (QS). We study
the effect of magnetic field on the transition from NS to QS including the
magnetic field effect in equation of state (EoS). The inclusion of the magnetic
field increases the range of baryon number density, for which the flow
velocities of the matter in the respective phase are finite. The magnetic field
helps in initiation of the conversion process. The velocity of the conversion
front however decreases due to the presence of magnetic field, as the presence
of magnetic field reduces the effective pressure (P). The magnetic field of the
star gets decreased by the conversion process, and the resultant QS has lower
magnetic field than that of the initial NS.

"Title:
A Constant Molecular Gas Depletion Time in Nearby Disk Galaxies","
Abstract: We combine new sensitive, wide-field CO data from the HERACLES survey with
ultraviolet and infrared data from GALEX and Spitzer to compare the surface
densities of H2, Sigma_H2, and recent star formation rate, Sigma_SFR, over many
thousands of positions in 30 nearby disk galaxies. We more than quadruple the
size of the galaxy sample compared to previous work and include targets with a
wide range of galaxy properties. Even though the disk galaxies in this study
span a wide range of properties, we find a strong and approximately linear
correlation between Sigma_SFR and Sigma_H2 at our common resolution of 1kpc.
This implies a roughly constant median H2 consumption time, tau_H2 = Sigma_H2 /
Sigma_SFR, of ~2.35Gyr (including heavy elements) across our sample. At 1kpc
resolution, there is only a weak correlation between Sigma_H2 and tau_H2 over
the range Sigma_H2~5-100M_sun/pc^2, which is probed by our data. We compile a
broad set of literature measurements that have been obtained using a variety of
star formation tracers, sampling schemes and physical scales and show that
overall, these data yield almost exactly the same results, although with more
scatter. We interpret these results as strong, albeit indirect evidence that
star formation proceeds in a uniform way in giant molecular clouds in the disks
of spiral galaxies.

Carbon Isotope and Isotopomer Fractionation in Cold Dense Cloud Cores","
Abstract: We construct the gas-grain chemical network model which includes carbon
isotopes (12C and 13C) with an emphasis on isotopomer-exchange reactions.
Temporal variations of molecular abundances, the carbon isotope ratios
(12CX/13CX) and the isotopomer ratios (12C13CX/13C12CX) of CCH and CCS in cold
dense cloud cores are investigated by numerical calculations. We confirm that
the isotope ratios of molecules, both in the gas phase and grain surfaces, are
significantly different depending on whether the molecule is formed from the
carbon atom (ion) or the CO molecule. Molecules formed from carbon atoms have
the CX/13CX ratios greater than the elemental abundance ratio of [12C/13C]. On
the other hand, molecules formed from CO molecules have the CX/13CX ratios
smaller than the [12C/13C] ratio. We reproduce the observed C13CH/13CCH ratio
in TMC-1, if the isotopomer exchange reaction, 13CCH + H <-> C13CH + H + 8.1 K,
proceeds with the forward rate coefficient kf > 10^-11 cm3 s-1. However, the
C13CS/13CCS ratio is lower than that observed in TMC-1. We then assume the
isotopomer exchange reaction catalyzed by the H atom, 13CCS + H <-> C13CS + H +
17.4 K. In the model with this reaction, we reproduce the observed C13CS/13CCS,
CCS/C13CS and CCS/13CCS ratio simultaneously.

"Title:
Observational properties of diffuse radio sources in Galaxy Clusters.  Current knowledge and open questions","
Abstract: Diffuse radio sources in galaxy clusters are unique signposts of cluster
assembly in the Universe. Our knowledge of their observational properties has
considerably improved over the past decade, and the long standing questions
concerning their origin and rarity are now starting to receive some answers. It
is nowadays fairly well established that massive cluster mergers are the key
ingredient to account for the origin of halos and relics. The increasing number
of halos and relics found now allow to derive significant statistical
correlations. It has been shown that galaxy clusters may be radio-loud or
radio--quiet with respect to the presence of radio halos. Morevoer, radio halos
and relics are present only in unrelaxed clusters, whereas no such sources have
ever been found in relaxed systems. It has also become clear that a large
distribution exists for the spectral index of the synchrotron spectrum of radio
halos, and ultra-steep halos have been found.
Despite all this, a number of observational issues remain open. Well defined
radio spectra, from ~ hundred MHz to GHz frequencies and good spectral imaging
are available only for few halos and relics, and such information is crucial
for a detailed understanding of their origin. It is presently unclear if there
are basic differences between clusters with ultra steep spectrum radio halos
and those hosting ""classical"" ones, and it is unknown if less energetic mergers
result in an observational signature in the radio band. With the forthcoming
advent of LOFAR and of the SKA Pathfinders, we will soon be able to observe
galaxy clusters with a major improvement in the radio sensitivity and frequency
coverage, and we expect to be able to soon address some of these pressing
questions.

Observational constraints on decaying vacuum dark energy model","
Abstract: The decaying vacuum model (DV), treating dark energy as a varying vacuum, has
been studied well recently. The vacuum energy decays linearly with the Hubble
parameter in the late-times, $\rho_\Lambda(t) \propto H(t)$, and produces the
additional matter component. We constrain the parameters of the DV model using

Near-infrared polarimetry as a tool for testing properties of accreting  super-massive black holes","
Abstract: Several massive black holes exhibit flux variability on time scales that
correspond to source sizes of the order of few Schwarzschild radii. We survey
the potential of near-infrared and X-ray polarimetry to constrain physical
properties of such black hole systems, namely their spin and inclination. We
have focused on a model where an orbiting hot spot is embedded in an accretion
disk. A new method of searching for the time-lag between orthogonal
polarization channels is developed and applied to an ensemble of hot spot
models that samples a wide range of parameter space. We found that the hot spot
model predicts signatures in polarized light which are in the range to be
measured directly in the near future. However, our estimations are predicted
upon the assumption of a Keplerian velocity distribution inside the flow where
the dominant part of the magnetic field is toroidal. We also found that if the
right model of the accretion flow can be chosen for each source (e.g. on the
basis of magnetohydrodynamics simulations) then the black hole spin and
inclination can be constrained to a small two-dimensional area in the
spin-inclination space. The results of the application of the method to the
available near-infrared polarimetric data of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is
presented. It is shown that even with the currently available data the spin and
inclination of Sgr A* can be constrained. Next generations of near-infrared and
X-ray polarimeters should be able to exploit this tool.

"Title:
On the Initial Conditions for Star Formation and the IMF","
Abstract: Density probability distribution functions (PDFs) for turbulent
self-gravitating clouds should be convolutions of the local log-normal PDF,
which depends on the local average density rho-ave and Mach number M, and the
probability distribution functions for rho-ave and M, which depend on the
overall cloud structure. When self-gravity drives a cloud to increased central
density, the total PDF develops an extended tail. If there is a critical
density or column density for star formation, then the fraction of the local
mass exceeding this threshold becomes higher near the cloud center. These
elements of cloud structure should be in place before significant star
formation begins. Then the efficiency is high so that bound clusters form
rapidly, and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) has an imprint in the gas
before destructive radiation from young stars can erase it. The IMF could arise
from a power-law distribution of mass for cloud structure. These structures
should form stars down to the thermal Jeans mass MJ at each density in excess
of a threshold. The high-density tail of the PDF, combined with additional
fragmentation in each star-forming core, extends the IMF into the Brown Dwarf
regime. The core fragmentation process is distinct from the cloud structuring
process and introduces an independen core fragmentation mass function (CFMF).
The CFMF would show up primarily below the IMF peak.

Generalized Non-Commutative Inflation","
Abstract: Non-commutative geometry indicates a deformation of the energy-momentum
dispersion relation $f(E)\equiv\frac{E}{pc}(\neq 1)$ for massless particles.
This distorted energy-momentum relation can affect the radiation dominated
phase of the universe at sufficiently high temperature. This prompted the idea
of non-commutative inflation by Alexander, Brandenberger and Magueijo (2003,
2005 and 2007). These authors studied a one-parameter family of
non-relativistic dispersion relation that leads to inflation: the $\alpha$
family of curves $f(E)=1+(\lambda E)^{\alpha}$. We show here how the
conceptually different structure of symmetries of non-commutative spaces can
lead, in a mathematically consistent way, to the fundamental equations of
non-commutative inflation driven by radiation. We describe how this structure
can be considered independently of (but including) the idea of non-commutative
spaces as a starting point of the general inflationary deformation of
$SL(2,\mathbb{C})$. We analyze the conditions on the dispersion relation that
leads to inflation as a set of inequalities which plays the same role as the
slow roll conditions on the potential of a scalar field. We study conditions
for a possible numerical approach to obtain a general one parameter family of
dispersion relations that lead to successful inflation.

"Title:
Stellar Dynamics of Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals","
Abstract: Inspiral of compact stellar remnants into massive black holes (MBHs) is
accompanied by the emission of gravitational waves at frequencies that are
potentially detectable by space-based interferometers. Event rates computed
from statistical (Fokker-Planck, Monte-Carlo) approaches span a wide range due
to uncertaintities about the rate coefficients. Here we present results from
direct integration of the post-Newtonian N-body equations of motion descrbing
dense clusters of compact stars around Schwarzschild MBHs. These simulations
embody an essentially exact (at the post-Newtonian level) treatment of the
interplay between stellar dynamical relaxation, relativistic precession, and
gravitational-wave energy loss. The rate of capture of stars by the MBH is
found to be greatly reduced by relativistic precession, which limits the
ability of torques from the stellar potential to change orbital angular
momenta. Penetration of this ""Schwarzschild barrier"" does occasionally occur,
resulting in capture of stars onto orbits that gradually inspiral due to
gravitational wave emission; we discuss two mechanisms for barrier penetration
and find evidence for both in the simulations. We derive an approximate formula
for the capture rate, which predicts that captures would be strongly disfavored
from orbits with semi-major axes below a certain value; this prediction, as
well as the predicted rate, are verified in the N-body integrations. We discuss
the implications of our results for the detection of extreme-mass-ratio
inspirals from galactic nuclei with a range of physical properties.

the astronomers showing itself very likely as a Be star. However, a deeper

was a bit more complicated: a) Although it shows evidence of a circumstellar
envelope, its observable properties differ from those typical envelopes in Be
stars. b) Comparison with spectral standards and models indicates a possible
over-abundance in He. This would open the possibility to link the behavior of
BD+53$^\circ$2790 to the He-rich class of stars. c) UV spectra shows an
abnormally slow and dense wind for an O9.5V star. d) Spectral classification in
the IR wavelength region suggest a more likely supergiant nature of the source,
in contradiction with the optical classification. e) The presence of an intense
magnetic field is under investigation. BD+53$^\circ$2790 stands as a perfect

how important the recombination corrections are for a combined Planck, ACTPol

ignoring the clustering of the infrared background would result in a bias in
n_s of 7 sigma. We show that the simultaneous marginalization over a full

uncertainty in cosmological parameters by less than 20%. The small increases in
uncertainty can be significantly reduced with the inclusion of
higher-resolution ground-based data.
The multi-frequency analysis we employ involves modeling 46 total power

Horizontal Branch evolution, metallicity and sdB stars","
Abstract: Context. Abundance anomalies have been observed in field sdB stars and in
nearly all Horizontal Branch (HB) stars of globular clusters with Teff > 11
000K whatever be the cluster metallicity. Aims. The aim is to determine the
abundance variations to be expected in sdB stars and in HB stars of
metallicities Z \geq 0.0001 and what observed abundances teach us about
hydrodynamical processes competing with atomic diffusion. Methods. Complete
stellar evolution models, including the effects of atomic diffusion and
radiative acceleration, have been computed from the zero age main-sequence for
metallicities of Z0 = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.004 and 0.02. On the HB the masses were
selected to cover the Teff interval from 7000 to 37000K. Some 60 evolutionary
HB models were calculated. The calculations of surface abundance anomalies
during the horizontal branch depend on one parameter, the surface mixed mass.
Results. For sdB stars with Teff < 37000K and for HB stars with Teff > 11 000K
in all observed clusters, independent of metallicity, it was found that most
observed abundance anomalies (even up to ~ x 200) were compatible, within error
bars, with expected abundances. A mixed mass of ~1.E-7 M\odot was determined by
comparison with observations. Conclusions. Observations of globular cluster HB
stars with Teff > 11 000K and of sdB stars with Teff < 37 000K suggest that
most observed abundance anomalies can be explained by element separation driven
by radiative acceleration occuring at a mass fraction of ~1.E-7 M\odot. Mass
loss or turbulence appear to limit the separation between 1.E-7 M\odot and the
surface.

photometry consists of exposures obtained with a typical spacing of several

random variations in the low state are ~2x those in the high state, when
expressed in magnitudes. The lack of orbital-time-scale variations is
attributed to the nearly face-on presentation of the disk. There is a 0.2 mag
decline in the high state brightness of the system over 19 years, which is
consistent with the behavior of other old novae in the decades following
outburst. High-state spectra are also presented and discussed. We find that the
equivalent width of H$\alpha$ falls by ~2x from 1991 to 2008. The photometric
properties are discussed in the context of the hibernation scenario for the
behavior of novae between outbursts, in which we conclude that low states in
old novae are probably unrelated to their possible entrance into hibernation.

The properties of SN Ib/c locations","
Abstract: Aims: To gain better insight on the physics of stripped-envelope
core-collapse supernovae through studying their environments. Methods: We
obtained low-resolution optical spectroscopy with the New Technology Telescope
(+ EFOSC2) at the locations of 20 Type Ib/c supernovae. We measure the flux of
emission lines in the stellar-continuum-subtracted spectra from which local
metallicities are computed. For the supernova regions we estimate both the mean
stellar age, interpreting the stellar absorption with population synthesis
models, and the age of the youngest stellar populations using the H-alpha
equivalent width as an age indicator. These estimates are compared with the
lifetimes of single massive stars. Results: Based on our sample, we detect a
tentative indication that Type Ic supernovae might explode in environments that
are more metal-rich than those of Type Ib supernovae (average difference of
0.08 dex), but this is not a statistically significant result. The lower limits
placed on the ages of the supernova birthplaces are overall young, although
there are several cases where these appear older than what is expected for the
evolution of single stars more massive than 25-30 M_{sun}. This is only true,
however, assuming that the supernova progenitors were born during an
instantaneous (not continuous) episode of star formation. Conclusions: These
results do not conclusively favor any of the two evolutionary paths (single or
binary) leading to stripped supernovae. We do note a fraction of events for
which binary evolution is more likely, due to their associated age limits. The
fact, however, that the supernova environments contain areas of recent (< 15
Myr) star formation and that the environmental metallicities are, at least, not
against the single evolutionary scenario, suggest that this channel is also
broadly consistent with the observations.

Accounting for Calibration Uncertainties in X-ray Analysis: Effective  Areas in Spectral Fitting","
Abstract: While considerable advance has been made to account for statistical
uncertainties in astronomical analyses, systematic instrumental uncertainties
have been generally ignored. This can be crucial to a proper interpretation of
analysis results because instrumental calibration uncertainty is a form of
systematic uncertainty. Ignoring it can underestimate error bars and introduce
bias into the fitted values of model parameters. Accounting for such
uncertainties currently requires extensive case-specific simulations if using
existing analysis packages. Here we present general statistical methods that
incorporate calibration uncertainties into spectral analysis of high-energy
data. We first present a method based on multiple imputation that can be
applied with any fitting method, but is necessarily approximate. We then
describe a more exact Bayesian approach that works in conjunction with a Markov
chain Monte Carlo based fitting. We explore methods for improving computational
efficiency, and in particular detail a method of summarizing calibration
uncertainties with a principal component analysis of samples of plausible
calibration files. This method is implemented using recently codified Chandra
effective area uncertainties for low-resolution spectral analysis and is
verified using both simulated and actual Chandra data. Our procedure for
incorporating effective area uncertainty is easily generalized to other types
of calibration uncertainties.

Abstract: We present SEREN, a new hybrid Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and N-body
code designed to simulate astrophysical processes such as star and planet
formation. It is written in Fortran 95/2003 and has been parallelised using
OpenMP. SEREN is designed in a flexible, modular style, thereby allowing a
large number of options to be selected or disabled easily and without
compromising performance. SEREN uses the conservative `grad-h' formulation of
SPH, but can easily be configured to use traditional SPH or Godunov SPH.
Thermal physics is treated either with a barotropic equation of state, or by
solving the energy equation and modelling the transport of cooling radiation. A
Barnes-Hut tree is used to obtain neighbour lists and compute gravitational
accelerations efficiently, and an hierarchical time-stepping scheme is used to
reduce the number of computations per timestep. Dense gravitationally bound
objects are replaced by sink particles, to allow the simulation to be evolved
longer, and to facilitate the identification of protostars and the compilation
of stellar and binary properties. At the termination of a hydrodynamical
simulation, SEREN has the option of switching to a pure N-body simulation,
using a 4th-order Hermite integrator, and following the ballistic evolution of
the sink particles (e.g. to determine the final binary statistics once a star
cluster has relaxed). We describe in detail all the algorithms implemented in

"Title:
Low-velocity collisions of centimeter-sized dust aggregates","
Abstract: Collisions between centimeter- to decimeter-sized dusty bodies are important
to understand the mechanisms leading to the formation of planetesimals. We thus
performed laboratory experiments to study the collisional behavior of dust
aggregates in this size range at velocities below and around the fragmentation
threshold. We developed two independent experimental setups with the same goal
to study the effects of bouncing, fragmentation, and mass transfer in free
particle-particle collisions. The first setup is an evacuated drop tower with a
free-fall height of 1.5 m, providing us with 0.56 s of microgravity time so
that we observed collisions with velocities between 8 mm/s and 2 m/s. The
second setup is designed to study the effect of partial fragmentation (when
only one of the two aggregates is destroyed) and mass transfer in more detail.
It allows for the measurement of the accretion efficiency as the samples are
safely recovered after the encounter. Our results are that for very low
velocities we found bouncing as could be expected while the fragmentation
velocity of 20 cm/s was significantly lower than expected. We present the
critical energy for disruptive collisions Q*, which showed up to be at least
two orders of magnitude lower than previous experiments in the literature. In
the wide range between bouncing and disruptive collisions, only one of the
samples fragmented in the encounter while the other gained mass. The accretion
efficiency in the order of a few percent of the particle's mass is depending on
the impact velocity and the sample porosity. Our results will have consequences
for dust evolution models in protoplanetary disks as well as for the strength
of large, porous planetesimal bodies.

"Title:
Extreme value statistics of smooth random Gaussian fields","
Abstract: We consider the Gumbel or extreme value statistics describing the
distribution function p_G(x_max) of the maximum values of a random field x
within patches of fixed size. We present, for smooth Gaussian random fields in
two and three dimensions, an analytical estimate of p_G which is expected to
hold in a regime where local maxima of the field are moderately high and weakly
clustered. When the patch size becomes sufficiently large, the negative of the
logarithm of the cumulative extreme value distribution is simply equal to the
average of the Euler Characteristic of the field in the excursion x > x_max
inside the patches. The Gumbel statistics therefore represents an interesting
alternative probe of the genus as a test of non Gaussianity, e.g. in cosmic
microwave background temperature maps or in three-dimensional galaxy catalogs.
It can be approximated, except in the remote positive tail, by a negative
Weibull type form, converging slowly to the expected Gumbel type form for
infinitely large patch size. Convergence is facilitated when large scale
correlations are weaker. We compare the analytic predictions to numerical
experiments for the case of a scale-free Gaussian field in two dimensions,
achieving impressive agreement between approximate theory and measurements. We
also discuss the generalization of our formalism to non-Gaussian fields.

Light bending scenario for accreting black holes in X-ray polarimetry","
Abstract: We discuss a model of an X-ray illuminating source above an accretion disk of
a rotating black hole. Within the so called lamp-post scheme we compute the
expected (observed) polarization properties of the radiation reaching an
observer. We explore the dependencies on model parameters, employing Monte
Carlo radiation transfer computations of the X-ray reflection on the accretion
disk and taking general relativity effects into account. In particular, we
discuss the role of the black hole spin, of the observer viewing angle, and of
the primary X-ray source distance from the black hole. We give several examples
of the resulting polarization degree for two types of exemplary objects -
active galactic nuclei and Galactic black holes. In order to assess potential
observability of the polarization features, we assume the sensitivity of the
proposed New Hard X-ray Mission (NHXM).
We examine the energy range from several keV to ~50 keV, so the iron-line
complex and the Compton hump are included in our model spectra. We find the
resultant polarization degree to increase at the higher end of the studied
energy band, i.e. at >~20 keV. Thus, the best results for polarimetry of
reflection spectra should be achieved at the Compton hump energy region. We
also obtain higher polarization degree for large spin values of the black hole,
small heights of the primary source, and low inclination angles of the
observer.

A study of 315 glitches in the rotation of 102 pulsars","
Abstract: The rotation of more than 700 pulsars has been monitored using the 76-m
Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank. Here we report on a new search for glitches
in the observations, revealing 128 new glitches in the rotation of 63 pulsars.
Combining these new data with those already published we present a database
containing 315 glitches in 102 pulsars. The database was used to study the
glitch activity among the pulsar population, finding that it peaks for pulsars
with a characteristic age tau_c ~ 10kyr and decreases for longer values of
tau_c, disappearing for objects with tau_c > 20Myr. The glitch activity is also
smaller in the very young pulsars (tau_c <~ 1kyr). The cumulative effect of
glitches, a collection of instantaneous spin up events, acts to reduce the
regular long term spindown rate |nudot| of the star. The percentage of |nudot|
reversed by glitch activity was found to vary between 0.5% and 1.6% for pulsars
with spindown rates |nudot| between 10^(-14) and 3.2*10^(-11) Hz/s, decreasing
to less than 0.01% at both higher and lower spindown rates. These ratios are
interpreted in terms of the amount of superfluid involved in the generation of
glitches. In this context the activity of the youngest pulsar studied, the Crab
pulsar, may be explained by quake-like activity within the crust. Pulsars with
low spindown rates seem to exhibit mostly small glitches, matching well the
decrease of their crustal superfluid.
Through the analysis of glitch sizes it was found that the particular
glitching behaviour of PSR J0537-6910 and the Vela pulsar may be shared by most
Vela-like pulsars. These objects present most of their glitches with
characteristic frequency and frequency derivative jumps, occurring at regular
intervals of time. Their behaviour is different from other glitching pulsars of
similar characteristic age.

"Title:
Carbon chemistry in Galactic Bulge Planetary Nebulae","
Abstract: Galactic Bulge Planetary Nebulae show evidence of mixed chemistry with
emission from both silicate dust and PAHs. This mixed chemistry is unlikely to
be related to carbon dredge up, as third dredge-up is not expected to occur in
the low mass Bulge stars. We show that the phenomenon is widespread, and is
seen in 30 nebulae out of 40 of our sample, selected on the basis of their
infrared flux. HST images and UVES spectra show that the mixed chemistry is not
related to the presence of emission-line stars, as it is in the Galactic disk
population. We also rule out interaction with the ISM as origin of the PAHs.
Instead, a strong correlation is found with morphology, and the presence of a
dense torus. A chemical model is presented which shows that hydrocarbon chains
can form within oxygen-rich gas through gas-phase chemical reactions. The model
predicts two layers, one at $A_V\sim 1.5$ where small hydrocarbons form from
reactions with C$^+$, and one at $A_V\sim 4$, where larger chains (and by
implication, PAHs) form from reactions with neutral, atomic carbon. These
reactions take place in a mini-PDR. We conclude that the mixed chemistry
phenomenon occurring in the Galactic Bulge Planetary Nebulae is best explained
through hydrocarbon chemistry in an UV-irradiated, dense torus.

The nearest neighbor statistics for X-ray source counts II. Chandra Deep  Field South","
Abstract: It is assumed that the unresolved fraction of the X-ray background (XRB)
consists of a truly diffuse component and a population of the weak sources
below the present detection threshold. Albeit these weak sources are not
observed directly, their collective nature could be investigated by statistical
means. The goal is to estimate the source counts below the conventional
detection limit in the Chandra Deep Field-South 2Ms exposure. The source number
counts are assessed using the nearest neighbor statistics applied to the
distribution of photon counts. The method is described in the first paper of
these series. The source counts down to 3-4 x 10^{-18} cgs in the soft band
(0.5-2 keV) and down to 2-3 x 10^{-17} cgs in the hard band (2-8 keV) are
evaluated. It appears that in the soft band the source counts steepen
substantially below ~10^{-16} cgs. Assuming that the differential slope b =
-1.5 to -1.6 in the range 10^{-16} - 10^{-14} cgs, the number of weaker sources
indicates the slope of approx. -2.0. The steepening is not observed in the hard
band. Steepening of counts in the soft band indicates a new population of
sources. A class of normal galaxies at moderate redshifts is a natural
candidate.

Evolution of a buried magnetic field in the central compact object  neutron stars","
Abstract: The central compact objects are a newly-emerging class of young neutron stars
near the centre of supernova remnants. From X-ray timing and spectral
measurements, their magnetic fields are determined to be ~ 10^10-10^11 G, which
is significantly lower than that found on most pulsars. Using the latest
electrical and thermal conductivity calculations, we solve the induction
equation to determine the evolution of a buried crustal or core magnetic field.
We apply this model of a buried field to explain the youth and low observed
magnetic field of the central compact objects. We obtain constraints on their
birth magnetic field and depth of submergence (or accreted mass). Measurement
of a change in the observed magnetic field strength would discriminate between
the crustal and core fields and could yield uniquely the birth magnetic field
and submergence depth. If we consider the central compact objects as a single
neutron star viewed at different epochs, then we constrain the magnetic field
at birth to be ~ (6-9)x10^11 G. A buried magnetic field can also explain their
location in an underpopulated region of the spin period-period derivative plane
for pulsars.

A companion candidate in the gap of the T Cha transitional disk","
Abstract: T Cha is a young star surrounded by a cold disk. The presence of a gap within
its disk, inferred from fitting to the spectral energy distribution, has
suggested on-going planetary formation. We observed T Cha in L' and K_s with
NAOS-CONICA, the adaptive optics system at the VLT, using sparse aperture
masking. We detected a source in the L' data at a separation of 62+-7 mas,
position angle of 78+-1 degrees, and a contrast of delta L' = 5.1+-0.2 mag. The
object is not detected in the Ks band data, which show a 3-sigma contrast limit
of 5.2 mag at the position of the detected L' source. For a distance of 108 pc,
the detected companion candidate is located at 6.7 AU from the primary, well
within the disk gap. If T Cha and the companion candidate are bound, the
comparison of the L' and Ks photometry with evolutionary tracks shows that the
photometry is inconsistent with any unextincted photosphere at the age and
distance of T Cha. The detected object shows a very red Ks-L' color for which a
possible explanation would be a significant amount of dust around it. This
would imply that the companion candidate is young, which would strengthen the
case for a physical companion, and moreover that the object would be in the
substellar regime, according to the Ks upper limit. Another exciting
possibility would be that this companion is a recently formed planet within the
disk. Additional observations are mandatory to confirm that the object is bound
and to properly characterize it.

"Title:
Physics of Coevolution of Galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes","
Abstract: A new model for coevolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH)
is presented that is physically based. The evolutionary track starts with an
event that triggers a significant starburst in the central region of a galaxy.
In this model, the main SMBH growth takes place in post-starburst phase fueled
by recycled gas from inner bulge stars in a self-regulated fashion on a time
scale that is substantially longer than 100Myrs and at a diminishing Eddington
ratio with time. We argue that the SMBH cannot gorge itself during the
starburst phase, despite the abundant supply of cold gas, because star
formation is a preferred mode of gas consumption in such an environment than
accretion to the central SMBH. We also show that feedback from star formation
is at least as strong as that from AGN and thus, if star formation is in need
of being quenched, AGN feedback generally does not play the primary role. The
predicted relation between SMBH mass and bulge mass/velocity dispersion is
consistent with observations. A clear prediction is that early-type galaxy
hosts of high Eddingtion rate AGNs are expected to be light-blue to green in
optical color, gradually evolving to the red sequences with decreasing AGN
luminosity. A suite of falsifiable predictions and implications with respect to
relationships between various types of galaxies and AGN, and others, are made.
For those where comparisons to extant observations are possible, the model
appears to be in good standing.

Radiation pressure feedback in the formation of massive stars","
Abstract: We investigate the radiation pressure feedback in the formation of massive
stars in 1, 2, and 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the collapse of
massive pre-stellar cores. In contrast to previous research, we consider
frequency dependent stellar radiation feedback, resolve the dust sublimation
front in the vicinity of the forming star down to 1.27 AU, compute the
evolution for several 10^5 yrs covering the whole accretion phase of the
forming star, and perform a comprehensive survey of the parameter space. The
most fundamental result is that the formation of a massive accretion disk in
slowly rotating cores preserves a high anisotropy in the radiation field. The
thermal radiation escapes through the optically thin atmosphere, effectively
diminishing the radiation pressure feedback onto the accretion flow.
Gravitational torques in the self-gravitating disk drive a sufficiently high
accretion rate to overcome the residual radiation pressure. Simultaneously, the
radiation pressure launches an outflow in the bipolar direction, which grows in
angle with time and releases a substantial fraction of the initial core mass
from the star-disk system. Summarized, for an initial core mass of 60, 120,
240, and 480 Msol these mechanisms allow the star to grow up to 28.2, 56.5,
92.6, and at least 137.2 Msol respectively.

Micrometer-sized ice particles for planetary-science experiments - I.  Preparation, critical rolling friction force, and specific surface energy","
Abstract: Coagulation models assume a higher sticking threshold for micrometer-sized
ice particles than for micrometer-sized silicate particles. However, in
contrast to silicates, laboratory investigations of the collision properties of
micrometer-sized ice particles (in particular, of the most abundant water ice)
have not been conducted yet. Thus, we used two different experimental methods
to produce micrometer-sized water ice particles, i. e. by spraying water
droplets into liquid nitrogen and by spraying water droplets into a cold
nitrogen atmosphere. The mean particle radii of the ice particles produced with
these experimental methods are $(1.49 \pm 0.79) \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ and $(1.45
\pm 0.65) \, \mathrm{\mu m}$. Ice aggregates composed of the micrometer-sized
ice particles are highly porous (volume filling factor: $\phi = 0.11 \pm 0.01$)
or rather compact (volume filling factor: $\phi = 0.72 \pm 0.04$), depending on
the method of production. Furthermore, the critical rolling friction force of
$F_{Roll,ice}=(114.8 \pm 23.8) \times 10^{-10}\, \mathrm{N}$ was measured for
micrometer-sized ice particles, which exceeds the critical rolling friction
force of micrometer-sized $\mathrm{SiO_2}$ particles ($F_{Roll,SiO_2}=(12.1 \pm
3.6) \times 10^{-10}\, \mathrm{N}$). This result implies that the adhesive
bonding between micrometer-sized ice particles is stronger than the bonding
strength between $\mathrm{SiO_2}$ particles. An estimation of the specific
surface energy of micrometer-sized ice particles, derived from the measured
critical rolling friction forces and the surface energy of micrometer-sized
$\mathrm{SiO_2}$ particles, results in $\gamma_{ice} = 0.190 \, \mathrm{J \,

Equilibrium and Dynamical Evolution of Self-Gravitating System Embedded  in a Potential Well","
Abstract: Isothermal and self-gravitating systems bound by non-conducting and
conducting walls are known to be unstable if the density contrast between the
center and the boundary exceeds critical values. We investigate the equilibrium
and dynamical evolution of isothermal and self-gravitating system embedded in
potential well, which can be the situation of many astrophysical objects such
as the central parts of the galaxies, or clusters of galaxies with potential
dominated by dark matter, but is still limited to the case where the potential
well is fixed during the evolution. As the ratio between the depth of
surrounding potential well and potential of embedded system becomes large, the
potential well becomes effectively the same boundary condition as conducting
wall, which behaves like a thermal heat bath. We also use the direct N-body
simulation code, NBODY6 to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar system
embedded in potential wells and propose the equilibrium models for this system.
In deep potential well, which is analogous to the heat bath with high
temperature, the embedded self-gravitating system is dynamically hot, and
loosely bound or can be unbound since the kinetic energy increases due to the
heating by the potential well. On the other hand, the system undergoes core
collapse by self-gravity when potential well is shallow. Binary heating can
stop the collapse and leads to the expansion, but the evolution is very slow
because the potential as a heat bath can absorb the energy generated by the
binaries. The system can be regarded as quasi-static. Density and velocity
dispersion profiles from the N-body simulations in the final quasi-equilibrium
state are similar to our equilibrium models assumed to be in thermal
equilibrium with the potential well.

"Title:
Formation of Giant Planets by Disk Instability on Wide Orbits Around  Protostars with Varied Masses","
Abstract: Doppler surveys have shown that more massive stars have significantly higher
frequencies of giant planets inside $\sim$ 3 AU than lower mass stars,
consistent with giant planet formation by core accretion. Direct imaging
searches have begun to discover significant numbers of giant planet candidates
around stars with masses of $\sim$ 1 $M_\odot$ to $\sim$ 2 $M_\odot$ at orbital
distances of $\sim$ 20 AU to $\sim$ 120 AU. Given the inability of core
accretion to form giant planets at such large distances, gravitational
instabilities of the gas disk leading to clump formation have been suggested as
the more likely formation mechanism. Here we present five new models of the
evolution of disks with inner radii of 20 AU and outer radii of 60 AU, for
central protostars with masses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 $M_\odot$, in
order to assess the likelihood of planet formation on wide orbits around stars
with varied masses. The disk masses range from 0.028 $M_\odot$ to 0.21
$M_\odot$, with initial Toomre $Q$ stability values ranging from 1.1 in the
inner disks to $\sim 1.6$ in the outer disks. These five models show that disk
instability is capable of forming clumps on time scales of $\sim 10^3$ yr that,
if they survive for longer times, could form giant planets initially on orbits
with semimajor axes of $\sim$ 30 AU to $\sim$ 70 AU and eccenticities of $\sim$
0 to $\sim$ 0.35, with initial masses of $\sim 1 M_{Jup}$ to $\sim 5 M_{Jup}$,
around solar-type stars, with more protoplanets forming as the mass of the
protostar (and protoplanetary disk) are increased. In particular, disk
instability appears to be a likely formation mechanism for the HR 8799 gas

Abstract: We conducted an X-ray spectroscopic study of the classical nova V2491 Cygni

interval between days -322 and -100 all relative to the time when the classical
nova was spotted. We found remarkable changes in the time series of the
spectra: (a) In the pre-nova phase and on day 9, the 6.7 keV emission line from
Fe XXV was significantly detected. (b) On day 29, no such emission line was
found. (c) On day 40, the 6.7 keV emission line emerged again. (d) On days 50

quasi-neutral Fe, Fe XXV, and Fe XXVI were found. Statistically significant
changes of the Fe K line intensities were confirmed between day 29 and 50.
Based on these phenomena, we conclude that (1) the post-nova evolution can be
divided into two different phases, (2) ejecta is responsible for the X-ray
emission in the earlier phase, while rekindled accretion is for the later
phase, and (3) the accretion process is considered to be reestablished as early
as day 50 when the quasi-neutral Fe emission line emerged, which is a common
signature of accretion from magnetic cataclysmic variables.

Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV), optical and near infrared (NIR) observations of the type
IIP supernova (SN) 2007od are presented, covering from the maximum light to the
late phase, allowing to investigate in detail different physical phenomena in
the expanding ejecta. These data turn this object into one of the most peculiar
IIP ever studied. The early light curve of SN 2007od is similar to that of a
bright IIPs with a short plateau, a bright peak (MV = -18 mag), but a very
faint optical light curve at late time. However, with the inclusion of mid
infrared (MIR) observations during the radioactive decay we have estimate a
M(56Ni) ~ 2\times10^-2 M\odot. Modeling the bolometric light curve, ejecta
expansion velocities and black-body temperature, we estimate a total ejected
mass was 5 - 7.5 M\odot with a kinetic energy of at least 0.5 \times 10^51 erg.
The early spectra reveal a boxy H{\alpha} profile and high velocities features
of the Balmer series that suggest interaction between the ejecta and a close
circum-stellar matter (CSM). SN 2007od may be, therefore, an intermediate case
between a Type IIn SN and a typical Type IIP SN. Also late spectra show a clear
evidence of CSM and the presence of dust formed inside the ejecta. The episodes
of mass loss short before explosion, the bright plateau, along with the
relatively small amount of 56Ni and the faint [O I] observed in the nebular
spectra are consistent with a super-asympthotic giant branch (super-AGB)

forming arm and within a half-light radius (solar metallicity region) of a
nearby spiral galaxy NGC 3672. The SN event was detected late and a detailed
investigation of its light curves and spectra spanning 200 days suggest that it

in contrast to other events of its class, the SN 2008gz exhibits rarely
observed V magnitude drop of 1.5 over the period of a month during plateau to
nebular phase. Using 0.21 mag of Av as a lower limit and a distance of 25.5
Mpc, we estimate synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.05 \pm 0.01 M* and a
mid-plateau Mv of -16.6 \pm 0.2 mag. The photospheric velocity is observed to
be higher than that was observed for SN 2004et at similar epochs, indicating
explosion energy was comparable to or higher than SN 2004et. Similar trend was
also seen for the expansion velocity of H-envelopes. By comparing its

"Title:
PAndAS' progeny: extending the M31 dwarf galaxy cabal","
Abstract: We present the discovery of five new dwarf galaxies, Andromeda XXIII-XXVII,
located in the outer halo of M31. These galaxies were found in the second year
of data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) of the M31/M33
subgroup. This survey now provides an almost complete panoramic view of the M31
halo out to an average projected radius of ~150 kpc. The metal-poor stellar
density map for this whole region serves, not only as an illustration of the
discovery space for satellite galaxies, but also gives a birds-eye view of the
ongoing assembly process of an L* disk galaxy. Four of the new dwarfs appear as
well-defined spatial over-densities of stars lying on the expected locus of
metal-poor red giant branch stars at the distance of M31. The fifth
over-density, And XXVII, is embedded in an extensive stream of such stars and
is possibly the remnant of a strong tidal disruption event. All five satellites
have metallicities and luminosities typical of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and
continue the trend whereby the brighter dwarf spheroidal satellites of M31
generally have much larger half-light radii than their Milky Way counterparts.
With an extended sample of M31 satellite galaxies we also revisit the spatial
distribution of this population and find that, within the current limits of the
PAndAS survey, the surface density of satellites is essentially constant out to
150 kpc. This corresponds to a radial density distribution of satellites
varying as 1/r, a result seemingly in conflict with the predictions of
cosmological simulations. (Abridged)

"Title:
Measuring Redshift-Space Distortions using Photometric Surveys","
Abstract: We outline how redshift-space distortions (RSD) can be measured from the
angular correlation function w({\theta}), of galaxies selected from photometric
surveys. The natural degeneracy between RSD and galaxy bias can be minimized by
comparing results from bins with top-hat galaxy selection in redshift, and bins
based on the radial position of galaxy pair centres. This comparison can also
be used to test the accuracy of the photometric redshifts. The presence of RSD
will be clearly detectable with the next generation of photometric redshift
surveys. We show that the Dark Energy Survey (DES) will be able to measure
f(z){\sigma}_8(z) to a 1{\sigma} accuracy of (17 {\times} b)%, using galaxies
drawn from a single narrow redshift slice centered at z = 1. Here b is the
linear bias, and f is the logarithmic rate of change of the linear growth rate
with respect to the scale factor. Extending to measurements of w({\theta}) for
a series of bins of width 0.02(1 + z) over 0.5 < z < 1.4 will measure {\gamma}
to a 1{\sigma} accuracy of 25%, given the model f = {\Omega}_m(z)^{\gamma}, and
assuming a linear bias model that evolves such that b = 0.5 + z (and fixing
other cosmological parameters). The accuracy of our analytic predictions is
confirmed using mock catalogs drawn from simulations conducted by the MICE

"Title:
Source detection in interferometric visibility data. I. Fundamental  estimation limits","
Abstract: Transient radio signals of astrophysical origin present an avenue for
studying the dynamic universe. With the next generation of radio
interferometers being planned and built, there is great potential for detecting
and studying large samples of radio transients. Currently-used image-based
techniques for detecting radio sources have not been demonstrated to be
optimal, and there is a need for development of more sophisticated algorithms,
and methodology for comparing different detection techniques. A
visibility-space detector benefits from our good understanding of
visibility-space noise properties, and does not suffer from the image artifacts
and need for deconvolution in image-space detectors. In this paper, we propose
a method for designing optimal source detectors using visibility data, building
on statistical decision theory. The approach is substantially different to
conventional radio astronomy source detection. Optimal detection requires an
accurate model for the data, and we present a realistic model for the
likelihood function of radio interferometric data, including the effects of
calibration, signal confusion and atmospheric phase fluctuations. As part of
this process, we derive fundamental limits on the calibration of an
interferometric array, including the case where many relatively weak ""in-beam""
calibrators are used. These limits are then applied, along with a model for
atmospheric phase fluctuations, to determine the limits on measuring source
position, flux density and spectral index, in the general case. We then present
an optimal visibility-space detector using realistic models for an
interferometer.

Studies of methanol maser rings","
Abstract: We present the results of studies of a new class of 6.7 GHz methanol maser
sources with a ring-like emission structure discovered recently with the EVN.
We have used the VLA to search for water masers at 22 GHz and radio continuum
at 8.4 GHz towards a sample of high-mass star forming regions showing a

found mid-infrared (MIR) counterparts of five methanol rings with a resolution

only 0.""2 of the MIR emission peak, implying their physical relation with a
central star. These results strongly support a scenario wherein the ring-like
structures appear at the very early stage of massive star formation before
either water-maser outflows or H II regions are seen.

Magnetic Cycles in a Convective Dynamo Simulation of a Young Solar-type  Star","
Abstract: Young solar-type stars rotate rapidly and many are magnetically active; some
undergo magnetic cycles similar to the 22-year solar activity cycle. We conduct
simulations of dynamo action in rapidly rotating suns with the 3D MHD anelastic
spherical harmonic (ASH) code to explore dynamo action achieved in the
convective envelope of a solar-type star rotating at 5 times the current solar
rotation rate. Striking global-scale magnetic wreaths appear in the midst of
the turbulent convection zone and show rich time-dependence. The dynamo
exhibits cyclic activity and undergoes quasi-periodic polarity reversals where
both the global-scale poloidal and toroidal fields change in sense on a roughly
1500 day time scale. These magnetic activity patterns emerge spontaneously from
the turbulent flow and are more organized temporally and spatially than those
realized in our previous simulations of the solar dynamo. We assess in detail
the competing processes of magnetic field creation and destruction within our
simulations that contribute to the global-scale reversals. We find that the
mean toroidal fields are built primarily through an $\Omega$-effect, while the
mean poloidal fields are built by turbulent correlations which are not
necessarily well represented by a simple $\alpha$-effect. During a reversal the
magnetic wreaths propagate towards the polar regions, and this appears to arise
from a poleward propagating dynamo wave. The primary response in the convective
flows involves the axisymmetric differential rotation which shows variations
associated with the poleward propagating magnetic wreaths. In the Sun, similar
patterns are observed in the poleward branch of the torsional oscillations, and
these may represent poleward propagating magnetic fields deep below the solar
surface. [abridged]

A High Speed Networked Signal Processing Platform for Multi-element  Radio Telescopes","
Abstract: A new architecture is presented for a Networked Signal Processing System
(NSPS) suitable for handling the real-time signal processing of multi-element
radio telescopes. In this system, a multi-element radio telescope is viewed as
an application of a multi-sensor, data fusion problem which can be decomposed
into a general set of computing and network components for which a practical
and scalable architecture is enabled by current technology. The need for such a
system arose in the context of an ongoing program for reconfiguring the Ooty
Radio Telescope (ORT) as a programmable 264-element array, which will enable
several new observing capabilities for large scale surveys on this mature
telescope. For this application, it is necessary to manage, route and combine
large volumes of data whose real-time collation requires large I/O bandwidths
to be sustained. Since these are general requirements of many multi-sensor
fusion applications, we first describe the basic architecture of the NSPS in
terms of a Fusion Tree before elaborating on its application for the ORT. The
paper addresses issues relating to high speed distributed data acquisition,
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based peer-to-peer networks supporting
significant on-the fly processing while routing, and providing a last mile
interface to a typical commodity network like Gigabit Ethernet. The system is
fundamentally a pair of two co-operative networks, among which one is part of a
commodity high performance computer cluster and the other is based on
Commercial-Off The-Shelf (COTS) technology with support from software/firmware
components in the public domain.

"Title:
Dilaton dominance in the early Universe dilutes Dark Matter relic  abundances","
Abstract: The role of the dilaton field and its coupling to matter may result to a
dilution of Dark Matter (DM) relic densities. This is to be contrasted with
quintessence scenarios in which relic densities are augmented, due to
modification of the expansion rate, since Universe is not radiation dominated
at DM decoupling. Dilaton field, besides this, affects relic densities through
its coupling to dust which tends to decrease relic abundances. Thus two
separate mechanisms compete each other resulting, in general, to a decrease of
the relic density. This feature may be welcome and can rescue the situation if
Direct Dark Matter experiments point towards small neutralino-nucleon cross
sections, implying small neutralino annihilation rates and hence large relic
densities, at least in the popular supersymmetric scenarios. In the presence of
a diluting mechanism both experimental constraints can be met. The role of the
dilaton for this mechanism has been studied in the context of the non-critical
string theory but in this work we follow a rather general approach assuming
that the dilaton dominates only at early eras long before Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis.

Effects of high-energy ionizing particles on the Si:As mid-infrared  detector array on board the AKARI satellite","
Abstract: We evaluate the effects of high-energy ionizing particles on the Si:As
impurity band conduction (IBC) mid-infrared detector on board AKARI, the
Japanese infrared astronomical satellite. IBC-type detectors are known to be
little influenced by ionizing radiation. However we find that the detector is
significantly affected by in-orbit ionizing radiation even after spikes induced
by ionizing particles are removed. The effects are described as changes mostly
in the offset of detector output, but not in the gain. We conclude that the
changes in the offset are caused mainly by increase in dark current. We
establish a method to correct these ionizing radiation effects. The method is
essential to improve the quality and to increase the sky coverage of the AKARI

"Title:
The Christiansen Effect in Saturn's narrow dusty rings and the spectral  identification of clumps in the F ring","
Abstract: Stellar occultations by Saturn's rings observed with the Visual and Infrared
Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft reveal that dusty
features such as the F ring and the ringlets in the Encke and the Laplace Gaps
have distinctive infrared transmission spectra. These spectra show a narrow
optical depth minimum at wavelengths around 2.87 microns. This minimum is
likely due to the Christiansen Effect, a reduction in the extinction of small
particles when their (complex) refractive index is close to that of the
surrounding medium. Simple Mie-scattering models demonstrate that the strength
of this opacity dip is sensitive to the size distribution of particles between
1 and 100 microns across. Furthermore, the spatial resolution of the
occultation data is sufficient to reveal variations in the transmission spectra
within and among these rings. For example, in both the Encke Gap ringlets and F
ring, the opacity dip weakens with increasing local optical depth, which is
consistent with the larger particles being concentrated near the cores of these
rings. The strength of the opacity dip varies most dramatically within the F
ring; certain compact regions of enhanced optical depth lack an opacity dip and
therefore appear to have a greatly reduced fraction of grains in the few-micron
size range.Such spectrally-identifiable structures probably represent a subset
of the compact optically-thick clumps observed by other Cassini instruments.
These variations in the ring's particle size distribution can provide new
insights into the processes of grain aggregation, disruption and transport
within dusty rings. For example, the unusual spectral properties of the F-ring
clumps could perhaps be ascribed to small grains adhering onto the surface of
larger particles in regions of anomalously low velocity dispersion.

Numerical simulation of time delay interferometry for a LISA-like  mission with the simplification of having only one interferometer","
Abstract: In order to attain the requisite sensitivity for LISA, laser frequency noise
must be suppressed below the secondary noises such as the optical path noise,
acceleration noise etc. In a previous paper (Dhurandhar et al., Class. Quantum
Grav., 27, 135013, 2010), we have found a large family of second-generation
analytic solutions of time delay interferometry with one arm dysfunctional, and
we also estimated the laser noise due to residual time-delay semi-analytically
from orbit perturbations due to Earth. Since other planets and solar-system
bodies also perturb the orbits of LISA spacecraft and affect the time delay
interferometry (TDI), we simulate the time delay numerically in this paper for
all solutions with the generation number n \leq 3. We have worked out a set of
3-year optimized mission orbits of LISA spacecraft starting at January 1, 2021
using the CGC2.7 ephemeris framework. We then use this numerical solution to
calculate the residual optical path differences in the second-generation
solutions of our previous paper, and compare with the semi-analytic error
estimate. The accuracy of this calculation is better than 1 cm (or 30 ps). The
maximum path length difference, for all configuration calculated, is below 1 m
(3 ns). This is well below the limit under which the laser frequency noise is
required to be suppressed. The numerical simulation in this paper can be
applied to other space-borne interferometers for gravitational wave detection
with the simplification of having only one interferometer.

The micro-structure of the intergalactic medium I: the 21cm signature  from dynamical minihaloes","
Abstract: A unified description is provided for the 21cm signatures arising from
minihaloes against a bright background radio source and against the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB), within the context of a dynamical collapsing
cosmological spherical halo model. The equivalent width distribution of the
resulting 21cm forest is computed for LCDM cosmologies, along with the
brightness temperature differential relative to the CMB. The effects of an
ambient Ly-alpha radiation field and heating of the IGM on the signatures are
included. It is shown that the dynamical effects of heating substantially
suppress absorption features in the 21cm forest with observed equivalent widths
exceeding 0.15 kHz. It is demonstrated how measurements of excess fluctuations
beyond detector noise could make a statistical detection of the weaker
absorption features against a bright background radio source. It is also shown
that a Ly-alpha radiation field only a few percent the thermalisation rate is
sufficient to render the minihalo signal against the CMB negligible compared
with the signal from the diffuse IGM component. The 21cm signals are found to
be very sensitive to the amount of small scale power in the primordial density
fluctuation spectrum. The effects of gas cooling via radiative atomic and
molecular processes and of star formation on setting the maximum mass of the
minihaloes giving rise to a 21cm signal are included, with allowance made for
the suppression of molecular hydrogen formation by an ambient UV radiation
field.

Abstract: The X-ray binary LSI +61 303, consisting of a main sequence Be star and a

showed a clear intensity modulation as a function of the orbital phase. We
describe a gamma-ray attenuation model and apply it to this system. Our first
result is that interaction of high energy photons with the background radiation
produced by the main sequence star alone does not account for the observed
modulation. We then include interactions between very high energy radiation and
matter, and are able to constrain fundamental parameters of the system such as
the mass of the compact object and the density of circumstellar matter around
the Be star. In our analysis of the TeV data, we find that the compact object
has mass $M_2>2.5M_{\odot}$ at the 99% confidence level, implying it is most
likely a black hole. However, we find a column density which conflicts with
results from X-ray observations, suggesting that attenuation may not play an
important role in the modulation.

of 129 disk-like galaxies with z_AB<22.5 in the redshift range 0.2<z<1.3, based
on spectra from DEIMOS on the Keck II telescope, multi-color HST ACS
photometry, and ground-based Ks-band imaging. A unique feature of our survey is
the extended spectroscopic integration times, leading to significant
improvements in determining characteristic rotational velocities for each
galaxy. Rotation curves are reliably traced to the radius where they begin to
flatten for ~90% of our sample, and we model the HST-resolved bulge and disk
components in order to accurately de-project our measured velocities,
accounting for seeing and dispersion. We demonstrate the merit of these
advances by recovering an intrinsic scatter on the stellar mass Tully-Fisher
relation a factor of 2-3 less than in previous studies at intermediate redshift
and comparable to that of locally-determined relations. With our increased
precision, we find the relation is well-established by <z>~1, with no
significant evolution to <z>~0.3, \DeltaM_stellar ~ 0.04+/-0.07 dex. A clearer
trend of evolution is seen in the B-band Tully-Fisher relation corresponding to
a decline in luminosity of \DeltaM_B ~ 0.85+/-0.28 magnitudes at fixed velocity
over the same redshift range, reflecting the changes in star formation over
this period. As an illustration of the opportunities possible when gas masses

mass data can be used to evaluate the likely contributions of baryons and dark

Systematic biases on galaxy haloes parameters from Yukawa-like  gravitational potentials","
Abstract: A viable alternative to the dark energy as a solution of the cosmic speed up
problem is represented by Extended Theories of Gravity. Should this be indeed
the case, there will be an impact not only on cosmological scales, but also at
any scale, from the Solar System to extragalactic ones. In particular, the
gravitational potential can be different from the Newtonian one commonly
adopted when computing the circular velocity fitted to spiral galaxies rotation
curves. Phenomenologically modelling the modified point mass potential as the
sum of a Newtonian and a Yukawa like correction, we simulate observed rotation
curves for a spiral galaxy described as the sum of an exponential disc and a
NFW dark matter halo. We then fit these curves assuming parameterized halo
models (either with an inner cusp or a core) and using the Newtonian potential
to estimate the theoretical rotation curve. Such a study allows us to
investigate the bias on the disc and halo model parameters induced by the
systematic error induced by forcing the gravity theory to be Newtonian when it
is not. As a general result, we find that both the halo scale length and virial
mass are significantly overestimated, while the dark matter mass fraction
within the disc optical radius is typically underestimated. Moreover, should
the Yukawa scale length be smaller than the disc half mass radius, then the
logarithmic slope of the halo density profile would turn out to be shallower
than the NFW one. Finally, cored models are able to fit quite well the
simulated rotation curves, provided the disc mass is biased high in agreement
with the results in literature, favoring cored haloes and maximal discs. Such
results make us argue that the cusp/core controversy could actually be the
outcome of an incorrect assumption about which theory of gravity must actually
be used in computing the theoretical circular velocity.

Abstract: Both the recently reported anomalous secular increase of the astronomical

postulating that the acceleration of a test particle orbiting a central body,

occasions, all inorganic scintillators (NaI, CsI, and BGO) of the two
subsystems detected significant gamma-ray signals lasting for >1 minute.
Neither of these two events were associated with any lightning. In both cases,
the gamma-ray energy spectra extend to 10 MeV, suggesting that the detected
gamma-rays are produced by relativistic electrons via bremsstrahlung. Assuming
that the initial photon spectrum at the source is expressed by a power-law
function,the observed photons can be interpreted as being radiated from a
source located at a distance of 290-560 m for the 2007 event and 110-690 m for
the 2008 one, both at 90% confidence level.Employing these photon spectra, the

generally agrees with those calculated based on the relativistic runaway
electron avalanche model. A GROWTH photon spectrum, summed over 3 individual

SGR 0418+5729 - How does a Young Neutron Star Spin Down to a 9 s Period  with a Dipole Field less than 10^13 G?","
Abstract: The period derivative bound for SGR 0418+5729 (Rea et al. 2010) establishes
the magnetic dipole moment to be distinctly lower than the magnetar range,
placing the source beyond the regime of isolated pulsar activity in the P -
dP/dt diagram and giving a characteristic age > 2 \times 10^{7} years, much
older than the 10^5 year age range of SGRs and AXPs. So the spindown must be
produced by a mechanism other than dipole radiation in vacuum. A fallback disk
will spin down a neutron star with surface dipole magnetic field in the 10^{12}
G range and initial rotation period P_0 ~ 100 ms to the 9.1 s period of SGR
0418+5729 in a few 10^4 to ~10^5 years. The current upper limit to the period
derivative gives a lower limit of \sim 10^5 years to the age that is not
sensitive to the neutron star's initial conditions. The total magnetic field on
the surface of SGR 0418+5729 could be significantly larger than its 10^{12} G
dipole component.

"Title:
The Distribution of Transit Durations for Kepler Planet Candidates and  Implications for their Orbital Eccentricities","
Abstract: Doppler planet searches have discovered that giant planets follow orbits with
a wide range of orbital eccentricities, revolutionizing theories of planet
formation. The discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by NASA's Kepler
mission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution of
small exoplanets. Measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is only
practical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques
(e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry).
Yet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to study
the distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transit
durations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). We
analyze the transit duration distribution of Kepler planet candidates. We find
that for host stars with T_eff > 5100 K we cannot invert this to infer the
eccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possible
systematics in the host star densities. With this limitation in mind, we
compare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule out
extreme distributions. If we assume a Rayleigh eccentricity distribution for
Kepler planet candidates, then we find best-fits with a mean eccentricity of
0.1-0.25 for host stars with T_eff < 5100 K. We compare the transit duration
distribution for different subsets of Kepler planet candidates and discuss
tentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. High-precision
spectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will be
required to confirm which trends are real and which are the results of
systematic errors in stellar radii. Finally, we identify planet candidates that
must be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.

"Title:
The Carina Project. IV. radial velocity distribution","
Abstract: We present new and accurate radial velocity (RV) measurements of luminous
stars of all ages (old horizontal branch, intermediate--age red clump, and
young blue plume, as well as red giants of a range of ages; 20.6<V<22) in the
Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy, based on low-resolution spectra collected with
the FORS2 multi-object slit spectrograph at the VLT. This data set was
complemented by RV measurements based on medium and high-resolution archive
spectra of brighter (V<20.6) Carina targets collected with the GIRAFFE
multi-object fiber spectrograph at the VLT. The combined sample includes more
than 21,340 individual spectra of ~2,000 stars covering the entire body of the
galaxy. To further improve the statistics, the accurate RV measurements
recently provided by Walker et al.(2007) were also added to the current data
set. We ended up with a sample of ~1,370 RV measurements of candidate Carina
stars that is ~75% larger than any previous Carina RV sample. The mean RV
across the body of the galaxy varies from ~220 km/s at a distance of 7arcmin
(~200 pc) from the center to ~223 km/s at 13arcmin, (~400 pc, 6sigma level) and
flattens out to a constant value of ~221 km/s at larger distances (600 pc,
4sigma level). Moreover and even more importantly, we found that in the Carina
regions where the mean RV is smaller the dispersion is also smaller, and the RV
distribution is more centrally peaked (i.e. the kurtosis attains larger
values). There is evidence of a secondary maximum in RV across the Carina
center (|D|<200 pc). The occurrence of a secondary feature across the Carina
center is also supported by the flat-topped radial distribution based on the
photometric catalog.

"Title:
Measurements of the spectral energy distribution of the cosmic infrared  background","
Abstract: The extragalactic background light (EBL) is the relic emission of all
processes of structure formation in the Universe. About half of this
background, called the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) is emitted in the
8-1000 microns range, and peaks around 150 microns. It is due to the dust
reemission from star formation processes and AGN emission. The CIB spectral
energy distribution (SED) constraints the models of star formation in the
Universe. It is also useful to compute the opacity of the Universe to the TeV
photons.
We present the different types of measurements of the CIB and discuss their
strengths and weaknesses.
1. The absolute SED was measured by COBE, and by other experiments. These
measurements are limited by the accuracy of the component separation, i.e. the
foreground subtraction.
2. Robust lower limits are determined from the extragalactic number counts of
infrared galaxies. These lower limits are very stringent up to 100 microns. At
larger wavelengths, the rather low angular resolution of the instruments limits
strongly the depth of the number counts. The ""stacking"" method determines the
flux emitted at a given wavelength by a population detected at another
wavelength, and provides stringent lower limits in the sub-mm range. It is
complementary with other methods based on the statistical analysis of the map
properties like the P(D) analysis.
3. Finally, upper limits can be derived from the high energy spectra of
extragalactic sources. These upper limits give currently good constraints in
the near- and mid-IR.
Progress have been amazing since the CIB discovery about 15 years ago: the
SED is much better known, and most of it can be accounted for by galaxies
(directly or indirectly). Prospects are also exciting, with fluctuation
analysis with Planck&Herschel, and forthcoming missions.

"Title:
New approaches to the exploration: planet Mars and bacterial life","
Abstract: Planet Mars past environmental conditions were similar to the early Earth,
but nowadays they are similar to those of a very cold desert, irradiated by
intense solar UV light. However, some terrestrial lifeform showed the
capability to adapt to very harsh environments, similar to the extreme
condition of the Red Planet. In addition, recent discoveries of water in the
Martian permafrost and of methane in the Martian atmosphere, have generated
optimism regarding a potentially active subsurface Mars' biosphere. These
findings increase the possibility of finding traces of life on a planet like
Mars. However, before landing on Mars with dedicated biological experiments, it
is necessary to understand the possibilities of finding life in the present
Martian conditions. Finding a lifeform able to survive in Martian environment
conditions may have a double meaning: increasing the hope of discovering
extraterrestrial life and defining the limits for a terrestrial contamination
of planet Mars. In this paper we present the Martian environment simulators
LISA and mini-LISA, operating at the Astronomical Observatory of Padua, Italy.
They have been designed to simulate the conditions on the surface of planet
Mars (atmospheric pressure,0.6-0.9 kPa; temperature from -120 to 20 {\deg}C,
Martian-like atmospheric composition and UV radiation). In particular, we
describe the mini-LISA simulator, that allows to perform experiments with no
time limits, by weekly refueling the liquid nitrogen reservoir. Various kind of
experiments may be performed in the simulators, from inorganic chemistry to
biological activity. They are offered as experimental facilities to groups
interested in studying the processes that happen on the Martian surface or
under its dust cover.

Infrared photometric study of the massive star forming region S235 using  Spitzer-IRAC and JHK observations","
Abstract: We present the {\it Spitzer}-IRAC images of the S235 star forming complex
that includes the East~1 & 2, Central and S235 A & B regions. In addition, we
present the near-infrared images of the S235 A & B regions. The IRAC photometry
reveals on-going star formation, with 86 Class 0/I and 144 Class II YSOs in the
entire S235 complex. Nearly 73% of these YSOs are present in clusters with a
maximum surface density of 120 YSOs/pc$^{2}$ (in the vicinity of S235A & B
regions). A few YSOs, possibly in an arc-like formation, are identified towards
the south of S235A region, which may be speculated as an evidence for
magnetically super-critical collapse. One of the sources in the arc-like
formation, namely S235AB-MIR, seems to be a young, massive star that is still
accreting matter. SED modeling of some of the newly identified YSOs confirms
the classification made on the basis of IRAC colours. The IRAC ratio map of
Ch2/Ch4 traces clearly the Br$\alpha$ emission associated with the HII region
of S235A within the horse-shoe envelope. Outside the horse-shoe structure, the
ratio map indicates shock-excited H$_{2}$ emission. Br$\alpha$ emission is also
seen around S235B (from the ratio map). The ratio map of Ch2/Ch4 reveals that
the source ""e2s3"" in the East~2 region may be associated with shock-excited
H$_2$ emission outflow or jet. The SED modeling of this new source indicates
that it is a very young massive star that is not yet able to drive an HII
region.

"Title:
On infrared and ultraviolet divergences of cosmological perturbations","
Abstract: We study a consistent infrared and ultraviolet regularization scheme for the
cosmological perturbations. The infrared divergences are cured by assuming that
the Universe undergoes a transition between a non-singular pre-inflationary,
radiation-dominated phase and a slow-roll inflationary evolution. The
ultraviolet divergences are eliminated via adiabatic subtraction. A consistent
regularization of the field fluctuations through this transition is obtained by
performing a mode matching for both the gauge invariant Mukhanov variable and
its adiabatic expansion. We show that these quantities do not generate
ultraviolet divergences other than the standard ones, when evolving through the
matching time. We also show how the de Witt-Schwinger expansion, which can be
used to construct the counter-terms regularizing the ultraviolet divergences,
ceases to be valid well before horizon exit of the scales of interest. Thus,
such counter-terms should not be used beyond the time of the horizon exit so it
is unlikely that the observed power spectrum is modified by adiabatic
subtraction as claimed in the literature. However, the infrared regularization
might have an impact on the observed spectrum, and we briefly discuss this
possibility.

"Title:
Rotating Massive Main-Sequence Stars II: Simulating a Population of LMC  early B-type Stars as a Test of Rotational Mixing","
Abstract: Rotational mixing in massive stars is a widely applied concept, with far
reaching consequences for stellar evolution. Nitrogen surface abundances for a
large and homogeneous sample of massive B-type stars in the LMC were obtained
by the VLT-FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars. This sample is the first covering a
broad range of projected stellar rotational velocities, with a large enough
sample of high quality data to allow for a statistically significant analysis.
We use the sample to provide the first rigorous test of the theory of
rotational mixing in massive stars. We calculated a grid of stellar evolution
models, using the FLAMES sample to calibrate some of the uncertain mixing
processes. We developed a new population-synthesis code, which uses this grid
to simulate a large population of stars with masses, ages and rotational
velocity distributions consistent with those from the FLAMES sample. The
synthesized population is then filtered by the selection effects in the
observed sample, to enable a direct comparison between the empirical results
and theoretical predictions. Our simulations reproduce the fraction of stars
without significant nitrogen enrichment. The predicted number of rapid rotators
with enhanced nitrogen is about twice as large as found observationally.
Furthermore, a group of stars consisting of slowly rotating, nitrogen-enriched
objects and another consisting of rapidly rotating un-enriched objects can not
be reproduced by our single-star population synthesis. Additional physical
processes appear to be required to understand the population of massive
main-sequence stars from the FLAMES sample.We discuss the possible role of
binary stars and magnetic fields in the interpretation of our results. We find
that the population of slowly rotating nitrogen-enriched stars is unlikely
produced via mass transfer and subsequent tidal spin-down in close binary
systems

Intranight variability of 3C 454.3 during its 2010 November outburst","
Abstract: Context. 3C 454.3 is a very active flat spectrum radio quasar (blazar) that
has undergone a recent outburst in all observed bands, including the optical.
Aims. In this work we explore the short-term optical variability of 3C 454.3

bands. Finding one would be important for understanding the evolution of the
spectrum of the relativistic electrons, which generate the synchrotron jet
emission.
Methods. We performed photometric monitoring of the object by repeating
exposures in different optical bands (BVRI). Occasionally, different telescopes
were used to monitor the object in the same band to verify the reliability of
the smallest variations we observed.
Results. Except on one occasion, where we found indications of a lag of the
blue wavelengths behind the red ones, the results are inconclusive for most of
the other cases. There were either no structures in the light curves to be able
to search for patterns, or else different approaches led to different
conclusions.

"Title:
The evolution of M 2-9 from 2000 to 2010","
Abstract: M 2-9, the Butterfly nebula, is an outstanding representative of extreme
aspherical flows. It presents unique features such as a pair of high-velocity
dusty polar blobs and a mirror-symmetric rotating pattern in the inner lobes.
Imaging monitoring of the evolution of the nebula in the past decade is
presented. We determine the proper motions of the dusty blobs, which infer a
new distance estimate of 1.3+-0.2 kpc, a total nebular size of 0.8 pc, a speed
of 147 km/s, and a kinematical age of 2500 yr. The corkscrew geometry of the
inner rotating pattern is quantified. Different recombination timescales for
different ions explain the observed surface brightness distribution. According
to the images taken after 1999, the pattern rotates with a period of 92+-4 yr.
On the other hand, the analysis of images taken between 1952 and 1977 measures
a faster angular velocity. If the phenomenon were related to orbital motion,
this would correspond to a modest orbital eccentricity (e=0.10+-0.05), and a
slightly shorter period (86+-5 yr). New features have appeared after 2005 on
the west side of the lobes and at the base of the pattern. The geometry and
travelling times of the rotating pattern support our previous proposal that the
phenomenon is produced by a collimated spray of high velocity particles (jet)
from the central source, which excites the walls of the inner cavity of M 2-9,
rather than by a ionizing photon beam. The speed of such a jet would be
remarkable: between 11000 and 16000 km/s. The rotating-jet scenario may explain
the formation and excitation of most of the features observed in the inner
nebula, with no need for additional mechanisms, winds, or ionization sources.
All properties point to a symbiotic-like interacting binary as the central
source of M 2-9.

"Title:
On the occurrence and detectability of Bose-Einstein condensation in  helium white dwarfs","
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that helium white dwarfs may provide promising
conditions for the occurrence of the Bose-Einstein condensation. The argument
supporting this expectation is that in some conditions attained in the core of
these objects, the typical De Broglie wavelength associated with helium nuclei
is of the order of the mean distance between neighboring nuclei. In these
conditions the system should depart from classical behavior showing quantum
effects. As helium nuclei are bosons, they are expected to condense.
In order to explore the possibility of detecting the Bose-Einstein
condensation in the evolution of helium white dwarfs we have computed a set of
models for a variety of stellar masses and values of the condensation
temperature. We do not perform a detailed treatment of the condensation process
but mimic it by suppressing the nuclei contribution to the equation of state by
applying an adequate function. As the cooling of white dwarfs depends on
average properties of the whole stellar interior, this procedure should be
suitable for exploring the departure of the cooling process from that predicted
by the standard treatment.
We find that the Bose-Einstein condensation has noticeable, but not dramatic
effects on the cooling process only for the most massive white dwarfs
compatible with a helium dominated interior (\approx 0.50 M_\odot) and very low
luminosities (say, Log(L/L_\odot) < -4.0). These facts lead us to conclude that
it seems extremely difficult to find observable signals of the Bose-Einstein
condensation.
Recently, it has been suggested that the population of helium white dwarfs
detected in the globular cluster NGC 6397 is a good candidate for detecting
signals of the Bose-Einstein condensation. We find that these stars have masses
too low and are too bright to have an already condensed interior.

Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study of the energetic interaction between the

optical emission line nebula in the galaxy cluster Sersic 159-03. We use X-ray
data from Chandra, high resolution X-ray spectra and UV images from XMM-Newton,
Halpha images from the SOAR telescope, HST optical imaging, and VLA and GMRT
radio data. The cluster center displays signs of powerful AGN feedback, which
has cleared the central regions (r<7.5 kpc) of dense, X-ray emitting ICM. X-ray
spectral maps reveal a high pressure ring surrounding the central AGN at a
radius of r~15 kpc, indicating an AGN driven weak shock. The cluster harbors a
bright, 44 kpc long Halpha+[NII] filament extending from the centre of the cD
galaxy to the north. Along the filament, we see low entropy, high metallicity,
cooling X-ray gas. The gas in the filament has most likely been uplifted by
`radio mode' AGN activity and subsequently stripped from the galaxy due to its
relative southward motion. Because this X-ray gas has been removed from the
direct influence of the AGN jets, part of it cools and forms stars as indicated
by the observed dust lanes, molecular and ionized emission line nebulae, and
the excess UV emission.

"Title:
Using Kuiper Belt Binaries to Constrain Neptune's Migration History","
Abstract: Approximately 10-20% of all Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) occupy mean-motion
resonances with Neptune. This dynamical configuration likely resulted from
resonance capture as Neptune migrated outward during the late stages of planet
formation. The details of Neptune's planetesimal-driven migration, including
its radial extent and the concurrent eccentricity evolution of the planet, are
the subject of considerable debate. Two qualitatively different proposals for
resonance capture have been proposed--migration-induced capture driven by
smooth outward evolution of Neptune's orbit and chaotic capture driven by
damping of the planet's eccentricity near its current semi-major axis. We
demonstrate that the distribution of comparable-mass, wide-separation binaries
occupying resonant orbits can differentiate between these two scenarios. If
migration-induced capture occurred, this fraction records information about the
formation locations of different populations of KBOs. Chaotic capture, in
contrast, randomizes the orbits of bodies as they are placed in resonance. In
particular, migration-induced capture produces the following signatures. The
2:1 resonance should contain a dynamically cold component, with inclinations
less than 5-10 degrees, having a binary fraction comparable to that among cold
classical KBOs. If the 3:2 resonance also hosts a cold component, its binary
fraction should be 20-30% lower than in the cold classical belt. Among cold 2:1
(and if present 3:2) KBOs, objects with eccentricities e < 0.2 should have a
binary fraction ~20% larger than those with e > 0.2. Searches for cold
components in the binary fractions of resonant KBOs are currently practical.
The additional migration-generated trends described here may be distinguished
with objects discovered by LSST. (Abstract abridged.)

Relativistic Expansion of Magnetic Loops at the Self-similar Stage II:  Magnetized outflows interacting with the ambient plasma","
Abstract: We obtained self-similar solutions of relativistically expanding magnetic
loops by assuming axisymmetry and a purely radial flow. The stellar rotation
and the magnetic fields in the ambient plasma are neglected. We include the
Newtonian gravity of the central star. These solutions are extended from those
in our previous work (Takahashi, Asano, & Matsumoto 2009) by taking into
account discontinuities such as the contact discontinuity and the shock. The
global plasma flow consists of three regions, the outflowing region, the post
shocked region, and the ambient plasma. They are divided by two
discontinuities. The solutions are characterized by the radial velocity, which
plays a role of the self-similar parameter in our solutions. The shock Lorentz
factor gradually increases with radius. It can be approximately represented by
the power of radius with the power law index of 0.25.
We also carried out magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of
magnetic loops to study the stability and the generality of our analytical
solutions. We used the analytical solutions as the initial condition and the
inner boundary conditions. We confirmed that our solutions are stable over the
simulation time and that numerical results nicely recover the analytical
solutions. We then carried out numerical simulations to study the generality of
our solutions by changing the power law index \delta of the ambient plasma
density \rho_0 \propto r^{-\delta}. We alter the power law index \delta from
3.5 in the analytical solutions. The analytical solutions are used as the
initial conditions inside the shock in all simulations. We observed that the
shock Lorentz factor increases with time when \delta is larger than 3, while it
decreases with time when \delta is smaller than 3. The shock Lorentz factor is
proportional to t^{(\delta-3)/2}. These results are consistent with the
analytical studies by Shapiro (1979).

determine the recent (< 1 Gyr) star formation history of M83. We selected 50

based on their H? morphology. To determine ages of stars in each region, the
color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and the color-color diagrams were used with the
Padova isochrones with a metallicity of Z=0.03 (1.5 Z{\odot}). We correct the
foreground and internal extinction of individual stars using the reddening-free
Q parameter and improve our age estimates of stars from the isochrone fitting
on the CMDs. Comparisons of stellar ages and cluster ages based on both their
H? morphology and their spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting were made

determined younger than 10 Myr are located preferentially along the active
star-forming regions on the spiral arm.

Wide Binary Stars in the Galactic Field - A Statistical Approach","
Abstract: This thesis focuses on the statistical properties of wide binary (WB) star
systems in the Galactic field. For the present study we select a homogeneous
sample covering about 675 square degrees in the direction of the NGP. It
contains nearly 670,000 MS stars with apparent magnitudes between 15 and 20.5
mag and spectral classes later than G5. The data were taken from the SDSS. We
construct the two-point correlation function (2PCF) for angular separations
between 2 and 30 arcsecs. The resulting clustering signal is modeled by means
of the Wasserman-Weinberg technique. We show that the distribution of
semi-major axis is consistent with the canonical Oepik law and infer that about
10% of all stars in the solar neighbourhood belong to a WB system. To reduce
the noise from optical pairs and to increase the sensitivity of the analysis at
larger separations, we include distance information from photometric
parallaxes. Introducing a novel weighting procedure based on the binding
probability of a double star, we infer the distribution of colours and mass
ratios, which were carefully corrected for observational selection effects.
About 4,000 WBs were taken into account statistically, whose components have
masses between 0.2 and 0.85 solar masses. We find that the WB colour
distribution is in accord with the colour distribution of single field stars.
However, pairs with a mass difference exceeding 0.5 solar masses seem to be
systematically underrepresented as compared to a random pairing of field stars.
Our results are broadly in agreement with prior studies but a direct comparison
is difficult and often impossible. The novel procedure presented in this thesis
can be regarded as complementary to common proper motion studies, and
constitutes a viable approach to study the statistical properties of WBs in the
Galactic field.

Gamma-ray blazars: the view from AGILE","
Abstract: During the first 3 years of operation the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector onboard
the AGILE satellite detected several blazars in a high gamma-ray activity: 3C
279, 3C 454.3, PKS 1510-089, S5 0716+714, 3C 273, W Comae, Mrk 421, PKS
0537-441 and 4C +21.35. Thanks to the rapid dissemination of our alerts, we
were able to obtain multiwavelength data from other observatories such as
Spitzer, Swift, RXTE, Suzaku, INTEGRAL, MAGIC, VERITAS, and ARGO as well as
radio-to-optical coverage by means of the GASP Project of the WEBT and the REM
Telescope. This large multifrequency coverage gave us the opportunity to study
the variability correlations between the emission at different frequencies and
to obtain simultaneous spectral energy distributions of these sources from
radio to gamma-ray energy bands, investigating the different mechanisms
responsible for their emission and uncovering in some cases a more complex
behaviour with respect to the standard models. We present a review of the most
interesting AGILE results on these gamma-ray blazars and their multifrequency
data.

High resolution imaging of the GG Tau system at 267 GHz","
Abstract: Studying circumbinary disks is critical to understanding the formation
mechanisms of binary stars. While optical or mid-infrared images reveal the
scattered mission, millimeter observations provide direct measurements of the
dust thermal emission. We study the properties of the circumbinary disk around
the well-known, multiple young stellar object GG Tau with the highest possible
sensitivity and spatial resolution. We mapped the continuum emission of GG Tau
at 267 GHz using the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer equipped with upgraded
receivers and LO systems. An angular resolution of 0.45""x0.25"" was achieved,
corresponding to a linear resolution of 65x35 AU. The GG Tau A circumbinary
disk is observed as an extremely clearly defined narrow ring. The width of the
ring is not resolved. Emission from the central binary is detected and clearly
separated from the ring: it coincides with the GG Tau Aa position and may
therefore trace a circumstellar disk around this star. The mass ratio of the
circumbinary to circumprimary material is ~80.

Formation of Zr I and II lines under non-LTE conditions of stellar  atmospheres","
Abstract: The non-local thermodynaic equilibrium (non-LTE) line formation for the two
ions of zirconium is considered through a range of spectral types when the Zr
abundance varies from the solar value down to [Zr/H] = -3. The model atom was
built using 148 energy levels of Zr I, 772 levels of Zr II, and the ground
state of Zr III. It was shown that the main non-LTE mechnism for the minority
species Zr I is ultraviolet overionization. Non-LTE leads to systematically
depleted total absorption in the Zr I lines and positive abundance corrections,
reaching to 0.33 dex for the solar metallicity models. The excited levels of Zr
II are overpopulated relative to their thermodynamic equilibrium populations in
the line formation layers due to radiative pumping from the low-excitation
levels. As a result, the line source function exceeds the Planck function
leading to weakening the Zr II lines and positive non-LTE abundance
corrections. Such corrections grow towards lower metallicity and lower surface
gravity and reach to 0.34 dex for Teff = 5500 K, log g = 2.0, [M/H] = -2. As a
test and first application of the Zr I-Zr II model atom, Zr abundance was
determined for the Sun on the basis of 1D LTE model atmosphere. Lines of Zr I
and Zr II give consistent within the error bars non-LTE abundances, while the
difference in LTE abundances amounts to 0.28 dex. The solar abundance of
zirconium obtained with the MAFAGS solar model atmosphere is log eps(Zr) =
2.63+-0.07.

AVOCADO: A Virtual Observatory Census to Address Dwarfs Origins","
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are by far the most abundant of all galaxy types, yet their
properties are still poorly understood -especially due to the observational
challenge that their intrinsic faintness represents. AVOCADO aims at
establishing firm conclusions on their formation and evolution by constructing
a homogeneous, multiwavelength dataset for a statistically significant sample

Virtual Observatory tools, we have built GALEX+SDSS+2MASS spectral energy
distributions that are fitted by a library of single stellar population models.
Star formation rates, stellar masses, ages and metallicities are further
complemented with structural parameters that can be used to classify them
morphologically. This unique dataset, coupled with a detailed characterization
of each dwar's environment, allows for a fully comprehensive investigation of
their origins and to track the (potential) evolutionary paths between the
different dwarf types.

"Title:
The extreme physical properties of the CoRoT-7b super-Earth","
Abstract: The search for rocky exoplanets plays an important role in our quest for
extra-terrestrial life. Here, we discuss the extreme physical properties
possible for the first characterized rocky super-Earth, CoRoT-7b (R_pl = 1.58
\pm 0.10 R_Earth, Mpl = 6.9 \pm 1.2 M_Earth). It is extremely close to its star
(a = 0.0171 AU = 4.48 R_st), with its spin and orbital rotation likely
synchronized. The comparison of its location in the (Mpl, Rpl) plane with the
predictions of planetary models for different compositions points to an
Earth-like composition, even if the error bars of the measured quantities and
the partial degeneracy of the models prevent a definitive conclusion. The
proximity to its star provides an additional constraint on the model. It
implies a high extreme-UV flux and particle wind, and the corresponding
efficient erosion of the planetary atmosphere especially for volatile species
including water. Consequently, we make the working hypothesis that the planet
is rocky with no volatiles in its atmosphere, and derive the physical
properties that result. As a consequence, the atmosphere is made of rocky
vapours with a very low pressure (P \leq 1.5 Pa), no cloud can be sustained,
and no thermalisation of the planetary is expected. The dayside is very hot
(2474 \leq 71 K at the sub-stellar point) while the nightside is very cold (50
to 75 K). The sub-stellar point is as hot as the tungsten filament of an
incandescent bulb, resulting in the melting and distillation of silicate rocks
and the formation of a lava ocean. These possible features of CoRoT-7b could be
common to many small and hot planets, including the recently discovered
Kepler-10b. They define a new class of objects that we propose to name
""Lava-ocean planets"".

Three-dimensional Two-Layer Outer Gap Model: Fermi Energy Dependent  Light Curves of the Vela Pulsar","
Abstract: We extend the two-dimensional two-layer outer gap model to a
three-dimensional geometry and use it to study the high-energy emission of the
Vela pulsar. In this model, the outer gap is divided into two parts, i.e. the
main acceleration region on the top of last-open field lines and the screening
region around the upper boundary of the gap. In the main acceleration region,
the charge density is much lower than the Goldreich-Julian charge density and
the charged particles are accelerated by the electric field along the magnetic
field to emit multi-GeV photons. In the screening region, the charge density is
larger than the Goldreich-Julian value to close the gap and particles in this
region are responsible for multi-100MeV photon emission. We apply this three
dimensional two-layer model to the Vela pulsar and compare the model light
curves, the phase-averaged spectrum and the phase-resolved spectra with the
recent Fermi observations, which also reveals the existence of the third peak
between two main peaks. The phase position of the third peak moves with the
photon energy, which cannot be explained by the geometry of magnetic field
structure and the caustic effects of the photon propagation. We suggest that
the existence of the third peak and its energy dependent movement results from
the azimuthal structure of the outer gap.

Gravitational energy as dark energy: Cosmic structure and apparent  acceleration","
Abstract: Below scales of about 100/h Mpc our universe displays a complex inhomogeneous
structure dominated by voids, with clusters of galaxies in sheets and
filaments. The coincidence that cosmic expansion appears to start accelerating
at the epoch when such structures form has prompted a number of researchers to
question whether dark energy is a signature of a failure of the standard
cosmology to properly account, on average, for the distribution of matter we
observe. Here I discuss the timescape scenario, in which cosmic acceleration is
understood as an apparent effect, due to gravitational energy gradients that
grow when spatial curvature gradients become significant with the nonlinear
growth of cosmic structure. I discuss conceptual issues related to the
averaging problem, and their impact on the calibration of local geometry to the
solutions of the volume-average evolution equations corrected by backreaction,
and the question of nonbaryonic dark matter in the timescape framework. I
further discuss recent work on defining observational tests for average
geometric quantities which can distinguish the timescape model from a
cosmological constant or other models of dark energy.

"Title:
The Basal Chromospheric Mg II h+k Flux of Evolved Stars: Probing the  Energy Dissipation of Giant Chromospheres","
Abstract: Of a total of 177 cool G, K, and M giants and supergiants, we measured the Mg
II h+k line emission of extended chromospheres in high-resolution (LWR) IUE
spectra by using the IUE final data archive at STScI, and derived the
respective stellar surface fluxes. They represent the chromospheric radiative
energy losses presumably related to basal heating by the dissipation of
acoustic waves, plus a highly variable contribution due to magnetic activity.
Thanks to the large sample size, we find a very well defined lower limit, the
basal chromospheric Mg II h+k line flux of cool giant chromospheres, as a
function of T_eff. A total of 16 giants were observed several times, over a
period of up to 20 years. Their respective minimal Mg II h+k line fluxes
confirm the basal flux limit very well because none of their emissions dip
beneath the empirically deduced basal flux line representative for the overall
sample. Based on a total of 15 to 22 objects with very low Mg II h+k emission,
we find as limit: log F_Mg_h+k = 7.33 log T_eff - 21.75 (cgs units; based on
B-V). Within its uncertainties, this is almost the same relation as has been
found in the past for the geometrically much thinner chromospheres of main
sequence stars. Concerning any residual dependence of the basal flux on the
surface gravity it can be stated that over a gravity range of more than four
orders of magnitude (main-sequence stars to supergiants), the basal flux does
not appear to vary by more than a factor of 2. These findings are in good
agreement with the predictions by previous hydrodynamic models of acoustic wave
propagation and energy dissipation, as well as with earlier empirical
determinations. Finally, we discuss the idea that the ample energy flux of the
chromospheric acoustic waves in a cool giant may yield, as a by-product, the
energy flux required by its cool wind (i.e., non-dust-driven, ""Reimers-type""
mass-loss).

"Title:
Light/Mass Offsets in the Lensing Cluster Abell 3827: Evidence for  Collisional Dark Matter?","
Abstract: If dark matter has a non-zero self-interaction cross-section, then dark
matter halos of individual galaxies in cluster cores should experience a drag
force from the ambient dark matter of the cluster, which will not affect the
stellar components of galaxies, and thus will lead to a separation between the
stellar and dark matter. If the cross-section is only a few decades below its
current astrophysically determined upper limit, then kpc-scale separations
should result. However, such separations will be observable only under very
favorable conditions. Abell 3827 is a nearby late stage cluster merger with
four massive central ellipticals within 20 kpc of each other. The ten strong
lensing images tightly surrounding the ellipticals provide an excellent set of
constraints for a free-form lens reconstruction. Our free-form mass maps show a
massive dark extended clump, about 6 kpc from one of the ellipticals. The
robustness of this result has been tested with many reconstructions, and
confirmed with experiments using synthetic lens mass distributions. Interpreted
in terms of dark matter collisionality, our result yields sigma/m ~ 4.5 10^{-7}
(t/10^{10} yr)^{-2} cm^2/g, where t is the merger's age.

Discovery of millisecond pulsars in radio searches of southern Fermi LAT  sources","
Abstract: Using the Parkes radio telescope we have carried out deep observations of
eleven unassociated gamma-ray sources. Periodicity searches of these data have
discovered two millisecond pulsars, PSR J1103-5403 (1FGL J1103.9-5355) and PSR
J2241-5236 (1FGL J2241.9-5236), and a long period pulsar, PSR J1604-44 (1FGL
J1604.7-4443). In addition we searched for but did not detect any radio
pulsations from six gammaray pulsars discovered by the Fermi satellite to a
level of - 0.04 mJy (for pulsars with a 10% duty cycle). Timing of the
millisecond pulsar PSR J1103-5403 has shown that its position is 9' from the
centroid of the gamma-ray source. Since these observations were carried out,
independent evidence has shown that 1FGL J1103.9-5355 is associated with the
flat spectrum radio source PKS 1101-536. It appears certain that the pulsar is
not associated with the gamma-ray source, despite the seemingly low probability
of a chance detection of a radio millisecond pulsar. We consider that PSR
J1604-44 is a chance discovery of a weak, long period pulsar and is unlikely to
be associated with 1FGL J1604.7-4443. PSR J2241-5236 has a spin period of 2.2
ms and orbits a very low mass companion with a 3.5 hour orbital period. The
relatively high flux density and low dispersion measure of PSR J2241-5236 makes
it an excellent candidate for high precision timing experiments. The gamma-rays
of 1FGL J2241.9-5236 have a spectrum that is well modelled by a power law with
exponential cutoff, and phasebinning with the radio ephemeris results in a
multi-peaked gamma-ray pulse profile. Observations with Chandra have identified
a coincident X-ray source within 0.1"" of the position of the pulsar obtained by
radio timing

Abstract: Gravitationally lensed QSOs (GLQs) at redshift z = 1-2 play a key role in
understanding the cosmic evolution of the innermost parts of active galaxies

structure of galaxies at intermediate redshifts. With respect to studies of
normal QSOs, GLQ programmes have several advantages. For example, a monitoring

variations. Both kinds of variations can be used to discuss central engines in
distant QSOs, and mass distributions and compositions of lensing galaxies. In
this context, UV data are of particular interest, since they correspond to
emissions from the immediate surroundings of the supermassive black hole. We

Constraining mixing processes in stellar cores using asteroseismology.  Impact of semiconvection in low-mass stars","
Abstract: The overall evolution of low-mass stars is heavily influenced by the
processes occurring in the stellar interior. In particular, mixing processes in
convectively unstable zones and overshooting regions affect the resulting
observables and main sequence lifetime. We study the effects of different
convective boundary definitions and mixing prescriptions in convective cores of
low-mass stars, to discriminate the existence, size, and evolutionary stage of
the central mixed zone by means of asteroseismology. We implemented the Ledoux
criterion for convection in our stellar evolution code, together with a
time-dependent diffusive approach for mixing of elements when semiconvective
zones are present. We compared models with masses ranging from 1 M* to 2 M*
computed with two different criteria for convective boundary definition and
including different mixing prescriptions within and beyond the formal limits of
the convective regions. Using calculations of adiabatic oscillations
frequencies for a large set of models, we developed an asteroseismic diagnosis
using only l=0 and l=1 modes based on the ratios of small to large separations
r01 and r10 defined by Roxburgh & Vorontsov (2003). These variables are almost
linear in the expected observable frequency range, and we show that their slope
depends simultaneously on the central hydrogen content, the extent of the
convective core, and the amplitude of the sound-speed discontinuity at the core
boundary. By considering about 25 modes and an accuracy in the frequency
determinations as expected from the CoRoT and Kepler missions, the technique we
propose allows us to detect the presence of a convective core and to
discriminate the different sizes of the homogeneously mixed central region
without the need of a strong a priori for the stellar mass.

Abstract: Direct Sun light absorption by trace gases can be used to quantify them and

position sensor closed to the spectrometer is almost always needed. This paper

Detection of X-rays from the symbiotic star V1329 Cyg","
Abstract: We report the detection of X-ray emission from the symbiotic star V1329 Cyg
with XMM-Newton. The spectrum from the EPIC pn, MOS1 and MOS2 instruments
consists of a two-temperature plasma with k T = 0.11 keV and k T = 0.93 keV.
Unlike the vast majority of symbiotic stars detected in X-rays, the soft
component of the spectrum seems to be absorbed only by interstellar material.
The shock velocities corresponding to the observed temperatures are about 300
km/s and about 900 km/s. We did not find either periodic or aperiodic X-ray
variability, with upper limits on the amplitudes of such variations being 46 %
and 16 % (rms), respectively. We also did not find any ultraviolet variability
with an rms amplitude of more than approximately 1 %. The derived velocities
and the unabsorbed nature of the soft component of the X-ray spectrum suggest
that some portion of the high energy emission could originate in shocks within
a jet and beyond the symbiotic nebula. The lower velocity is consistent with
the expansion velocity of the extended structure present in HST observations.
The higher velocity could be associated with an internal shock at the base of
the jet or with shocks in the accretion region.

Characterizing the atmospheres of transiting rocky planets around late  type dwarfs","
Abstract: Visible and near-infrared spectra of transiting hot Jupiter planets have

including important bio-markers such as water, oxygen and methane. Our
simulations using a recently published empirical Earth's transmission spectrum,

dwarfs (Teff < 3100 K). For a twin of Earth around a star with Teff around 3100

dioxide, and oxygen in the wavelength range between 0.9 and 2.4 micron can
simultaneously be detected within a hundred hours of observing time, or even
less for a late-M star. Such detection would constitute a proof for the
existence of life in that planet. The detection time can be reduced to a few
hours for a super-Earth type of planet with twice the Earth's radius.

Characterisation of the CAFOS linear spectro-polarimeter","
Abstract: Aims. This research note presents a full analysis of the CAFOS polarimeter
mounted at the Calar Alto 2.2m telescope. It also provides future users of this
mode with all necessary information to properly correct for instrumental
effects in polarization data obtained with this instrument.
Methods. The standard stars BD+59d389 (polarized) and HD14069 (unpolarized)
were observed with CAFOS in November, 2010, using 16 half-wave plate angles.
The linear spectropolarimetric properties of CAFOS were studied using a Fourier
Analysis of the resulting data.
Results. CAFOS shows a roughly constant instrumental polarization at the
level of ~0.3% between 4000 and 8600 A. Below 4000 A the spurious polarization
grows to reach ~0.7% at 3600 A. This instrumental effect is most likely
produced by the telescope optics, and appears to be additive. The Wollaston
prism presents a clear deviation from the ideal behavior. The problem is
largely removed by the usage of at least 4 retarder plate angles. The
chromatism of the half-wave plate causes a peak-to-peak oscillation of ~11
degrees in the polarization angle. This can be effectively corrected using the
tabulated values presented in this paper. The Fourier analysis shows that the
k!=0,4 harmonics are practically negligible between 3800 and 7400 A.
Conclusions. After correcting for instrumental polarization and retarder
plate chromatism, with 4 half-wave plate angles CAFOS can reach an rms linear
polarization accuracy of about 0.1%.

The specific gauge-flation model we study in this paper has two parameters, a
cutoff scale Lambda and the gauge coupling g. Fitting our results with the
current cosmological data fixes \Lambda\sim 10 H \sim 10^{15} GeV (H is the

Core-collapse explosions of Wolf-Rayet stars and the connection to type  IIb/Ib/Ic supernovae","
Abstract: We present non-LTE time-dependent radiative-transfer simulations of supernova

ejecta, with and without 56Ni, produced from single and binary Wolf-Rayet (W-R)
stars evolved at solar and sub-solar metallicities. Our bolometric light curves
show a 10-day long post-breakout plateau with a luminosity of 1-5x10^7Lsun. In
our 56Ni-rich models, with ~3Msun ejecta masses, this plateau precedes a
20-30-day long re-brightening phase initiated by the outward-diffusing heat
wave powered by radioactive decay at depth. In low ejecta-mass models with
moderate mixing, Gamma-ray leakage starts as early as ~50d after explosion and
causes the nebular luminosity to steeply decline by ~0.02mag/d. Such
signatures, which are observed in standard SNe IIb/Ib/Ic, are consistent with
low-mass progenitors derived from a binary-star population. We propose that the
majority of stars with an initial mass ~<20Msun yield SNe II-P if 'effectively""
single, SNe IIb/Ib/Ic if part of a close binary system, and SN-less black holes
if more massive. Our ejecta, with outer hydrogen mass fractions as low as
~>0.01 and a total hydrogen mass of ~>0.001Msun, yield the characteristic SN
IIb spectral morphology at early times. However, by ~15d after the explosion,
only Halpha may remain as a weak absorption feature. Our binary models,
characterised by helium surface mass fractions of ~>0.85, systematically show
HeI lines during the post-breakout plateau, irrespective of the 56Ni abundance.
Synthetic spectra show a strong sensitivity to metallicity, which offers the

Observational Cosmology And The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation","
Abstract: We study the validity of cosmic distance duality relation between angular
diameter and luminosity distances. To test this duality relation we use the
latest Union2 Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) data for estimating the luminosity
distance. The estimation of angular diameter distance comes from the samples of

distance duality relation as a function of redshift in six different ways. Our
results rule out some of the parameterizations significantly.

Conditional Probabilities in the Excursion Set Theory. Generic Barriers  and non-Gaussian Initial Conditions","
Abstract: The excursion set theory, where density perturbations evolve stochastically
with the smoothing scale, provides a method for computing the dark matter halo
mass function. The computation of the mass function is mapped into the
so-called first-passage time problem in the presence of a moving barrier. The
excursion set theory is also a powerful formalism to study other properties of
dark matter halos such as halo bias, accretion rate, formation time, merging
rate and the formation history of halos. This is achieved by computing
conditional probabilities with non-trivial initial conditions, and the
conditional two-barrier first-crossing rate. In this paper we use the path
integral formulation of the excursion set theory to calculate analytically
these conditional probabilities in the presence of a generic moving barrier,
including the one describing the ellipsoidal collapse, and for both Gaussian
and non-Gaussian initial conditions. While most of our analysis associated with
Gaussian initial conditions assumes Markovianity (top-hat in momentum space
smoothing, rather than generic filters), the non-Markovianity of the random
walks induced by non-Gaussianity is consistently accounted for. We compute, for
a generic barrier, the first two scale-independent halo bias parameters, the
conditional mass function and the halo formation time probability, including
the effects of non-Gaussianities. We also provide the expression for the
two-constant-barrier first-crossing rate when non-Markovian effects are induced
by a top-hat filter function in real space.

Abstract: We present a short history of the TAUVEX instrument, conceived to provide
multi-band wide-field imaging in the ultraviolet, emphasizing the lack of
sufficient and aggressive support on the part of the different space agencies

was dismounted from its agreed-upon platform. This proved to be beneficial,
since GSAT-4 and its launcher were lost on April 15 2010 due to the failure of
the carrier rocket's 3rd stage. TAUVEX is now stored in ISRO's clean room in
Bangalore with no firm indications when or on what platform it might be

Densitometry and Thermometry of Starburst Galaxies","
Abstract: With a goal toward deriving the physical conditions in external galaxies, we
present a survey of formaldehyde (H2CO) and ammonia (NH3) emission and
absorption in a sample of starburst galaxies using the Green Bank Telescope. By
extending well-established techniques used to derive the spatial density in
star formation regions in our own Galaxy, we show how the relative intensity of
the 1(10)-1(11) and 2(11)-2(12) K-doublet transitions of H2CO can provide an
accurate densitometer for the active star formation environments found in
starburst galaxies (c.f. Mangum et al. 2008). Similarly, we employ the
well-established technique of using the relative intensities of the (1,1),
(2,2), and (4,4) transitions of NH3 to derive the kinetic temperature in
starburst galaxies. Our measurements of the kinetic temperature constrained
spatial density in our starburst galaxy sample represent the first mean density
measurements made toward starburst galaxies. We note a disparity between
kinetic temperature measurements derived assuming direct coupling to dust and
those derived from our NH3 measurements which points to the absolute need for
direct gas kinetic temperature measurements using an appropriate molecular
probe. Finally, our spatial density measurements point to a rough constancy to
the spatial density (10^{4.5} to 10^{5.5} cm^{-3}) in our starburst galaxy
sample. This implies that the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation between L_{IR} and
M_{dense}: (1) Is a measure of the dense gas mass reservoir available to form
stars, and (2) Is not directly dependent upon a higher average density driving
the star formation process in the most luminous starburst galaxies.

"Title:
Propagating intensity disturbances in polar corona as seen from AIA/SDO","
Abstract: Polar corona is often explored to find the energy source for the acceleration
of the fast solar wind. Earlier observations show omni-presence of
quasi-periodic disturbances, travelling outward, which is believed to be caused
by the ubiquitous presence of outward propagating waves. These waves, mostly of
compressional type, might provide the additional momentum and heat required for
the fast solar wind acceleration. It has been conjectured that these
disturbances are not due to waves but high speed plasma outflows, which are
difficult to distinguish using the current available techniques. With the
unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution of AIA, we search for these
quasi-periodic disturbances in both plume and interplume regions of the polar
corona. We investigate their nature of propagation and search for a plausible
interpretation. We also aim to study their multi-thermal nature by using three
different coronal passbands of AIA. In almost all the locations chosen, in both
plume and interplume regions we find the presence of propagating quasi-periodic
disturbances, of periodicities ranging from 10-30 min. These are clearly seen
in two channels and in a few cases out to very large distances (~250 arcsec)
off-limb, almost to the edge of the AIA field of view. The propagation speeds
are in the range of 100-170 km/s. The average speeds are different for
different passbands and higher in interplume regions. Observed disturbances are
insensitive to changes in slit width. This indicates that a coherent mechanism
is involved. In addition, the observed propagation speed varies between the
different passpands, implying that these quasi-periodic intensity disturbances
are possibly due to magneto-acoustic waves. The propagation speeds in
interplume region are higher than in the plume region.

"Title:
Shock Breakout in Type II Plateau Supernovae: Prospects for High  Redshift Supernova Surveys","
Abstract: Shock breakout is the brightest radiative phenomenon in a supernova (SN) but
is difficult to be observed owing to the short duration and X-ray/ultraviolet
(UV)-peaked spectra. After the first observation from the rising phase reported
in 2008, its observability at high redshift is attracting enormous attention.
We perform multigroup radiation hydrodynamics calculations of explosions for
evolutionary presupernova models with various main-sequence masses $M_{\rm
MS}$, metallicities $Z$, and explosion energies $E$. We present multicolor
light curves of shock breakout in Type II plateau SNe, being the most frequent
core-collapse SNe, and predict apparent multicolor light curves of shock
breakout at various redshifts $z$. We derive the observable SN rate and
reachable redshift as functions of filter $x$ and limiting magnitude $m_{x,{\rm
lim}}$ by taking into account an initial mass function, cosmic star formation
history, intergalactic absorption, and host galaxy extinction. We propose a
realistic survey strategy optimized for shock breakout. For example, the
$g'$-band observable SN rate for $m_{g',{\rm lim}}=27.5$ mag is 3.3 SNe
degree$^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$ and a half of them locates at $z\geq1.2$. It is clear
that the shock breakout is a beneficial clue to probe high-$z$ core-collapse
SNe. We also establish ways to identify shock breakout and constrain SN
properties from the observations of shock breakout, brightness, time scale, and
color. We emphasize that the multicolor observations in blue optical bands with
$\sim$ hour intervals, preferably over $\geq2$ continuous nights, are essential
to efficiently detect, identify, and interpret shock breakout.

Magnetic fields and differential rotation on the pre-main sequence III:  The early-G star HD 106506","
Abstract: We present photometry and spectropolarimetry of the pre-main sequence star HD
106506. A photometric rotational period of ~1.416 +/- 0.133 days has been
derived using observations at Mount Kent Observatory (MKO). Spectropolarimetric
data taken at the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) were used to derive
spot occupancy and magnetic maps of the star through the technique of Zeeman
Doppler imaging (ZDI). The resulting brightness maps indicate that HD 106506
displays photospheric spots at all latitudes including a predominant polar
spot. Azimuthal and radial magnetic images of this star have been derived, and
a significant azimuthal magnetic field is indicated, in line with other active
young stars. A solar-like differential rotation law was incorporated into the
imaging process. Using Stokes I information the equatorial rotation rate,
$\Omega_{eq}$, was found to be 4.54 +/- 0.01 rad/d, with a photospheric shear
$\delta\Omega$ of $0.21_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$ rad/d. This equates to an equatorial
rotation period of ~1.39 +/- 0.01 days, with the equatorial region lapping the
poles every ~$30_{-3}^{+5}$ days. Using the magnetic features, the equatorial
rotation rate, $\Omega_{eq}$, was found to be 4.51 +/- 0.01 rad/d, with a
photospheric shear $\delta\Omega$ of 0.24 +/- 0.03 rad/d. This differential
rotation is approximately 4 times that observed on the Sun.

"Title:
Evolution of the binary population in young dense star clusters","
Abstract: Context: Field stars are not always single stars, but can often be found in
bound double systems. Since binary frequencies in the birth places of stars,
young embedded clusters, are sometimes even higher than on average the question
arises of how binary stars form in young dense star clusters and how their
properties evolve to those observed in the field population.
Aims: We assess, the influence of stellar dynamical interactions on the
primordial binary population in young dense cluster environments.
Methods: We perform numerical N-body simulations of the Orion Nebula Cluster
like star cluster models including primordial binary populations using the
simulation code nbody6++.
Results: We find two remarkable results that have yet not been reported: The
first is that the evolution of the binary frequency in young dense star
clusters is independent predictably of its initial value. The time evolution of
the normalized number of binary systems has a fundamental shape. The second
main result is that the mass of the primary star is of vital importance to the
evolution of the binary. The more massive a primary star, the lower the
probability that the binary is destroyed by gravitational interactions. This
results in a higher binary frequency for stars more massive than $2\Msun$
compared to the binary frequency of lower mass stars. The observed increase in
the binary frequency with primary mass is therefore most likely not due to
differences in the formation process but can be entirely explained as a
dynamical effect.
Conclusions: Our results allow us to draw conclusions about the past and the
future number of binary systems in young dense star clusters and demonstrate
that the present field stellar population has been influenced significantly by
its natal environments.

Equilateral Non-Gaussianity and New Physics on the Horizon","
Abstract: We examine the effective theory of single-field inflation in the limit where
the scalar perturbations propagate with a small speed of sound. In this case
the non-linearly realized time-translation symmetry of the Lagrangian implies
large interactions, giving rise to primordial non-Gaussianities. When the
non-Gaussianities are measurable, these interactions will become strongly
coupled unless new physics appears close to the Hubble scale. Due to its
proximity to the Hubble scale, the new physics is not necessarily decoupled
from inflationary observables and can potentially affect the predictions of the
model. To understand the types of corrections that may arise, we construct
weakly-coupled completions of the theory and study their observational
signatures.

The influence of electron collisions on non-LTE Li line formation in  stellar atmospheres","
Abstract: The influence of the uncertainties in the rate coefficient data for
electron-impact excitation and ionization on non-LTE Li line formation in cool
stellar atmospheres is investigated. We examine the electron collision data
used in previous non-LTE calculations and compare them to recent calculations
that use convergent close-coupling (CCC) techniques and to our own calculations
using the R-matrix with pseudostates (RMPS) method. We find excellent agreement
between rate coefficients from the CCC and RMPS calculations, and reasonable
agreement between these data and the semi-empirical data used in non-LTE
calculations up to now. The results of non-LTE calculations using the old and
new data sets are compared and only small differences found: about 0.01 dex (~
2%) or less in the abundance corrections. We therefore conclude that the
influence on non-LTE calculations of uncertainties in the electron collision
data is negligible. Indeed, together with the collision data for the charge
exchange process Li(3s) + H <-> Li^+ + H^- now available, and barring the
existence of an unknown important collisional process, the collisional data in
general is not a source of significant uncertainty in non-LTE Li line formation
calculations.

Observational constraints on inhomogeneous cosmological models without  dark energy","
Abstract: It has been proposed that the observed dark energy can be explained away by
the effect of large-scale nonlinear inhomogeneities. In the present paper we
discuss how observations constrain cosmological models featuring large voids.
We start by considering Copernican models, in which the observer is not
occupying a special position and homogeneity is preserved on a very large
scale. We show how these models, at least in their current realizations, are
constrained to give small, but perhaps not negligible in certain contexts,
corrections to the cosmological observables. We then examine non-Copernican
models, in which the observer is close to the center of a very large void.
These models can give large corrections to the observables which mimic an
accelerated FLRW model. We carefully discuss the main observables and tests
able to exclude them.

The Effect of Helium Sedimentation on Galaxy Cluster Masses and Scaling  Relations","
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies predict that the inner regions of galaxy clusters
may have an enhanced helium abundance due to sedimentation over the cluster
lifetime. If sedimentation is not suppressed (e.g., by tangled magnetic
fields), this may significantly affect the cluster mass estimates. We use
Chandra X-ray observations of eight relaxed galaxy clusters to investigate the
upper limits to the effect of helium sedimentation on the measurement of
cluster masses and the best-fit slopes of the Y_X - M_500 and Y_X - M_2500
scaling relations. We calculated gas mass and total mass in two limiting cases:
a uniform, un-enhanced abundance distribution and a radial distribution from
numerical simulations of helium sedimentation on a timescale of 11 Gyrs. The
assumed helium sedimentation model, on average, produces a negligible increase
in the gas mass inferred within large radii (r < r500) (1.3 +/- 1.2 per cent)
and a (10.2 +/- 5.5) per cent mean decrease in the total mass inferred within r
< r500. Significantly stronger effects in the gas mass (10.5 +/- 0.8 per cent)
and total mass (25.1 +/- 1.1 per cent) are seen at small radii owing to a
larger variance in helium abundance in the inner region, r < 0.1 r500. We find
that the slope of the Y_X -M_500 scaling relation is not significantly affected
by helium sedimentation.

Abstract: Lusignoli and Vignati have recently pointed out that it is in principle
possible to directly detect the cosmic antineutrino background by using the

this paper we calculate the rate of the relic antineutrino capture on
holmium-163 nuclei against the corresponding EC decay rate by taking account of
different neutrino mass hierarchies and reasonable values of theta_13. We show
that such flavor effects are appreciable and even important in some cases, and
stress that a calorimetric measurement of the cosmic antineutrino background
might be feasible in the far future.

Confirmation of Enhanced Dwarf-sensitive Absorption Features in the  Spectra of Massive Elliptical Galaxies: Further Evidence for a Non-universal  Initial Mass Function","
Abstract: We recently found that massive cluster elliptical galaxies have strong Na I
8183,8195 and FeH 9916 Wing-Ford band absorption, indicating the presence of a
very large population of stars with masses <~ 0.3 M_sun. Here we test this
result by comparing the elliptical galaxy spectra to those of luminous globular
clusters associated with M31. These globular clusters have similar
metallicities, abundance ratios and ages as massive elliptical galaxies but
their low dynamical mass-to-light ratios rule out steep stellar initial mass
functions (IMFs). From high quality Keck spectra we find that the
dwarf-sensitive absorption lines in globular clusters are significantly weaker
than in elliptical galaxies, and consistent with normal IMFs. The differences
in the Na I and Wing-Ford indices are 0.027 +- 0.007 mag and 0.017 +- 0.006 mag
respectively. We directly compare the two classes of objects by subtracting the
averaged globular cluster spectrum from the averaged elliptical galaxy
spectrum. The difference spectrum is well fit by the difference between a
stellar population synthesis model with a bottom-heavy IMF and one with a
bottom-light IMF. We speculate that the slope of the IMF may vary with velocity
dispersion, although it is not yet clear what physical mechanism would be
responsible for such a relation.

Feedback in Luminous Obscured Quasars","
Abstract: We use spatially resolved long-slit spectroscopy from Magellan to investigate
the extent, kinematics, and ionization structure in the narrow-line regions of
15 luminous, obscured quasars with z<0.5. Increasing the dynamic range in
luminosity by an order of magnitude, as well as improving the depth of existing
observations by a similar factor, we revisit relations between narrow-line
region size and the luminosity and linewidth of the narrow emission lines. We
find a slope of 0.22 +/- 0.04 for the power-law relationship between size and
luminosity, suggesting that the nebulae are limited by availability of gas to
ionize at these luminosities. In fact, we find that the active galactic nucleus
is effectively ionizing the interstellar medium over the full extent of the
host galaxy. Broad (~300-1000 km/s) linewidths across the galaxies reveal that
the gas is kinematically disturbed. Furthermore, the rotation curves and
velocity dispersions of the ionized gas remain constant out to large distances,
in striking contrast to normal and starburst galaxies. We argue that the gas in
the entire host galaxy is significantly disturbed by the central active
galactic nucleus. While only ~10^7-10^8 M_sun worth of gas are directly
observed to be leaving the host galaxies at or above their escape velocities,
these estimates are likely lower limits because of the biases in both mass and
outflow velocity measurements and may in fact be in accord with expectations
from recent feedback models. Additionally, we report the discovery of two dual
obscured quasars, one of which is blowing a large-scale (~10 kpc) bubble of
ionized gas into the intergalactic medium.

Magnetic flux generation and transport in cool stars","
Abstract: The Sun and other cool stars harbouring outer convection zones manifest
magnetic activity in their atmospheres. The connection between this activity
and the properties of a deep-seated dynamo generating the magnetic flux is not
well understood. By employing physical models, we study the spatial and
temporal characteristics of the observable surface field for various stellar
parameters. We combine models for magnetic flux generation, buoyancy
instability, and transport, which encompass the entire convection zone. The
model components are: (1) a thin-layer alpha-Omega dynamo at the base of the
convection zone; (2) buoyancy instabilities and the rise of flux tubes through
the convection zone in 3D, which provides a physically consistent determination
of emergence latitudes and tilt angles; and (3) horizontal flux transport at
the surface. For solar-type stars and rotation periods longer than about 10
days, the latitudinal dynamo waves generated by the deep-seated alpha-Omega
dynamo are faithfully reflected by the surface distribution of magnetic flux.
For rotation periods of the order of two days, however, Coriolis acceleration
of rising flux loops leads to surface flux emergence at much higher latitudes
than the dynamo waves at the bottom of the convection zone reach. A similar
result is found for a K0V star with a rotation period of two days. In the case
of a rapidly rotating K1 subgiant, overlapping dynamo waves lead to noisy
activity cycles and mixed-polarity fields at high latitudes.

The emission line near 1319 A in solar and stellar spectra","
Abstract: An emission line near 1319 A is one of the strongest unidentified lines in
the ultraviolet spectra of cool dwarf stars. In most line lists it is
identified as a transition in N I, although its intensity would then be
anomalous and the observed wavelength does not fit precisely that expected for
N I. The line is also observed in cool giant stars. The measured wavelength of
the line in stellar spectra is 1318.94 (+,- 0.01) A. Observations of giant
stars provide further evidence that this line is not due to N I. It is proposed
that this line is a decay from a previously unknown level in S I, which lies
above the first ionization limit. This is identified with the 3d singlet D (odd
parity) term. The previous tentative assignment of this term to the S I line at
1309.3 A then needs to be revised. The 1309.3 A line has been identified here
for the first time in an astrophysical source. The singlet D (odd parity) level
could, in principle, be populated by collisions from nearby autoionizing levels
that have large number-densities, through population by di-electronic capture.
Spin-orbit interaction with the autoionizing triplet D (odd parity) term might
also lead to di-electronic capture into the singlet D (odd parity) level. A
line at 1309.87 A observed in cool giant stars is identified as a transition in
P II, pumped by the O I resonance lines.

Gamma-ray emission of accelerated particles escaping a supernova remnant  in a molecular cloud","
Abstract: We present a model of gamma-ray emission from core-collapse supernovae
originating from the explosions of massive young stars. The fast forward shock
of the supernova remnant (SNR) can accelerate particles by diffusive shock
acceleration (DSA) in a cavern blown by a strong, pre-supernova stellar wind.
As a fundamental part of nonlinear DSA, some fraction of the accelerated
particles escape the shock and interact with a surrounding massive dense shell
producing hard photon emission. To calculate this emission, we have developed a
new Monte Carlo technique for propagating the cosmic rays (CRs) produced by the
forward shock of the SNR, into the dense, external material. This technique is
incorporated in a hydrodynamic model of an evolving SNR which includes the
nonlinear feedback of CRs on the SNR evolution, the production of escaping CRs
along with those that remain trapped within the remnant, and the broad-band
emission of radiation from trapped and escaping CRs. While our combined
CR-hydro-escape model is quite general and applies to both core collapse and
thermonuclear supernovae, the parameters we choose for our discussion here are
more typical of SNRs from very massive stars whose emission spectra differ
somewhat from those produced by lower mass progenitors directly interacting
with a molecular cloud.

Aberrating the CMB sky: fast and accurate computation of the aberration  kernel","
Abstract: It is well known that our motion with respect to the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) rest frame introduces a large dipolar CMB anisotropy, with an
amplitude ~beta=v/c~10^{-3}. In addition it should lead to a small breaking of
statistical isotropy which becomes most notable at higher multipoles. In
principle this could be used to determine our velocity with respect to the CMB
rest frame using high angular resolution data from Planck, without directly
relying on the amplitude and direction of the CMB dipole, allowing us to
constrain cosmological models in which the cosmic dipole arises partly from
large-scale isocurvature perturbations instead of being fully motion-induced.
Here we derive simple recursion relations that allow precise computation of the
motion-induced coupling between different spherical harmonic coefficients.
Although the lowest order approximations for the coupling kernel can be
deficient by factors of 2-5 at multipoles l~1000-3000, using our results for
the aberration kernel we explicitly confirm that for a statistical detection of
the aberration effect only first order terms in beta matter. However, the
expressions given here are not restricted to beta~10^{-3}, but can be used at
much higher velocities. We demonstrate the robustness of these formulae,
illustrating the dependence of the kernel on beta, as well as the spherical
harmonic indices l and m.

known as Gl 581g, has been estimated to be between 3.1 and 4.3 Earth masses. In
this study, we investigate the habitability of Gl 581g based on a previously
used concept that explores its long-term possibility of photosynthetic biomass
production, which has already been used to gauge the principal possibility of
life regarding the super-Earths Gl 581c and Gl 581d. Methods: A thermal
evolution model for super-Earths is used to calculate the sources and sinks of
atmospheric carbon dioxide. The habitable zone is determined by the limits of
photosynthetic biological productivity on the planetary surface. Models with
different ratios of land / ocean coverage are pursued. Results: The maximum
time span for habitable conditions is attained for water worlds at a position
of about 0.14+/-0.015 AU, which deviates by just a few percent (depending on
the adopted stellar luminosity) from the actual position of Gl 581g, an
estimate that does however not reflect systematic uncertainties inherent in our
model. Therefore, in the framework of our model an almost perfect Goldilock
position is realized. The existence of habitability is found to critically
depend on the relative planetary continental area, lending a considerable
advantage to the possibility of life if Gl 581g's ocean coverage is relatively
high. Conclusions: Our results are a further step toward identifying the
possibility of life beyond the Solar System, especially concerning super-Earth
planets, which appear to be more abundant than previously surmised.

Identifying A Stars in the CoRoT Fields IRa01, LRa01 and LRa02","
Abstract: Up to now, planet search programs have concentrated on main sequence stars
later than spectral type F5. However, identifying planets of early type stars
would be interesting. For example, the mass loss of planets orbiting early and
late type stars is different because of the differences of the EUV and X-ray
radiation of the host stars. As an initial step, we carried out a program to
identify suitable A-stars in the CoRoT fields using spectra taken with the
AAOmega spectrograph. In total we identified 562 A-stars in IRa01, LRa01, and
LRa02.

Off-Axis Afterglow Light Curves from High-Resolution Hydrodynamical Jet  Simulations","
Abstract: Numerical jet simulations serve a valuable role in calculating gamma-ray
burst afterglow emission beyond analytical approximations. Here we present the
results of high resolution 2D simulations of decelerating relativistic jets
performed using the RAM adaptive mesh refinement relativistic hydrodynamics
code. We have applied a separate synchrotron radiation code to the simulation
results in order to calculate light curves at frequencies varying from radio to
X-ray for observers at various angles from the jet axis. We provide a
confirmation from radio light curves from simulations rather than from a
simplified jet model for earlier results in the literature finding that only a
very small number of local Ibc supernovae can possibly harbor an orphan
afterglow.
Also, recent studies have noted an unexpected lack of observed jet breaks in
the Swift sample. Using a jet simulation with physical parameters
representative for an average Swift sample burst, such as a jet half opening
angle of 0.1 rad and a source redshift of z = 2.23, we have created synthetic
light curves at 1.5 keV with artificial errors while accounting for Swift
instrument biases as well. A large set of these light curves have been
generated and analyzed using a Monte Carlo approach. Single and broken power
law fits are compared. We find that for increasing observer angle, the jet
break quickly becomes hard to detect. This holds true even when the observer
remains well within the jet opening angle. We find that the odds that a Swift
light curve from a randomly oriented 0.1 radians jet at z = 2.23 will exhibit a
jet break at the 3 sigma level are only 12 percent. The observer angle
therefore provides a natural explanation for the lack of perceived jet breaks
in the Swift sample.

Binary Formation in Planetesimal Disks I. Equal Mass Planetesimals","
Abstract: As to April 2010, 48 TNO (trans-Neptunian Object) binaries have been found.
This is about 6% of known TNOs. However, in previous theoretical studies of
planetary formation in the TNO region, the effect of binary formation has been
neglected. TNO binaries can be formed through a variety of mechanisms, such as
three-body process, dynamical friction on two massive bodies, inelastic
collisions between two bodies etc. Most of these mechanisms become more
effective as the distance from the Sun increases. In this paper, we studied
three-body process using direct N-body simulations. We systematically changed
the distance from the Sun, the number density of planetesimals, and the radius
of the planetesimals and studied the effect of the binaries on the collision
rate of planetesimals. In the TNO region, binaries are involved in 1/3 - 1/2 of
collisions, and the collision rate is increased by about a factor of a few
compared to the theoretical estimate for the direct two-body collisions. Thus,
it is possible that the binaries formed through three-body process
significantly enhance the collision rate and reduce the growth time scale. In
the terrestrial planet region, binaries are less important, because the ratio
between the Hill radius and physical size of the planetesimals is relatively
small. Although the time scale of our simulations is short, they clearly
demonstrated that the accretion process in the TNO region is quite different
from that in the terrestrial planet region. Simulations which cover longer time
scale are required to obtain more accurate estimate for the accretion
enhancement.

"Title:
A Model for the Sources of the Slow Solar Wind","
Abstract: Models for the origin of the slow solar wind must account for two seemingly
contradictory observations: The slow wind has the composition of the closed
field corona, implying that it originates from the continuous opening and
closing of flux at the boundary between open and closed field. On the other
hand, the slow wind also has large angular width, up to ~ 60{\circ}, suggesting
that its source extends far from the open-closed boundary. We propose a model
that can explain both observations. The key idea is that the source of the slow
wind at the Sun is a network of narrow (possibly singular) open-field corridors
that map to a web of separatrices and quasi-separatrix layers in the
heliosphere. We compute analytically the topology of an open-field corridor and
show that it produces a quasi-separatrix layer in the heliosphere that extends
to angles far from the heliospheric current sheet. We then use an MHD code and
MDI/SOHO observations of the photospheric magnetic field to calculate
numerically, with high spatial resolution, the quasi-steady solar wind and
magnetic field for a time period preceding the August 1, 2008 total solar
eclipse. Our numerical results imply that, at least for this time period, a web
of separatrices (which we term an S-web) forms with sufficient density and
extent in the heliosphere to account for the observed properties of the slow
wind. We discuss the implications of our S-web model for the structure and
dynamics of the corona and heliosphere, and propose further tests of the model.

Low Mass Dark Matter and Invisible Higgs Width In Darkon Models","
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) plus a real gauge-singlet scalar field dubbed darkon
(SM+D) is the simplest model possessing a weakly interacting massive particle
(WIMP) dark-matter candidate. In this model, the parameters are constrained
from dark matter relic density and direct searches. The fact that interaction
between darkon and SM particles is only mediated by Higgs boson exchange may
lead to significant modifications to the Higgs boson properties. If the dark
matter mass is smaller than a half of the Higgs boson mass, the Higgs boson can
decay into a pair of darkons resulting in a large invisible branching ratio.
The Higgs boson will be searched for at the LHC and may well be discovered in
the near future. If a Higgs boson with a small invisible decay width will be
found, the SM+D model with small dark matter mass will be in trouble. We find
that by extending the SM+D to a two-Higgs-doublet model plus a darkon (THDM+D)
it is possible to have a Higgs boson with a small invisible branching ratio and
at the same time the dark matter can have a low mass. We also comment on other
implications of this model.

Recoiled star clusters in the Milky Way halo: N-body simulations and a  candidate search through SDSS","
Abstract: During the formation of the Milky Way, > 100 central black holes (BHs) may
have been ejected from their small host galaxies as a result of asymmetric
gravitational wave emission. We previously showed that many of these BHs are
surrounded by a compact cluster of stars that remained bound to the BH during
the ejection process. In this paper, we perform long term N-body simulations of
these star clusters to determine the distribution of stars in these clusters
today. These numerical simulations, reconciled with our Fokker-Planck
simulations, show that stellar density profile follows a power-law with slope ~
-2.15, and show that large angle scattering and tidal disruptions remove 20 -
90% of the stars by ~10^10 yr. We then analyze the photometric and
spectroscopic properties of recoiled clusters accounting for the small number
of stars in the clusters. We use our results to perform a systematic search for
candidates in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find no spectroscopic
candidates, in agreement with our expectations from the completeness of the
survey. Using generic photometric models of present day clusters we identify
~100 recoiling cluster candidates. Follow-up spectroscopy would be able to
determine the nature of these candidates.

"Title:
A transmission electron microscopy study of presolar hibonite","
Abstract: We report isotopic and microstructural data on five presolar hibonite grains
identified in an acid residue of the Krymka LL3.1 ordinary chondrite. Isotopic
measurements by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) verified a presolar
circumstellar origin for the grains. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
examination of the crystal structure and chemistry of the grains was enabled by
in situ sectioning and lift-out with a focused-ion-beam scanning-electron
microscope. Comparisons of isotopic compositions with models indicate that four
of the five grains formed in low-mass stars that evolved through the
red-giant/asymptotic-giant branches, whereas one grain formed in the ejecta of
a Type II supernova. Selected-area electron-diffraction patterns show that all
grains are single crystals of hibonite. Some grains contain stacking faults and
small spreads in orientation that can be attributed to a combination of growth
defects and mechanical processing by grain-grain collisions. The similar
structure of the supernova grain to those from RGB/AGB stars indicates a
similarity in the formation conditions. Radiation damage, if present, occurs
below our detection limit. Of the five grains we studied, only one has the pure
hibonite composition of CaAl12O19. All others contain minor amounts of Mg, Si,
Ti, and Fe. The microstructural data are generally consistent with theoretical
predictions, which constrain the circumstellar condensation temperature to a
range of 1480 K to 1743 K, assuming a corresponding total gas pressure between
1 x 10-3 and 1 x 10-6 atm. The TEM data were used to develop a calibration for
SIMS determination of Ti contents in oxide grains. Grains with extreme 18O
depletions, indicating deep mixing has occurred in their parent AGB stars, are
slightly Ti-enriched compared to grains from stars without deep mixing, most
likely reflecting differences in grain condensation conditions.

"Title:
Characteristics of thick disks formed through minor mergers: stellar  excesses and scale lengths","
Abstract: By means of N-body/SPH simulations we investigate the morphological
properties of thick disks formed through minor mergers. We show that the
vertical surface density profile of the post-merger thick disk follows a sech
function and has an excess in the regions far from the disk mid-plane (z>2kpc).
This stellar excess also follows a sech function with a larger scale height
than the main thick disk component, and it is usually dominated by stars from
the primary galaxy. Stars in the excess have a rotational velocity lower than
that of stars in the thick disk, and they may thus be confused with stars in
the inner galactic halo. The thick disk scale height increases with radius and
the rate of its increase is smaller for more gas rich primary galaxies. On the
contrary, the scale height of the stellar excess is independent of both radius
and gas fraction. We also find that the post-merger thick disk has a radial
scale length which is 10-50% larger than that of the thin disk. Two consecutive
mergers have basically the same effect on heating the stellar disk as a single
merger of the same total mass. To investigate how thick disks produced through
secular processes may differ from those produced by minor mergers, we also
simulated gravitationally unstable gas-rich disks. These disks do not produce
either a stellar excess or a ratio of thick to thin disk scale lengths greater
than one. Our simulation results are consistent with observations of the ratio
of thick to thin disk scale lengths of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, and
with the Toomre diagram of the Milky Way. We conclude that minor mergers are a
viable mechanism for the creation of galactic thick disks and investigating
stars at several kpc above the mid-plane of the Milky Way and other galaxies
may provide a quantitative method for studying the minor merger history of
galaxies.

Off-Fermi Shell Nucleons in Superdense Asymmetric Nuclear Matter","
Abstract: Recent observations of the strong dominance of proton-neutron (pn) relative
to pp and nn short-range correlations (SRCs) in nuclei indicate on possibility
of unique new condition for asymmetric high density nuclear matter, in which
the pp and nn interactions are suppressed while the pn interactions are
enhanced due to tensor interaction. We demonstrate that for sufficiently
asymmetric case and high densities the momentum distribution of the smaller
p-component is strongly deformed with protons increasingly populating the
momentum states beyond the Fermi surface. This result is obtained by extracting
the probabilities of two-nucleon (2N) SRCs from the analysis of the
experimental data on high momentum transfer inclusive electro-nuclear
reactions. We fitted the extracted probabilities as a function of nuclear
density and asymmetry and used the fit to estimate the fractions of the
off-Fermi shell nucleons in the superdense nuclear matter relevant to neutron
stars. Our results indicate that starting at three nuclear saturation densities
the protons with fractional densities 1/9 will populate mostly the high
momentum tail of the momentum distribution while only 2% of the neutrons will
do so. We discuss the implications of this condition for neutron stars and
emphasize that it may be characteristic to any asymmetric two component Fermi
system with suppressed central and enhanced short-range tensor interactions
between the two components.

Abstract: Mirror matter is a stable self-collisional dark matter candidate. If parity

obeying the same physical laws as our (visible) sector, except for the opposite

gravity, therefore mirror matter is naturally ""dark"". Here I review the
cosmological signatures of mirror dark matter, concerning thermodynamics of the
early Universe, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, primordial structure formation and
evolution, cosmic microwave background and large scale structure power spectra.
Besides gravity, the effects on primordial nucleosynthesis of the kinetic
mixing between photons and mirror photons are considered. Summarizing the
present status of research and comparing theoretical results with
observations/experiments, it emerges that mirror matter is not just a viable,
but a promising dark matter candidate.

The SAURON project - XVIII. The integrated UV-linestrength relations of  early-type galaxies","
Abstract: Using far (FUV) and near (NUV) ultraviolet photometry from guest investigator
programmes on the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite, optical
photometry from the MDM Observatory and optical integral-field spectroscopy
from SAURON, we explore the UV-linestrength relations of the 48 nearby
early-type galaxies in the SAURON sample. Identical apertures are used for all
quantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. We show that galaxies with purely old
stellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated FUV-V and
FUV-NUV colours with the integrated Mgb and Hbeta absorption linestrength
indices, strongest for FUV-NUV. Correlations with the NUV-V colour, Fe5015
index and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. These correlations put
stringent constraints on the origin of the UV-upturn phenomenon in early-type
galaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. In particular,
despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between FUV-V colour
and Mg linestrength originally publicised by Burstein et al. (1988), which we
refer to as the ""Burstein relation"", suggesting a positive dependence of the
UV-upturn on metallicity. We argue that the scatter in the correlations is
real, and present mild evidence that a strong UV excess is preferentially
present in slow-rotating galaxies. We also demonstrate that most outliers in
the correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some at
very low levels. We believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,
afforded by the deep and varied data available for the SAURON sample, explains
why our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallower
surveys. This is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sample
of more distant early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),
more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

include the effects of quadratic removal, irregular sampling, and variable
errors which exacerbate the spectral leakage inherent in estimating the steep
red spectrum of the gravitational-wave background. These observations are found
to be consistent with the null hypothesis, that no gravitational-wave
background is present, with 76 percent confidence. We show that the detection
statistic is dominated by the contributions of only a few pulsars because of
the inhomogeneity of this data set. The issues of detecting the signature of a

Extreme high energy proton-gamma discrimination from space observations","
Abstract: The origin of the highest energy cosmic rays is still unknown. At present,
the major uncertainties are located at energies above $\sim 10^{19.5}$ eV, the
expected beginning of the GZK suppression. This is mainly due to the low
statistics available, a problem that will be addressed in unprecedented way by
the upcoming orbital detectors like JEM-EUSO. The detection of very high energy
photons is of great relevance for the understanding of the origin of this
extreme energy cosmic rays (EECR), due to the astrophysical information
content. However, their discrimination is an experimental challenge for current
and future cosmic ray detectors. In this work we study the statistical
separation between hadron and photon showers from space observations at
energies where both, the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect and
magnetospheric interactions are important for the development of the cascades.
We base our analysis on the $X_{max}$ parameter, which is already a well known
composition discrimination parameter for ground based fluorescence
observatories. Our analysis applies to orbiting detectors in general.
Nevertheless, we exemplify the practical utilization of our technique by
estimating a general upper limit to the photon fraction in the integral flux,
attainable by an ideal orbital detector with characteristics similar to
JEM-EUSO. In the process we describe the resultant asymmetry in the
photon-hadron discrimination efficiency in galactic coordinates.

Variable turbulent convection as the cause of the Blazhko effect -  testing the Stothers model","
Abstract: The amplitude and phase modulation observed in a significant fraction of the
RR Lyrae variables - the Blazhko effect - represents a long-standing enigma in
stellar pulsation theory. No satisfactory explanation for the Blazhko effect
has been proposed so far. In this paper we focus on the Stothers (2006) idea,
in which modulation is caused by changes in the structure of the outer
convective zone, caused by a quasi-periodically changing magnetic field.
However, up to this date no quantitative estimates were made to investigate
whether such a mechanism can be operational and whether it is capable of
reproducing the light variation we observe in Blazhko variables. We address the
latter problem. We use a simplified model, in which the variation of turbulent
convection is introduced into the non-linear hydrodynamic models in an ad hoc
way, neglecting interaction with the magnetic field. We study the light curve
variation through the modulation cycle and properties of the resulting
frequency spectra. Our results are compared with Kepler observations of RR Lyr.
We find that reproducing the light curve variation, as is observed in RR Lyr,
requires a huge modulation of the mixing length, of the order of +/-50 per
cent, on a relatively short time-scale of less than 40 days. Even then, we are
not able to reproduce neither all the observed relations between modulation
components present in the frequency spectrum, nor the relations between Fourier
parameters describing the shape of the instantaneous light curves.

evidence for the evolution in IR/radio flux ratios suggested by previous
authors. The fall-off in dust temperatures is similar to that determined in
previous studies, whilst levels of Ly heating are < 0.5 of the total energy
budget of the grains. There appears to be an evolution in the infrared excess

"Title:
Observing other universe through ringholes and Klein-bottle holes","
Abstract: It is argued that whereas the Shatskiy single rings produced by the
gravitational inner field of a spherically symmetric wormhole and the
concentric double Einstein rings generated by a toroidal ringhole could not be
used without some uncertainty to identify the presence of such tunnelings in
the universe or the existence of a parallel universe, the image which the inner
gravitational field of a non orientable Klein-bottle hole tunneling would leave
by lensing a single luminous source is that of a truncated double spiral, which
is a signature that cannot be attributed to any other single or composite
astronomical object in whichever universe it may be placed. In this report we
argue some more reasons to predict that such a signature would imply the
discovery of one such non orientable tunneling in our or other universe. After
all, a nonorientable Klein-bottle hole is also a perfectly valid solution to
the Einstein equations and the stuff which would make it feasible is becoming
more and more familiar in cosmology.

Galactic plane and listed in the Lanning (Lan) catalog of such sources. A
subsample of 213 UV bright Lan sources have been identified as candidate white

the stars (Lan 161) having an unresolved M dwarf as a companion. Five more
sources are confirmed to be helium white dwarfs, with subtypes from DB3 to DB6.
One source (Lan 364) is identified as a DZ 3 white dwarf, with strong lines of
calcium. Three more stars are found to have featureless spectra (to within

three sources are found to be hot subdwarfs: Lan 20 and Lan 480 are classified
as sdOB, and Lan 432 is classified sdB. The remaining four objects are found to
be field F star interlopers. Physical parameters of the DA and DB white dwarfs

"Title:
Dust in the early Universe: Evidence for non-stellar dust production or  observational errors?","
Abstract: Observations have revealed unexpectedly large amounts of dust in
high-redshift galaxies and its origin is still much debated. Valiante et al.
(2009, MNRAS, 397, 1661) suggested the net stellar dust production of the
quasar host galaxy SDSS J1148+5251 may be sufficient to explain the large dust
mass detected in this galaxy, albeit under some very special assumptions (e.g.,
'closed box' evolution and a rather high gas mass). Here it is shown that since
accretion of essentially pristine material may lower the efficiency of dust
formation significantly, and the observationally derived dust-to-gas ratios for
these high-redshift galaxies are remarkably high, stellar dust production is
likely insufficient. A model including metallicity-dependent, non-stellar dust
formation ('secondary dust') is presented. The required contribution from this
non-stellar dust component appears too large, however. If all observational
constraints are to be met, the resultant dust-to-metals ratio is close to
unity, which means that almost all interstellar metals exist in the form dust.
This is a very unlikely situation and suggests the large dust-to-gas ratios at
high-redshifts may be due to observational uncertainties and/or or incorrect
calibration of conversion factors for gas and dust tracers.

The first evidence for multiple pulsation axes: a new roAp star in the  Kepler field, KIC 10195926","
Abstract: We have discovered a new rapidly oscillating Ap star among the Kepler Mission
target stars, KIC 10195926. This star shows two pulsation modes with periods
that are amongst the longest known for roAp stars at 17.1 min and 18.1 min,
indicating that the star is near the terminal age main sequence. The principal
pulsation mode is an oblique dipole mode that shows a rotationally split
frequency septuplet that provides information on the geometry of the mode. The
secondary mode also appears to be a dipole mode with a rotationally split
triplet, but we are able to show within the improved oblique pulsator model
that these two modes cannot have the same axis of pulsation. This is the first
time for any pulsating star that evidence has been found for separate pulsation
axes for different modes. The two modes are separated in frequency by 55
microHz, which we model as the large separation. The star is an alpha^2 CVn
spotted magnetic variable that shows a complex rotational light variation with
a period of Prot = 5.68459 d. For the first time for any spotted magnetic star
of the upper main sequence, we find clear evidence of light variation with a
period of twice the rotation period; i.e. a subharmonic frequency of $\nu_{\rm
rot}/2$. We propose that this and other subharmonics are the first observed
manifestation of torsional modes in an roAp star. From high resolution spectra
we determine Teff = 7400 K, log g = 3.6 and v sin i = 21 km/s. We have found a
magnetic pulsation model with fundamental parameters close to these values that
reproduces the rotational variations of the two obliquely pulsating modes with
different pulsation axes. The star shows overabundances of the rare earth
elements, but these are not as extreme as most other roAp stars. The spectrum
is variable with rotation, indicating surface abundance patches.

Impact of the recent results by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations at the  CERN Large Hadron Collider on an effective Minimal Supersymmetric extension  of the Standard Model","
Abstract: We discuss the impact for light neutralinos in an effective Minimal
Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model of the recent results presented
by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations at the CERN Large Hadron Collider for a
search of supersymmetry in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy

specific case of light neutralinos, efficiencies for the specific signature
searched by ATLAS (jets+missing transverse energy and an isolated lepton) imply
a lower sensitivity compared to CMS (which searches for jets +missing
transverse energy). Focusing on the CMS bound, if squark soft masses of the
three families are assumed to be degenerate, the combination of the ensuing
constraint on squark and gluino masses with the experimental limit on the b to
s + gamma decay imply a lower bound on the neutralino mass that can reach the
value of 11.9 GeV, depending on the gluino mass. On the other hand, when the
universality condition among squark soft parameters is relaxed, the lower bound
on the neutralino mass is not constrained by the CMS measurement and then
remains at the value 7.5 GeV derived in previous papers.

Probabilistic Cross-Identification of Cosmic Events","
Abstract: We discuss a novel approach to identifying cosmic events in separate and
independent observations. In our focus are the true events, such as supernova
explosions, that happen once, hence, whose measurements are not repeatable.
Their classification and analysis have to make the best use of all the
available data. Bayesian hypothesis testing is used to associate streams of
events in space and time. Probabilities are assigned to the matches by studying
their rates of occurrence. A case study of Type Ia supernovae illustrates how
to use lightcurves in the cross-identification process. Constraints from
realistic lightcurves happen to be well-approximated by Gaussians in time,
which makes the matching process very efficient. Model-dependent associations
are computationally more demanding but can further boost our confidence.

The Dependence of Brown Dwarf Radii on Atmospheric Metallicity and  Clouds: Theory and Comparison with Observations","
Abstract: Employing realistic and consistent atmosphere boundary conditions, we have
generated evolutionary models for brown dwarfs and very-low-mass stars (VLMs)
for different metallicities ([Fe/H]), with and without clouds. We find that the
spread in radius at a given mass and age can be as large as $\sim$10% to
$\sim$25%, with higher-metallicity, higher-cloud-thickness atmospheres
resulting quite naturally in larger radii. For each 0.1 dex increase in [Fe/H],
radii increase by $\sim$1% to $\sim$2.5%, depending upon age and mass. We also
find that, while for smaller masses and older ages brown dwarf radii decrease
with increasing helium fraction ($Y$) (as expected), for more massive brown
dwarfs and a wide range of ages they increase with helium fraction. The
increase in radius in going from $Y=0.25$ to $Y=0.28$ can be as large as
$\sim$0.025 \rj\ ($\sim$2.5%). Furthermore, we find that for VLMs an increase
in atmospheric metallicity from 0.0 to 0.5 dex, increases radii by $\sim$4%,
and from -0.5 to 0.5 dex by $\sim$10%. Therefore, we suggest that opacity due
to higher metallicity might naturally account for the apparent radius anomalies
in some eclipsing VLM systems. Ten to twenty-five percent variations in radius
exceed errors stemming from uncertainities in the equation of state alone. This
serves to emphasize that transit and eclipse measurements of brown dwarf radii
constrain numerous effects collectively, importantly including the atmosphere
and condensate cloud models, and not just the equation of state. At all times,
one is testing a multi-parameter theory, and not a universal radius$-$mass
relation.

Multifrequency VLBA study of the blazar S5 0716+714 during the active  state in 2004 II. Large-scale jet kinematics and the comparison of the  different methods of VLBI data imaging as applied to kinematic studies of AGN","
Abstract: We study the jet kinematics of the blazar S5 0716+714 during its active state

analysis of the large-scale (0-12 mas) jet of 0716+714, based on the results of
six epochs of VLBA monitoring at 5 GHz. Additionally, we compare kinematic
results obtained with two imaging methods based on different deconvolution
algorithms. The blazar 0716+714 has a diffuse large-scale jet and a very faint
bright compact core. Experiments with simulated data showed that the
conventional data reduction procedure based on the CLEAN deconvolution
algorithm does not perform well in restoring this type of structure. This might
be the reason why previous kinematic studies of this source yielded ambiguous
results. In order to obtain accurate kinematics of this source, we
independently applied two imaging techniques to the raw data: the conventional
method, based on difference mapping, which uses CLEAN deconvolution, and the
generalized maximum entropy method (GMEM) realized in the VLBImager package
developed at the Pulkovo Observatory in Russia. The results of both methods
give us a consistent kinematic scenario: the large-scale jet of 0716+714 is
diffuse and stationary. Differences between the inner (0-1 mas) and outer (1-12
mas) regions of the jet in brightness and velocity of the components could be
explained by the bending of the jet, which causes the angle between the jet
direction and the line of sight to change from ~5 deg to ~11 deg. For the
source 0716+714 both methods worked at the limit of their capability.

Abstract: In astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and electrodynamics simulations,
numerically enforcing the divB=0 constraint on the magnetic field has been

principle clarifies the nature of divB != 0 errors. The principles and
techniques demonstrated in this paper are particularly useful for the magnetic

colour and metallicity distributions, as well as the GC number density profile.
One of our most significant findings is evidence for a flattening in the radial
GC number density profile in the outer halo. Intriguingly, this occurs at a
galactocentric radius of ~2 degrees (~30 kpc) which is the radius at which the
underlying stellar halo surface density has also been shown to flatten. The GCs
which lie beyond this radius are remarkably uniform in terms of their blue
(V-I)o colours, consistent with them belonging to an ancient population with
little to no metallicity gradient. Structural parameters are also derived for a
sample of 13 newly-discovered extended clusters (ECs) and we find the lowest
luminosity ECs have magnitudes and sizes similar to Palomar-type GCs in the

A new method to calibrate ionospheric pulse dispersion for UHE cosmic  ray and neutrino detection using the Lunar Cherenkov technique","
Abstract: UHE particle detection using the lunar Cherenkov technique aims to detect
nanosecond pulses of Cherenkov emission which are produced during UHE cosmic
ray and neutrino interactions in the Moon's regolith. These pulses will reach
Earth-based telescopes dispersed, and therefore reduced in amplitude, due to
their propagation through the Earth's ionosphere. To maximise the received
signal to noise ratio and subsequent chances of pulse detection, ionospheric
dispersion must therefore be corrected, and since the high time resolution
would require excessive data storage this correction must be made in real time.
This requires an accurate knowledge of the dispersion characteristic which is
parameterised by the instantaneous Total Electron Content (TEC) of the
ionosphere. A new method to calibrate the dispersive effect of the ionosphere
on lunar Cherenkov pulses has been developed for the LUNASKA lunar Cherenkov
experiments. This method exploits radial symmetries in the distribution of the
Moon's polarised emission to make Faraday rotation measurements in the
visibility domain of synthesis array data (i. e. instantaneously). Faraday
rotation measurements are then combined with geomagnetic field models to
estimate the ionospheric TEC. This method of ionospheric calibration is
particularly attractive for the lunar Cherenkov technique as it may be used in
real time to estimate the ionospheric TEC along a line-of-sight to the Moon and
using the same radio telescope.

Zonal shear and super-rotation in a magnetized spherical Couette flow  experiment","
Abstract: We present measurements performed in a spherical shell filled with liquid
sodium, where a 74 mm-radius inner sphere is rotated while a 210 mm-radius
outer sphere is at rest. The inner sphere holds a dipolar magnetic field and
acts as a magnetic propeller when rotated. In this experimental set-up called
DTS, direct measurements of the velocity are performed by ultrasonic Doppler
velocimetry. Differences in electric potential and the induced magnetic field
are also measured to characterize the magnetohydrodynamic flow. Rotation
frequencies of the inner sphere are varied between -30 Hz and +30 Hz, the
magnetic Reynolds number based on measured sodium velocities and on the shell
radius reaching to about 33. We have investigated the mean axisymmetric part of
the flow, which consists of differential rotation. Strong super-rotation of the
fluid with respect to the rotating inner sphere is directly measured. It is
found that the organization of the mean flow does not change much throughout
the entire range of parameters covered by our experiment. The direct
measurements of zonal velocity give a nice illustration of Ferraro's law of
isorotation in the vicinity of the inner sphere where magnetic forces dominate
inertial ones. The transition from a Ferraro regime in the interior to a
geostrophic regime, where inertial forces predominate, in the outer regions has
been well documented. It takes place where the local Elsasser number is about
1. A quantitative agreement with non-linear numerical simulations is obtained
when keeping the same Elsasser number. The experiments also reveal a region
that violates Ferraro's law just above the inner sphere.

Solar cycle variations of large frequency separations of acoustic modes:  Implications for asteroseismology","
Abstract: We have studied solar cycle changes in the large frequency separations that
can be observed in Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) data. The
large frequency separation is often one of the first outputs from asteroseismic
studies because it can help constrain stellar properties like mass and radius.
We have used three methods for estimating the large separations: use of
individual p-mode frequencies, computation of the autocorrelation of
frequency-power spectra, and computation of the power spectrum of the power
spectrum. The values of the large separations obtained by the different methods
are offset from each other and have differing sensitivities to the realization
noise. A simple model was used to predict solar cycle variations in the large
separations, indicating that the variations are due to the well-known solar
cycle changes to mode frequency. However, this model is only valid over a
restricted frequency range. We discuss the implications of these results for

Order statistics of the early-type galaxy luminosity function","
Abstract: We apply order statistics (OS) to the bright end ($M_r < -22$) of the

in what limit the $k^{th}$ most luminous galaxies can be used as standard

Since our sample contains all bright galaxies including the brightest cluster
galaxies (BCG), based on OS we argue that BCGs can be considered as statistical
extremes of a well-established Schechter luminosity distribution when galaxies
are binned by redshift and not cluster-by-cluster. We presume that the reason
behind this might be that luminous red ellipticals in galaxy clusters are \em
not random \em samples of an overall luminosity distribution but biased by the
fact that they are in a cluster containing the BCG. We show that a simple
statistical toy model can reproduce the well-known magnitude gap between the
BCG and the second brightest galaxy of the clusters.

Radial distribution of stars, gas and dust in SINGS galaxies. III.  Modeling the evolution of the stellar component in galaxy disks","
Abstract: (Abridged) We analyze the evolution of 42 spiral galaxies in the Spitzer

near-infrared radial profiles to probe the emission of stars of different ages
as a function of radius. We fit these profiles with models that describe the
chemical and spectro-photometric evolution of spiral disks within a
self-consistent framework. These backward models succesfully reproduce the
multi-wavelength profiles of our galaxies, except the UV profiles of some
early-type disks. From the model fitting we infer the maximum circular velocity
of the rotation curve (Vc) and the dimensionless spin parameter (lambda). The
values of Vc are in good agreement with the velocities measured in HI rotation
curves. While our sample is not volume-limited, the resulting distribution of
spins is close to the lognormal function obtained in cosmological N-body
simulations, peaking at ~0.03 regardless of the total halo mass. We do not find
any evident trend between spin and Hubble type, besides an increase in the
scatter for the latest types. According to the model, galaxies evolve along a
roughly constant mass-size relation, increasing their scale-lengths as they
become more massive. The radial scale-length of most disks in our sample seems
to have increased at a rate of 0.05-0.06 kpc/Gyr, being now 20-25% larger than

non-gravitational effects for eleven of these 15 comets have been determined
for the first time. These were propagated numerically back and forth up to the
250 au heliocentric distance, constituting sets of original and future orbits
together with their uncertainties. Next we followed the dynamical evolution
under the Galactic tides for one orbital revolution to the past and future,
obtaining orbital elements at previous/next perihelion passages. We obtained a
clear dependence of the last revolution change in perihelion distance with
respect to the 1/aori, what confirmed theoretical expectations. We show that
about 50 per cent of all investigated comets have their previous perihelion
distance below the 15 au limit. This resulted in classifying 31 comets as
dynamically new, 26 as dynamically old and 7 having unclear status. We also
present several examples of cometary motion through the Jupiter-Saturn barrier,
some of them with the previous perihelion distance smaller than the observed

sources in the Milky Way are used to map the spiral structure of our Galaxy and
to determine fundamental parameters such as the rotation velocity ($\Theta_0$)
and curve and the distance to the Galactic center (R$_0$). Here, we present an
update on our first results, implementing a recent change in the knowledge
about the Solar motion. It seems unavoidable that the IAU recommended values
for R$_0$ and $\Theta_0$ need a substantial revision. In particular the
combination of 8.5 kpc and 220 \kms\, can be ruled out with high confidence.
Combining the maser data with the distance to the Galactic center from stellar
orbits and the proper motion of Sgr\,A* gives best values of R$_0$ = 8.3 $\pm$
0.23 kpc and $\Theta_0$ = 239 or 246 $\pm$ 7 \kms, for Solar motions of V$_
\odot$ = 12.23 and 5.25 \kms, respectively. Finally, we give an outlook to
future observations in the Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy (BeSSeL) Survey.

"Title:
An empirical calibration of Lick indices using Milky Way Globular  Clusters","
Abstract: To provide an empirical calibration relation in order to convert Lick indices
into abundances for the integrated light of old, simple stellar populations for
a large range in the observed [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]. This calibration
supersedes the previously adopted ones because it is be based on the real
abundance pattern of the stars instead of the commonly adopted metallicity
scale derived from the colours. We carried out a long-slit spectroscopic study
of 23 Galactic globular cluster for which detailed chemical abundances in stars
have been recently measured. The line-strength indices, as coded by the Lick
system and by Serven et al. (2005), were measured in low-resolution integrated
spectra of the GC light. The results were compared to average abundances and
abundance ratios in stars taken from the compilation by Pritzl et al. (2005) as
well as to synthetic models. Fe-related indices grow linearly as a function of
[Fe/H] for [Fe/H]>-2. Mg-related indices respond in a similar way to [Mg/H]
variations, however Mgb turns out to be a less reliable metallicity indicator
for [Z/H]<-1.5 . Despite the known Mg overabundance with respect to Fe in GC
stars, it proved impossible to infer a mean [Mg/Fe] for integrated spectra that
correlates with the resolved stars properties, because the sensitivity of the
indices to [Mg/Fe] is smaller at lower metallicities. We present empirical
calibrations for Ca, TiO, Ba and Eu indices as well as the measurements of
H_alpha and NaD.

"Title:
Networks of gravitational wave detectors and three figures of merit","
Abstract: This paper develops a general framework for studying the effectiveness of
networks of interferometric gravitational wave detectors and then uses it to
show that enlarging the existing LIGO-VIRGO network with one or more planned or
proposed detectors in Japan (LCGT), Australia, and India brings major benefits,
including much larger detection rate increases than previously thought... I
show that there is a universal probability distribution function (pdf) for
detected SNR values, which implies that the most likely SNR value of the first
detected event will be 1.26 times the search threshold. For binary systems, I
also derive the universal pdf for detected values of the orbital inclination,
taking into account the Malmquist bias; this implies that the number of
gamma-ray bursts associated with detected binary coalescences should be 3.4
times larger than expected from just the beaming fraction of the gamma burst.
Using network antenna patterns, I propose three figures of merit that
characterize the relative performance of different networks... Adding {\em any}
new site to the planned LIGO-VIRGO network can dramatically increase, by
factors of 2 to 4, the detected event rate by allowing coherent data analysis
to reduce the spurious instrumental coincident background. Moving one of the
LIGO detectors to Australia additionally improves direction-finding by a factor
of 4 or more. Adding LCGT to the original LIGO-VIRGO network not only improves
direction-finding but will further increase the detection rate over the
extra-site gain by factors of almost 2, partly by improving the network duty
cycle... Enlarged advanced networks could look forward to detecting three to
four hundred neutron star binary coalescences per year.

The elusive radio loud Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 2110","
Abstract: The AGN NGC 2110 presents a peculiar case among the Seyfert 2 galaxies, as it
displays also features of radio-loud objects and is classified as FR-I radio
galaxy. Here we analyse simultaneous INTEGRAL and Swift data taken in 2008 and
2009. We reconstruct the spectral energy distribution in order to provide
further insight. The combined X-ray spectrum is well represented by an absorbed
cut-off power law model plus soft excess. Combining all available data, the
spectrum appears flat (photon index 1.25 +- 0.04) with the high-energy cut-off
being at 82 +- 9 keV. The intrinsic absorption is moderate (NH = 4E22 1/cm**2),
the iron K-alpha line is weak (EW = 114 eV), and no reflection component is
detected in the INTEGRAL spectrum. The data indicate that the X-ray spectrum is
moderately variable both in flux and spectral shape. The 2008 spectrum is
slightly steeper (photon index 1.5, Ec = 90 keV) with the source being
brighter, and flatter in 2009 (photon index 1.4, Ec = 120 keV) in the lower
flux state. The spectral energy distribution gives a bolometric luminosity of L
= 2E44 erg/sec. NGC 2110 appears to be a borderline object between radio loud
narrow line Seyfert 1 and radio quiet Seyfert 2. Its spectral energy
distribution might indeed be dominated by non-thermal emission arising from the
jet.

The Effect of Environment on the Formation of Halpha Filaments and Cool  Cores in Galaxy Groups and Clusters","
Abstract: We present the results of a combined X-ray and Halpha study of 10 galaxy
groups and 17 galaxy clusters using the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the
Maryland Magellan Tunable Filter. We find no difference in the morphology or
detection frequency of Halpha filaments in groups versus clusters, over the
mass range 10^13 < M_500 < 10^15 Msun. The detection frequency of Halpha
emission is shown to be only weakly dependent on the total mass of the system,
at the 52% confidence level. In contrast, we find that the presence of Halpha
filaments is strongly correlated with both the global (89% confidence level)
and core (84%) ICM entropy, as well as the X-ray cooling rate (72%). The Halpha
filaments are therefore an excellent proxy for the cooling ICM. The Halpha
filaments are more strongly correlated with the cooling properties of the ICM
than with the radio properties of the BCG; this further supports the scenario
where these filaments are directly associated with a thermally-unstable,
rapidly cooling ICM, rather than radio bubbles. The ICM cooling efficiency,
defined as the X-ray cooling rate per unit gas mass, is shown to correlate with
the total system mass, indicating that groups are more efficient at cooling
than clusters. This result implies that, in systems with cool cores, AGN
feedback scales with the total mass of the system, in agreement with earlier
suggestions.

Abstract: We review our current understanding of how the first galaxies formed at the

large telescopes discovered galaxies at redshifts greater than seven, whereas
theoretical studies have just reached the degree of sophistication necessary to

Remote Sensing D/H Ratios in Methane Ice: Temperature-Dependent  Absorption Coefficients of CH3D in Methane Ice and in Nitrogen Ice","
Abstract: The existence of strong absorption bands of singly deuterated methane (CH3D)
at wavelengths where normal methane (CH4) absorbs comparatively weakly could
enable remote measurement of D/H ratios in methane ice on outer solar system

report temperature-dependent absorption coefficients of these bands when the
CH3D is diluted in CH4 ice and also when it is dissolved in N2 ice, and
describe how these absorption coefficients can be combined with data from the
literature to simulate arbitrary D/H ratio absorption coefficients for CH4 ice
and for CH4 in N2 ice. We anticipate these results motivating new telescopic
observations to measure D/H ratios in CH4 ice on Triton, Pluto, Eris, and

Metal accretion onto white dwarfs caused by Poynting-Robertson drag on  their debris disks","
Abstract: Recent discoveries of compact (sizes $<R_\odot$) debris disks around more
than a dozen of metal-rich white dwarfs (WDs) suggest that pollution of these
stars with metals may be caused by accretion of high-Z material from the disk.
But the mechanism responsible for efficient transfer of mass from a particulate
disk to the WD atmosphere has not yet been identified. Here we demonstrate that
radiation of the WD can effectively drive accretion of matter through the disk
towards the sublimation radius (located at several tens of WD radii), where
particles evaporate, feeding a disk of metal gas accreting onto the WD. We show
that, contrary to some previous claims, Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag on the
debris disk is effective at providing metal accretion rate $\dot M_{PR}\sim
10^8$ g/s and higher, scaling quadratically with WD effective temperature. We
compare our results with observations and show that, as expected, no WD hosting
a particulate debris disk shows evidence of metal accretion rate below that
produced by the PR drag. Existence of WDs accreting metals at rates
significantly higher than $\dot M_{PR}$ suggests that another mechanism in
addition to PR drag drives accretion of high-Z elements in these systems.

Cosmic Ray Spectrum in Supernova Remnant Shocks","
Abstract: We performed kinetic simulations of diffusive shock acceleration in Type Ia

The preshock gas temperature is the primary parameter that governs the cosmic
ray (CR) acceleration, while magnetic field strength and CR injection rate are
secondary parameters. SNRs in the hot ISM, with an injection fraction smaller
than 10^{-4}, are inefficient accelerators with less than 10 % energy getting
converted to CRs. The shock structure is almost test-particle like and the
ensuing CR spectrum can be steeper than E^{-2}. Although the particles can be
accelerated to the knee energy of 10^{15.5}Z eV with amplified magnetic fields
in the precursor, Alfv'enic drift of scattering centers softens the source
spectrum as steep as E^{-2.1} and reduces the CR acceleration efficiency.

Black Hole Masses and Star Formation Rates of z >1 Dust Obscured  Galaxies (DOGs): Results from Keck OSIRIS Integral Field Spectroscopy","
Abstract: We have obtained high spatial resolution Keck OSIRIS integral field
spectroscopy of four z~1.5 ultra-luminous infrared galaxies that exhibit broad
H-alpha emission lines indicative of strong AGN activity. The observations were
made with the Keck laser guide star adaptive optics system giving a spatial
resolution of 0.1"", or <1 kpc at these redshifts. These high spatial resolution
observations help to spatially separate the extended narrow-line regions ---
possibly powered by star formation --- from the nuclear regions, which may be
powered by both star formation and AGN activity. There is no evidence for
extended, rotating gas disks in these four galaxies. Assuming dust correction
factors as high as A(H-alpha)=4.8 mag, the observations suggest lower limits on
the black hole masses of (1 - 9) x 10^8 solar masses, and star formation rates
<100 solar masses per year. The black hole masses and star formation rates of
the sample galaxies appear low in comparison to other high-z galaxies with
similar host luminosities. We explore possible explanations for these
observations including, host galaxy fading, black hole growth, and the shut
down of star formation.

"Title:
Star formation efficiency as a function of metallicity: from star  clusters to galaxies","
Abstract: We explore how the star formation efficiency in a protocluster clump is
regulated by metallicity dependent stellar winds from the newly formed massive
OB stars (Mstar >5 Msol). The model describes the co-evolution of the mass
function of gravitationally bound cores and of the IMF in a protocluster clump.
Dense cores are generated uniformly in time at different locations in the
clump, and contract over lifetimes that are a few times their free fall times.
The cores collapse to form stars that power strong stellar winds whose
cumulative kinetic energy evacuates the gas from the clump and quenches further
core and star formation. This sets the final star formation efficiency, SFEf.
Models are run with various metallicities in the range Z/Zsol=[0.1,2]. We find
that the SFEf decreases strongly with increasing metallicity.The
SFEf-metallicity relation is well described by a decaying exponential whose
exact parameters depend weakly on the value of the core formation efficiency.
We find that there is almost no dependence of the SFEf-metallicity relation on
the clump mass. This is due to the fact that an increase (decrease) in the
clump mass leads to an increase (decrease) in the feedback from OB stars which
is opposed by an increase (decrease) in the gravitational potential of the
clump. The clump mass-cluster mass relations we find for all of the different
metallicity cases imply a negligible difference between the exponent of the
mass function of the protocluster clumps and that of the young clusters mass
function. By normalizing the SFEs to their value for the solar metallicity
case, we compare our results to SFE-metallicity relations derived on galactic
scales and find a good agreement. As a by-product of this study, we also
provide ready-to-use prescriptions for the power of stellar winds of main
sequence OB stars in the mass range [5,80] Msol in the metallicity range we
have considered

X-ray Spectroscopy of the Virgo Cluster out to the Virial Radius","
Abstract: We present results from the analysis of a mosaic of thirteen XMM-Newton
pointings covering the Virgo Cluster from its center northwards out to a radius
r~1.2 Mpc (~4.5 degrees), reaching the virial radius and beyond. This is the
first time that the properties of a modestly sized (M_vir~1.4e14 M_sun, kT~2.3
keV), dynamically young cluster have been studied out to the virial radius. The
density profile of the cluster can be described by a surprisingly shallow
power-law with index 1.21+/-0.12. In the radial range of 0.3r_vir<r<r_vir, the
best fit temperature drops by roughly 60 per cent. Within a radius r<450 kpc,
the entropy profile has an approximate power-law form with index 1.1, as
expected for gravitationally collapsed gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. Beyond
r~450 kpc, however, the temperature and metallicity drop abruptly, and the
entropy profile becomes flatter, staying consistently below the expected value
by a factor of 2-2.5. The most likely explanation for the unusually shallow
density profile and the flattening of entropy at large radius is clumping in
the ICM. Our data provide direct observational evidence that the ICM is
enriched by metals all the way to r_200 to at least Z=0.1 Solar.

Simulating Flaring Events in Complex Active Regions Driven by Observed  Magnetograms","
Abstract: We interpret solar flares as events originating from active regions that have
reached the Self Organized Critical state, by using a refined Cellular
Automaton model with initial conditions derived from observations. Aims: We
investigate whether the system, with its imposed physical elements,reaches a
Self Organized Critical state and whether well-known statistical properties of
flares, such as scaling laws observed in the distribution functions of
characteristic parameters, are reproduced after this state has been reached.
Results: Our results show that Self Organized Criticality is indeed reached
when applying specific loading and relaxation rules. Power law indices obtained
from the distribution functions of the modeled flaring events are in good
agreement with observations. Single power laws (peak and total flare energy) as
well as power laws with exponential cutoff and double power laws (flare
duration) are obtained. The results are also compared with observational X-ray
data from GOES satellite for our active-region sample. Conclusions: We conclude
that well-known statistical properties of flares are reproduced after the
system has reached Self Organized Criticality. A significant enhancement of our
refined Cellular Automaton model is that it commences the simulation from
observed vector magnetograms, thus facilitating energy calculation in physical
units. The model described in this study remains consistent with fundamental
physical requirements, and imposes physically meaningful driving and
redistribution rules.

Abstract: Compact steep-spectrum radio sources and giga-hertz peaked spectrum radio
sources (CSS/GPS) are generally considered to be mostly young radio sources. In
recent years we studied at many wavelengths a sample of these objects selected
from the B3-VLA catalog: the B3-VLA CSS sample. Only ~ 60 % of the sources were
optically identified. We aim to increase the number of optical identifications
and study the properties of the host galaxies of young radio sources. We
cross-correlated the CSS B3-VLA sample with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS), DR7, and complemented the SDSS photometry with available GALEX (DR 4/5
and 6) and near-IR data from UKIRT and 2MASS. We obtained new identifications
and photometric redshifts for eight faint galaxies and for one quasar and two
quasar candidates. Overall we have 27 galaxies with SDSS photometry in five
bands, for which we derived the ultraviolet-optical spectral energy
distribution (UV-O-SED). We extended our investigation to additional CSS/GPS
selected from the literature. Most of the galaxies show an excess of
ultra-violet (UV) radiation compared with the UV-O-SED of local radio-quiet
ellipticals. We found a strong dependence of the UV excess on redshift and
analyzed it assuming that it is generated either from the nucleus (hidden
quasar) or from a young stellar population (YSP). We also compare the UV-O-SEDs
of our CSS/GPS sources with those of a selection of large size (LSO) powerful
radio sources from the literature. If the major process of the UV excess is
caused by a YSP, our conclusion is that it is the result of the merger process
that also triggered the onset of the radio source with some time delay. We do
not see evidence for a major contribution from a YSP triggered by the radio
sources itself.

On interpretation of recent proper motion data for the Large Magellanic  Cloud","
Abstract: Recent observational studies using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have
derived the center-of-mass proper motion (CMPM) of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC). Although these studies carefully treated both rotation and perspective
effects in deriving the proper motion for each of the sampled fields, they did
not consider the effects of local random motion in the derivation. This means
that the average PM of the fields (i.e., the observed CMPM) could significantly
deviate from the true CMPM, because the effect of local random motion can not
be close to zero in making the average PM for the small number of the fields
(~10). We discuss how significantly the observationally derived CMPM can
deviate from the true CMPM by applying the same method as used in the
observations for a dynamical model of the LMC with a known true CMPM. We find
that the deviation can be as large as ~ 50 km/s (~0.21 mas/yr), if the LMC has
a thick disk and a maximum circular velocity of ~120$ km/s. We also find that
the deviation depends both on the total number of the sampled fields and on
structure and kinematics of the LMC. We therefore suggest that there is a
possibility that the observed CMPM of the LMC deviates from the true one to
some extent. We also show that a simple mean of PM for a large number of the
LMC fields (~1000) can be much closer to the true CMPM.

U and Th content in the Central Apennines continental crust: a  contribution to the determination of the geo-neutrinos flux at LNGS","
Abstract: The regional contribution to the geo-neutrino signal at Gran Sasso National
Laboratory (LNGS) was determined based on a detailed geological, geochemical
and geophysical study of the region. U and Th abundances of more than 50
samples representative of the main lithotypes belonging to the Mesozoic and
Cenozoic sedimentary cover were analyzed. Sedimentary rocks were grouped into
four main ""Reservoirs"" based on similar paleogeographic conditions and
mineralogy. Basement rocks do not outcrop in the area. Thus U and Th in the
Upper and Lower Crust of Valsugana and Ivrea-Verbano areas were analyzed. Based
on geological and geophysical properties, relative abundances of the various
reservoirs were calculated and used to obtain the weighted U and Th abundances
for each of the three geological layers (Sedimentary Cover, Upper and Lower
Crust). Using the available seismic profile as well as the stratigraphic
records from a number of exploration wells, a 3D modelling was developed over
an area of 2^{\circ}x2^{\circ} down to the Moho depth, for a total volume of
about 1.2x10^6 km^3. This model allowed us to determine the volume of the
various geological layers and eventually integrate the Th and U contents of the
whole crust beneath LNGS. On this base the local contribution to the
geo-neutrino flux (S) was calculated and added to the contribution given by the
rest of the world, yielding a Refined Reference Model prediction for the
geo-neutrino signal in the Borexino detector at LNGS: S(U) = (28.7 \pm 3.9) TNU

previously obtained by Mantovani et al. (2004) who calculated, based on general
worldwide assumptions, a signal of 40.5 TNU. The considerable thickness of the
sedimentary rocks, almost predominantly represented by U- and Th- poor
carbonatic rocks in the area near LNGS, is responsible for this difference.

"Title:
Magnetorotational turbulence transports angular momentum in stratified  disks with low magnetic Prandtl number but magnetic Reynolds number above a  critical value","
Abstract: The magnetorotational instability (MRI) may dominate outward transport of
angular momentum in accretion disks, allowing material to fall onto the central
object. Previous work has established that the MRI can drive a mean-field
dynamo, possibly leading to a self-sustaining accretion system. Recently,
however, simulations of the scaling of the angular momentum transport parameter
$\alphaSS$ with the magnetic Prandtl number $\Prandtl$ have cast doubt on the
ability of the MRI to transport astrophysically relevant amounts of angular
momentum in real disk systems. Here, we use simulations including explicit
physical viscosity and resistivity to show that when vertical stratification is
included, mean field dynamo action operates, driving the system to a
configuration in which the magnetic field is not fully helical. This relaxes
the constraints on the generated field provided by magnetic helicity
conservation, allowing the generation of a mean field on timescales independent
of the resistivity. Our models demonstrate the existence of a critical magnetic
Reynolds number $\Rmagc$, below which transport becomes strongly
$\Prandtl$-dependent and chaotic, but above which the transport is steady and
$\Prandtl$-independent. Prior simulations showing $\Prandtl$-dependence had
$\Rmag < \Rmagc$. We conjecture that this steady regime is possible because the
mean field dynamo is not helicity-limited and thus does not depend on the
details of the helicity ejection process. Scaling to realistic astrophysical
parameters suggests that disks around both protostars and stellar mass black
holes have $\Rmag >> \Rmagc$. Thus, we suggest that the strong $\Prandtl$
dependence seen in recent simulations does not occur in real systems.

"Title:
The drop in the cosmic star formation rate below redshift 2 is caused by  a change in the mode of gas accretion and by AGN feedback","
Abstract: The cosmic star formation rate is observed to drop sharply after redshift
z=2. We use a large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation
to investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretion
and to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the drop
in the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global
cold-mode accretion rate density onto haloes, but with a delay of order the gas
consumption time scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode
(hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature has never
exceeded (did exceed) 10^5.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks
at z~3, the hot mode continues to increase to z~1 and remains roughly constant
thereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global
accretion rate onto haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo
accretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes onto galaxies. AGN
feedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing gas that entered
haloes in the hot mode from accreting onto their central galaxies.
Consequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode
would become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop off in
the cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep.

Non-LTE calculations for neutral Na in late-type stars using improved  atomic data","
Abstract: Neutral sodium is a minority species in the atmospheres of late-type stars,
and line formation in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is often a poor
assumption, in particular for strong lines. We present an extensive grid of
non-LTE calculations for several NaI lines in cool stellar atmospheres,
including metal-rich and metal-poor dwarfs and giants. For the first time, we
constructed a Na model atom that incorporates accurate quantum mechanical
calculations for collisional excitation and ionisation by electrons as well as
collisional excitation and charge exchange reactions with neutral hydrogen.
Similar to LiI, the new rates for hydrogen impact excitation do not affect the
statistical equilibrium calculations, while charge exchange reactions have a
small but non-negligible influence. The presented LTE and non-LTE
curves-of-growth can be interpolated to obtain non-LTE abundances and abundance
corrections for arbitrary stellar parameter combinations and line strengths.
The typical corrections for weak lines are -0.1...-0.2dex, whereas saturated
lines may overestimate the abundance in LTE by more than 0.5dex. The non-LTE Na

A New Insight into the Classification of Type Ia Supernovae","
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) spectra are compared regarding the coefficient of
the largest wavelet scale in their decomposition. Two distinct subgroups were
identified and their occurrence is discussed in light of use of SNe Ia as
cosmological probes. Apart from the group of normal SNe, another trend
characterised by intrinsically redder colours is consisted of many different SN
events that exhibit diverse properties, including the interaction with the
circumstellar material, the existence of specific shell-structure in or
surrounding the SN ejecta or super-Chandrasekhar mass progenitors. Compared
with the normal objects, these SNe may violate the standard width-luminosity
correction, which could influence the cosmological results if they were all
calibrated equally, since their fraction among SNe Ia is not negligible when
performing precision cosmology. Using largest wavelet scale coefficient in
combination with long-baseline B-I colours, we show how to disentangle SN
intrinsic colour from the part that corresponds to the reddening due to dust
extinction in the host galaxy in the SALT2 colour parameter c, discussing how
the intrinsic colour differences may explain the different reddening laws for
two subsamples. There are wavelength intervals for which the measured largest
scale coefficient is invariant to the additional extinction applied to a
spectrum. Combination of wavelet coefficients measured in different wavelength
intervals can be used to develop a technique that allows for estimation of
extinction.

A Deep Chandra ACIS Study of NGC 4151. I. the X-ray Morphology of the 3  kpc-diameter Circum-nuclear Region and Relation to the Cold Interstellar  Medium","
Abstract: We report on the imaging analysis of 200 ks sub-arcsecond resolution Chandra
ACIS-S observations of the nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151. Bright, structured
soft X-ray emission is observed to extend from 30 pc to 1.3 kpc in the
south-west from the nucleus, much farther than seen in earlier X-ray studies.
The terminus of the north-eastern X-ray emission is spatially coincident with a
CO gas lane, where the outflow likely encounters dense gas in the host galactic
disk. X-ray emission is also detected outside the boundaries of the ionization
cone, which indicates that the gas there is not completely shielded from the
nuclear continuum, as would be the case for a molecular torus collimating the
bicone. In the central r<200 pc region, the subpixel processing of the ACIS
data recovers the morphological details on scales of <30~pc (<0.5"") first
discovered in Chandra HRC images. The X-ray emission is more absorbed towards
the boundaries of the ionization cone, as well as perpendicular to the bicone
along the direction of a putative torus in NGC 4151. The innermost region where
X-ray emission shows the highest hardness ratio, is spatially coincident with
the near-infrared resolved H_2 emission and dusty spirals we find in an HST V-H
color image. The agreement between the observed H_2 line flux and the value
predicted from X-ray-irradiated molecular cloud models supports
photo-excitation by X-rays from the active nucleus as the origin of the H_2
line, although contribution from UV fluorescence or collisional excitation
cannot be fully ruled out with current data. The discrepancy between the mass
of cold molecular gas inferred from recent CO and near-infrared H_2
observations may be explained by the anomalous CO abundance in this X-ray
dominated region. The total H_2 mass derived from the X-ray observation agrees
with measurement in Storchi-Bergmann et al.

V474 Car: A Rare Halo RS CVn Binary in Retrograde Galactic Orbit","
Abstract: We report the discovery that the star V474 Car is an extremely active, high
velocity halo RS CVn system. The star was originally identified as a possible
pre-main sequence star in Carina, given its enhanced stellar activity, rapid
rotation (10.3 days), enhanced Li, and absolute magnitude that places it above
the main sequence. However, its extreme radial velocity (264 km s$^{-1}$)
suggested that this system was unlike any previously known pre-MS system. Our
detailed spectroscopic analysis of echelle spectra taken with the CTIO 4-m
finds that V474 Car is both a spectroscopic binary with orbital period similar
to the photometric rotation period, and metal poor ([Fe/H] $\simeq -$0.99). The
star's Galactic orbit is extremely eccentric (e $\simeq$ 0.93) with
perigalacticon of only $\sim$0.3 kpc of the Galactic center - and its
eccentricity and smallness of its perigalacticon are only surpassed by
$\sim$0.05%, of local F/G-type field stars. The observed characteristics are
consistent with V474 Car being a high velocity, metal poor, tidally-locked
chromospherically active binary (CAB), i.e.\ a halo RS CVn binary, and one of
only a few such specimens known.

"Title:
On the Formation of Penumbrae as Observed with the German VTT, SOHO/MDI,  and SDO/HMI","
Abstract: Solar magnetic fields are generated in the solar interior and pop up at the
solar surface to form active regions. As the magnetic field appears on the
surface, it forms various structures like small magnetic elements, pores, and
sunspots. The nature of these formation processes is largely unknown. In this
contribution we elaborate on the formation of sunspots and particularly on the
formation of penumbrae. We report on observations that we obtained at the
German VTT on July 4, 2009 on the formation of the spot in AR 11024. This data
set is accomplished with data from SOHO/MDI which offers an entire time
coverage. Moreover, the evolution of AR 11024 is compared with a particular
event of penumbra formation in AR 11124 around November 13, 2010, using
intensity images from SDO/HMI. We conclude that two processes contribute to the
increase of the magnetic flux of a sunspot: (1) merging pores, and (2) emerging
bipoles of which the spot polarity migrates towards and merges with the spot.
As the penumbra forms the area, magnetic flux, and maximum field strength in
the umbra stay constant or increase slightly, i.e. the formation of the
penumbra is associated with flux emergence and an flux increase of the
proto-spot. If two pores merge or if a pore merges with a proto-spot a light
bridge is created. This initial light bridge dissolves in the further
evolution.

The effect of the regular solution model in the condensation of  protoplanetary dust","
Abstract: We utilize a chemical equilibrium code in order to study the condensation
process which occurs in protoplanetary discs during the formation of the first
solids. The model specifically focuses on the thermodynamic behaviour on the
solid species assuming the regular solution model. For each solution, we
establish the relationship between the activity of the species, the composition
and the temperature using experimental data from the literature. We then apply
the Gibbs free energy minimization method and study the resulting condensation
sequence for a range of temperatures and pressures within a protoplanetary
disc. Our results using the regular solution model show that grains condense
over a large temperature range and therefore throughout a large portion of the
disc. In the high temperature region (T > 1400 K) Ca-Al compounds dominate and
the formation of corundum is sensitive to the pressure. The mid-temperature
region is dominated by Fe(s) and silicates such as Mg2SiO4 and MgSiO3 . The
chemistry of forsterite and enstatite are strictly related, and our simulations
show a sequence of forsterite-enstatite-forsterite with decreasing temperature.
In the low temperature regions (T < 600 K) a range of iron compounds and
sulfides form. We also run simulations using the ideal solution model and see
clear differences in the resulting condensation sequences with changing
solution model In particular, we find that the turning point in which
forsterite replaces enstatite in the low temperature region is sensitive to the
solution model. Our results show that the ideal solution model is often a poor
approximation to experimental data at most temperatures important in
protoplanetary discs. We find some important differences in the resulting
condensation sequences when using the regular solution model, and suggest that
this model should provide a more realistic condensation sequence.

Kepler Input Catalog: Photometric Calibration and Stellar Classification","
Abstract: We describe the photometric calibration and stellar classification methods
used to produce the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC is a catalog containing
photometric and physical data for sources in the Kepler Mission field of view;
it is used by the mission to select optimal targets. We derived atmospheric
extinction corrections from hourly observations of secondary standard fields
within the Kepler field of view. Repeatability of absolute photometry for stars
brighter than magnitude 15 is typically 2%. We estimated stellar parameters
Teff, log(g), log (Z), E_{B-V} using Bayesian posterior probability
maximization to match observed colors to Castelli stellar atmosphere models. We
applied Bayesian priors describing the distribution of solar-neighborhood stars
in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), in log (Z)$, and in height above the
galactic plane. Comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means
indicate that in most regions of the CMD, our classifications are reliable
within about +/- 200 K and +/- 0.4 dex in log (g). It is difficult to assess
the reliability of our log(Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it
is poor, particularly at extreme Teff. Of great importance for the Kepler
Mission, for Teff <= 5400 K, the distinction between main-sequence stars and
giants has proved to be reliable with better than 98% confidence. The KIC is

Comparison of the metallicity residuals, for two sets of data, based on the

Downward auroral currents from the reconnection Hall-region","
Abstract: We present a simple (stationary) mechanism capable of generating the auroral
downward field-aligned electric field {that is} needed for {accelerating the
ionospheric electron component up into the magnetosphere and confining the
ionospheric ions at low latitudes (as is required by observation of an
ionospheric cavity in the downward auroral current region). The lifted
ionospheric electrons carry the downward auroral current. Our model is based on
the assumption of collisionless reconnection in the tail current sheet. It
makes use of the dynamical difference between electrons and ions in the ion
inertial region surrounding the reconnection {\sf X}-line which causes Hall
currents to flow. We show that the spatial confinement of the Hall magnetic
field and flux to the ion inertial region centred on the {\sf X}-point
generates a spatially variable electromotive force which is positive near the
outer inflow boundaries of the ion inertial region and negative in the central
inflow region. Looked {at} from the ionosphere it functions like a localised
meso-scale electric potential.} The positive electromotive force gives rise to
upward electron flow from the ionosphere {during substorms (causing `black
aurorae')}. A similar positive potential is identified on the earthward side of
the fast reconnection outflow region which has the same effect, explaining the
observation that auroral upward currents are flanked from both sides by narrow
downward currents. keywords{Field-aligned auroral currents, parallel fields,

Abstract: Radio continuum, Spitzer infrared, optical and XMM-Newton X-ray and UVM2

and the galactic nuclei in the interacting galaxies NGC 2207/IC 2163. There are
two types of large-scale shock fronts in this galaxy pair. The shock front
along the rim of the ocular oval in IC 2163 has produced vigorous star
formation in a dusty environment. In the outer part of the companion side of
NGC 2207, a large-scale front attributed to disk or halo scraping is
particularly bright in the radio continuum but not in any tracers of recent
star formation or in X-rays. This radio continuum front may be mainly in the
halo on the back side of NGC 2207 between the two galaxies. Values of the flux
density ratio S(8 um)/S(6 cm) of kpc-sized, Spitzer IRAC star-forming clumps in

evidence that in 2001 a radio supernova was present in the core of feature i, a
mini-starburst on an outer arm of NGC 2207. X-ray emission is detected from the
NGC 2207 nucleus and from nine discrete sources, one of which corresponds to SN

changes from O9.5 to B1 in the case of MM1. This spectral type is still
consistent with that of the massive star. The radial velocity derived from the

Potential Biosignatures in Super-Earth Atmospheres","
Abstract: Atmospheric temperature and mixing ratio profiles of terrestrial planets vary
with the spectral energy flux distribution for different types of M-dwarf stars
and the planetary gravity. We investigate the resulting effects on the spectral
appearance of molecular absorption bands, that are relevant as indicators for
potential planetary habitability during primary and secondary eclipse for
transiting terrestrial planets with Earth-like biomass emissions. Atmospheric
profiles are computed using a plane-parallel, 1D climate model coupled with a
chemistry model. We then calculate simulated spectra using a line-by-line
radiative transfer model. We find that emission spectra during secondary
eclipse show increasing absorption of methane, water and ozone for planets
orbiting quiet M0-M3 dwarfs and the active M-type star AD Leo compared to solar
type central stars. However, for planets orbiting very cool and quiet M dwarfs
(M4 to M7), increasing temperatures in the mid-atmosphere lead to reduced
absorption signals, making the detection of molecules more difficult in such
scenarios. Transmission spectra during primary eclipse show strong absorption
features of CH4, N2O and H2O for planets orbiting quiet M0-M7 stars and AD Leo.
The N2O absorption of an Earth-sized planet orbiting a quiet M7 star can even
be as strong as the CO2 signal. However, ozone absorption decreases for planets
orbiting such cool central stars due to chemical effects in the atmosphere. To
investigate the effect on the spectroscopic detection of absorption bands with
potential future satellite missions, we compute signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR)
for a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)-like aperture telescope.

Molecular Gas and Star Formation in Local Early-Type Galaxies","
Abstract: The molecular gas content of local early-type galaxies is constrained and
discussed in relation to their evolution. First, as part of the Atlas3D survey,
we present the first complete, large (260 objects), volume-limited single-dish
survey of CO in normal local early-type galaxies. We find a surprisingly high
detection rate of 22%, independent of luminosity and at best weakly dependent
on environment. Second, the extent of the molecular gas is constrained with CO
synthesis imaging, and a variety of morphologies is revealed. The kinematics of
the molecular gas and stars are often misaligned, implying an external gas
origin in over a third of the systems, although this behaviour is drastically
diffferent between field and cluster environments. Third, many objects appear
to be in the process of forming regular kpc-size decoupled disks, and a star
formation sequence can be sketched by piecing together multi-wavelength
information on the molecular gas, current star formation, and young stars.
Last, early-type galaxies do not seem to systematically obey all our usual
prejudices regarding star formation, following the standard Schmidt-Kennicutt
law but not the far infrared-radio correlation. This may suggest a greater
diversity in star formation processes than observed in disk galaxies. Using
multiple molecular tracers, we are thus starting to probe the physical
conditions of the cold gas in early-types.

band. The intrinsic pulse period was determined as 8.68878 \pm 0.00005 s, in
agreement with an extrapolation from previous measurements. The broadband
Suzaku spectra enabled a first simultaneous and accurate measurement of the
soft and hard components of this object by a single satellite. The former can
be reproduced by two blackbodies, or slightly better by a resonant cyclotron
scattering model. The hard component can be approximated by a power-law of
photon index \Gamma h ~0.9 when the soft component is represented by the
resonant cyclotron scattering model, and its high-energy cutoff is constrained
as >180 keV. Assuming an isotropic emission at a distance of 3.6 kpc, the
unabsorbed 1-10 keV and 10-70 keV luminosities of the soft and hard components
are calculated as 2.8e+35 erg s^{-1} and 6.8e+34 erg s^{-1}, respectively.
Their sum becomes ~10^3 times as large as the estimated spin-down luminosity.
On a time scale of 30 ks, the hard component exhibited evidence of variations

The extinction curves of star-forming regions from z=0.1 to 6.7 using  GRB afterglow spectroscopy","
Abstract: GRB afterglows are well suited to extinction studies due to their brightness,
simple power-law spectra and the occurrence of GRBs in distant star forming

41 GRB afterglows, from X-ray to NIR wavelengths. This is the largest sample of
extinction curves outside the Local Group and, to date, the only extragalactic
sample of absolute extinction curves based on spectroscopy. Visual extinction
correlation with HI column density as well as total and gas-phase metal column
density are examined. Approximately half the sample require a cooling break
between the optical and X-ray regimes. The broken power-law SEDs show an
average change in the spectral index of delta_beta=0.51 with a standard
deviation of 0.02. This is consistent with the expectation from a simple
synchrotron model. Of the sample, 63% are well described by the SMC-type
extinction curve and have moderate or low extinction, with AV<0.65. Almost a
quarter of our sample is consistent with no significant extinction (typically
AV<0.1). The 2175AA extinction bump is detected unequivocally in 7% of our
sample (3 GRBs), which all have A_V>1.0. We find an anti-correlation between
gas-to-dust ratio and metallicity consistent with the Local Group relation. Our
metals-to-dust ratios derived from the soft X-ray absorption are always larger
(3-30 times) than the Local Group value, which may mean that GRB hosts may be
less efficient at turning their metals into dust. However, we find that gas,
dust, and metal column densities are all likely to be influenced by
photo-ionization and dust destruction effects from the GRB. [abridged]

Slowly Breaking Waves: The Longevity of Tidally Induced Spiral Structure","
Abstract: We have discovered long-lived waves in two sets of numerical models of fast
(marginally bound or unbound) flyby galaxy collisions, carried out
independently with two different codes. In neither simulation set are the
spirals the result of a collision-induced bar formation. Although there is
variation in the appearance of the waves with time, they do not disappear and
reform recurrently, as seen in other cases described in the literature. We also
present an analytic theory that can account for the wave structure, not as
propagating transients, nor as a fixed pattern propagating through the disc.
While these waves propagate through the disc, they are maintained by the
coherent oscillations initiated by the impulsive disturbance. Specifically, the
analytic theory suggests that they are caustic waves in ensembles of stars
pursuing correlated epicyclic orbits after the disturbance. This theory is an
extension of that developed by Struck and collaborators for colliding ring
galaxies.
The models suggest that this type of wave may persist for a couple of Gyr.,
and galaxy interactions occur on comparable timescales, so waves produced by
the mechanism may be well represented in observed spirals. In particular, this
mechanism can account for the tightly wound, and presumably long-lived spirals,
seen in some nearby early-type galaxies. These spirals are also likely to be
common in groups and clusters, where fast encounters between galaxies occur
relatively frequently. However, as the spirals become tightly wound, and evolve
to modest amplitudes, they may be difficult to resolve unless they are nearby.
Nonetheless, the effect may be one of several processes that result from galaxy
harassment, and via wave-enhanced star formation contribute to the
Butcher-Oemler effect.

the evolution of the large-scale solar magnetic field and the open heliospheric

semi-synthetic sunspot group records reflect those of the observed the Royal

tilt angles. The reconstruction results for the total surface flux, the polar
field, and the heliospheric open flux (determined by a current sheet source
surface extrapolation) agree well with the available observational or
empirically derived data and reconstructions. We confirm a significant positive
correlation between the polar field during activity minimum periods and the
strength of the subsequent sunspot cycle, which has implications for flux
transport dynamo models for the solar cycle. Just prior to the Dalton minimum,
at the end of the 18th century, a long cycle was followed by a weak cycle. We
find that introducing a possibly `lost' cycle between 1793 and 1800 leads to a
shift of the minimum of the open flux by 15 years which is inconsistent with
the cosmogenic isotope record.

pulsars powered by rotating neutron stars (NSs). We predict for SGR 0418+5729 a
lower limit for its spin-down rate, $\dot{P} \geq L_X P^3/(4\pi^2 I)=1.18\times
10^{-16}$ where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the WD. We show for SGRs and
AXPs that, the occurrence of the glitch and the gain of rotational energy, is
due to the release of gravitational energy associated to the contraction and
decrease of the moment of inertia of the WDs. The steady emission and the
outburst following the glitch are explained by the loss of rotational energy of
the Wds, in view of the much larger moment of inertia of the WDs, as compared
to the one of NSs and/or quark stars. There is no need here to invoke the
unorthodox concept of magnetic energy release due to decay of overcritical
magnetic fields, as assumed in the magnetar model. A new astrophysical scenario
for the SGRs and AXPs associated to Supernova remnants is presented. The
observational campaigns of the X-ray Japanese satellite Suzaku on AE Aquarii
and the corresponding theoretical works by Japanese groups and recent results
of the Hubble Space Telescope, give crucial information for our theoretical
model. Follow-on missions of Hubble Telescope and VLT are highly recommended to
give further observational evidence of this most fundamental issue of
relativistic astrophysics: the identification of the true SGRs/AXPs energy
source.

"Title:
The stellar kinematics and populations of boxy bulges: cylindrical  rotation and vertical gradients","
Abstract: Boxy and peanut-shaped bulges are seen in about half of edge-on disc
galaxies. Comparisons of the photometry and major-axis gas and stellar
kinematics of these bulges to simulations of bar formation and evolution
indicate that they are bars viewed in projection. If the properties of boxy
bulges can be entirely explained by assuming they are bars, then this may imply
that their hosts are pure disc galaxies with no classical bulge. A handful of
these bulges, including that of the Milky Way, have been observed to rotate
cylindrically, i.e. with a mean stellar velocity independent of height above
the disc. In order to assess whether such behaviour is ubiquitous in boxy
bulges, and whether a pure disc interpretation is consistent with their stellar
populations, we have analysed the stellar kinematics and populations of the
boxy or peanut-shaped bulges in a sample of five edge-on galaxies. We placed
slits along the major axis of each galaxy and at three offset but parallel
positions to build up spatial coverage. The boxy bulge of NGC3390 rotates
perfectly cylindrically within the spatial extent and uncertainties of the
data. This is consistent with the metallicity and alpha-element enhancement of
the bulge, which are the same as in the disk. This galaxy is thus a pure disc
galaxy. The boxy bulge of ESO311-G012 also rotates very close to cylindrically.
The boxy bulge of NGC1381 is neither clearly cylindrically nor
non-cylindrically rotating, but it has a negative vertical metallicity gradient
and is alpha-enhanced with respect to its disc, suggesting a composite bulge
comprised of a classical bulge and bar (and possibly a discy pseudobulge)
[abridged] Even this relatively small sample is sufficient to demonstrate that
boxy bulges display a range of rotational and population properties, indicating
that they do not form a homogeneous class of object.

MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb: A massive planet orbiting an M dwarf","
Abstract: We report the discovery of a planet with a high planet-to-star mass ratio in
the microlensing event MOA-2009-BLG-387, which exhibited pronounced deviations
over a 12-day interval, one of the longest for any planetary event. The host is
an M dwarf, with a mass in the range 0.07 M_sun < M_host < 0.49M_sun at 90%
confidence. The planet-star mass ratio q = 0.0132 +- 0.003 has been measured
extremely well, so at the best-estimated host mass, the planet mass is m_p =
2.6 Jupiter masses for the median host mass, M = 0.19 M_sun. The host mass is
determined from two ""higher order"" microlensing parameters. One of these, the
angular Einstein radius \theta_E = 0.31 +- 0.03 mas, is very well measured, but
the other (the microlens parallax \pi_E, which is due to the Earth's orbital
motion) is highly degenate with the orbital motion of the planet. We
statistically resolve the degeneracy between Earth and planet orbital effects
by imposing priors from a Galactic model that specifies the positions and
velocities of lenses and sources and a Kepler model of orbits. The 90%
confidence intervals for the distance, semi-major axis, and period of the
planet are 3.5 kpc < D_L < 7.9 kpc, 1.1 AU < a < 2.7AU, and 3.8 yr < P < 7.6

Lensing by Kerr Black Holes. I: General Lens Equation and Magnification  Formula","
Abstract: We develop a unified, analytic framework for gravitational lensing by Kerr
black holes. In this first paper we present a new, general lens equation and
magnification formula governing lensing by a compact object. Our lens equation
assumes that the source and observer are in the asymptotically flat region and
does not require a small angle approximation. Furthermore, it takes into
account the displacement that occurs when the light ray's tangent lines at the
source and observer do not meet on the lens plane. We then explore our lens
equation in the case when the compact object is a Kerr black hole.
Specifically, we give an explicit expression for the displacement when the
observer is in the equatorial plane of the Kerr black hole as well as for the
case of spherical symmetry.

Black holes with current loops revisited","
Abstract: The electromagnetic field around a Kerr black hole inside a current loop is
sometimes used as the basis of a toy model for discussing the properties of
particle orbits near astrophysical black holes. The motivation for the present
paper is to correct the published solution to Maxwell's equations with a
charged current loop. Dipole approximations and closed-form expressions in the
extreme Kerr limit are also presented. Using the corrected solution, it turns
out that imposing a vanishing electromotive force produces a loop with a
potential which is finite everywhere outside the black hole. Ring solutions can
be combined into solutions with multiple rings or current discs.

"Title:
The Abundance Scatter in M33 from HII Regions: Is There Any Evidence for  Azimuthal Metallicity Variations?","
Abstract: Optical spectra of 25 H II regions in the inner two kpc of the M33 disk have
been obtained with the GMOS spectrograph at the Gemini North telescope. The
oxygen abundance gradient measured from the detection of the [O III]4363
auroral line displays a scatter of approximately 0.06 dex, a much smaller value
than recently reported by Rosolowsky & Simon in this galaxy. The analysis of
the abundances for a large sample of H II regions derived from the R23
strong-line indicator confirms that the scatter is small over the full disk of
M33, consistent with the measuring uncertainties, and comparable to what is
observed in other spiral galaxies. No evidence is therefore found for
significant azimuthal variations in the present-day metallicity of the
interstellar medium in this galaxy on spatial scales from ~100 pc to a few kpc.
A considerable fraction of M33 H II regions with auroral line detections show
spectral features revealing sources of hard ionizing radiation (such as He II
emission and large [Ne III], [O III] line fluxes). Since R23 is shown to
severely underestimate the oxygen abundances in such cases, care must be taken
in chemical abundance studies of extragalactic H II regions based on this
strong-line indicator.

"Title:
Early-type host galaxies of Type II and Ib Supernovae","
Abstract: Recent studies find that some early-type galaxies host Type II or Ibc
supernovae (SNe II, Ibc). This may imply recent star-formation activities in
these SNe host galaxies, but a massive star origin of the SNe Ib so far
observed in early-type galaxies has been questioned because of their intrinsic
faintness and unusually strong Ca lines shown in the nebular phase. To address
the issue, we investigate the properties of early-type SNe host galaxies using
the data with Galaxy Evolution Explore(GALEX) ultraviolet photometry, and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical data. Our sample includes eight SNe II
and one peculiar SN Ib (SN 2000ds) host galaxies as well as 32 SN Ia host
galaxies. The host galaxy of SN 2005cz, another peculiar SN Ib, is also
analysed using the GALEX data and the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)
optical data. We find that the NUV-optical colors of SN II/Ib host galaxies are
systematically bluer than those of SN Ia host galaxies, and some SN II/Ib host
galaxies with NUV-r colors markedly bluer than the others exhibit strong radio
emission. We perform a stellar population synthesis analysis and find a clear
signature of recent star-formation activities in most of the SN II/Ib host
galaxies. Our results generally support the association of the SNe II/Ib hosted
in early-type galaxies with core-collapse of massive stars. We briefly discuss
implications for the progenitors of the peculiar SNe Ib 2000ds and 2005cz.

Observational constraints on scalar field models of dark energy with  barotropic equation of state","
Abstract: We constrain the parameters of dynamical dark energy in the form of a
classical or tachyonic scalar field with barotropic equation of state jointly
with other cosmological ones using the combined datasets which include the CMB
power spectra from WMAP7, the baryon acoustic oscillations in the space
distribution of galaxies from SDSS DR7, the power spectrum of luminous red
galaxies from SDSS DR7 and the light curves of SN Ia from 2 different
compilations: Union2 (SALT2 light curve fitting) and SDSS (SALT2 and MLCS2k2
light curve fittings). It has been found that the initial value of dark energy
equation of state parameter is constrained very weakly by most of the data
while the rest of main cosmological parameters are well constrained: their
likelihoods and posteriors are similar, have the forms close to Gaussian (or
half-Gaussian) and their confidential ranges are narrow. The most reliable
determinations of the best fitting value and $1\sigma$ confidence range for the
initial value of dark energy equation of state parameter were obtained from the
combined datasets including SN Ia data from the full SDSS compilation with
MLCS2k2 fitting of light curves. In all such cases the best fitting value of
this parameter is lower than the value of corresponding parameter for current
epoch. Such dark energy loses its repulsive properties and in future the
expansion of the Universe will change into contraction. We also perform an
error forecast for the Planck mock data and show that they narrow essentially
the confidential ranges of cosmological parameters values, moreover, their
combination with SN SDSS compilation with MLCS2k2 light curve fitting may
exclude the fields with initial equation of state parameter $>-0.1$ at
2$\sigma$ confidential level.

the time delay between images are also given to second order in epsilon, again

conventional interpretations in terms of tube-like structures. The sheets are
perhaps related to magnetic tangential discontinuities, which Parker has argued
arise naturally in low-beta conditions. Some consequences of this suggestion,

to be a complete ring surrounding a roundish core. The nature of the outer ring
of Hoag-type galaxies is still debated and may be related either to slow
secular evolution or to environmental processes, such as galaxy-galaxy

follows well an r^1/4 light profile almost all the way to the centre, (b) the
isophotes are strongly twisted with a sharp 45 deg transition at a radius of
r~6 arcsec, (c) the blue ring seems to have reached near-equilibrium
configuration with the central body, (d) the ring is actually composed of a
one-and-a-half turn spiral feature, and (e) one side of the spiral shows
conspicuous star formation in the form of at least nine HII regions, revealed
by their H_alpha emission. Based on the photometric data, together with HI
information from the literature, we characterize UGC 4599 as an elliptical-like
object surrounded by a luminous ring and a massive, extremely extended HI disc.
Given its observed properties, we rule out UGC 4599 as representing a late
phase in barred early-type galaxies evolution. We discuss the origin of UGC
4599 and conclude that this galaxy could be the result of a major interaction
between two gas-rich spiral galaxies that took place at least 5 Gyr ago.
However, deep optical imaging and a detailed stellar population analysis are
required to determine whether the large gas reservoir could have been accreted
directly from the intergalactic medium onto a pre-existing elliptical galaxy in
the early Universe. A detailed kinematical study will shed light on the exact
nature of the central body and the ring of UGC 4599.

Abstract: To investigate statistically whether magnetic fields in massive stars are
ubiquitous or appear in stars with specific spectral classification, certain

observations for 36 stars. Among the observed sample roughly half of the stars
are probable members of clusters at different ages, whereas the remaining stars
are field stars not known to belong to any cluster or association.
Spectropolarimetric observations were obtained during three different nights
using the low-resolution spectropolarimetric mode of FORS2 (FOcal Reducer low
dispersion Spectrograph) mounted on the 8-m Antu telescope of the VLT. To
assess the membership in open clusters and associations, we used astrometric
catalogues with the best currently available kinematic and photometric data.
A field at a significance level of 3sigma was detected in ten O-type stars.
Importantly, the largest longitudinal magnetic fields were measured in two Of?p
stars: <B_z>=-381+-122G for CPD-282561 and <B_z>=-297+-62G for HD148937,
previously detected by us as magnetic. The obtained observations of HD148937 on
three different nights indicate that the magnetic field is slightly variable.
Our new measurements support our previous conclusion that large-scale organized
magnetic fields with polar field strengths in excess of 1kG are not widespread
among O-type stars. Among the stars with a detected magnetic field, only one
star, HD156154, belongs to an open cluster at high membership probability.

wealth of information can be obtained from RV/direct imaging overlap,

and direct imaging will become more important in the coming years as the phase
space probed by each technique converges. Future studies involving RV/imaging
overlap should be sure to consider the effects of a potential planet's

Abstract: The soft X-ray emission from high density plasma in CTTS is associated with
the accretion process. It is still unclear whether this high density cool

quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray observing campaign of the CTTS V2129 Oph
(Chandra/HETGS data to constrain the X-ray emitting plasma components, and
optical observations to constrain the characteristics of accretion and magnetic
field). We analyze a 200 ks Chandra/HETGS observation of V2129 Oph, subdivided
into two 100 ks segments, corresponding to two different phases within one
stellar rotation. The X-ray emitting plasma covers a wide range of
temperatures: 2-34 MK. The cool plasma component of V2129 Oph varies between
the two segments of the Chandra observation: high density plasma (log Ne ~
12.1) with high EM at ~ 3-4 MK is present during the 1st segment; during the
2nd segment this plasma component has lower EM and lower density (log Ne <
11.5), although the statistical significance of these differences is marginal.
Hotter plasma components, T > 10 MK, show variability on short time scales (~
10 ks), typical of coronal plasma. A clear flare, detected in the 1st segment,
could be located in a large coronal loop (> 3 Rstar). Our observation provides
further confirmation that the dense cool plasma at a few MK in CTTS is material
heated in the accretion shock. The variability of this cool plasma component on
V2129 Oph may be explained in terms of X-rays emitted in the accretion shock
and seen with different viewing angles at the two rotational phases probed by
our observation. During the 1st time interval direct view of the shock region
is possible, while, during the 2nd, the accretion funnel itself intersects the
line of sight to the shock region, preventing us from observing

Stochastic growth of quantum fluctuations during inflation","
Abstract: The standard field-theoretical approach to the slow-roll inflation is
introduced. We then show as, in order to calculate the mean square of the
canonical gauge invariant quantum fluctuations associated to a generic field,
the logarithm of the scale factor has to be used as the time variable in the
Fokker-Planck equation in the stochastic approach. Then we compute the growth
of different test fields with a small effective mass during slow-roll
inflationary models, comparing the results with the one for the gauge invariant
canonical fluctuation associated to the inflaton, the Mukhanov variable. We
find that in most of the single fields inflationary models such fluctuation
grows faster than any test field with a non-negative effective mass, with the
exception of hybrid models.

Dust Ejection from Planetary Bodies by Temperature Gradients: Laboratory  Experiments","
Abstract: Laboratory experiments show that dusty bodies in a gaseous environment eject
dust particles if they are illuminated. We find that even more intense dust
eruptions occur when the light source is turned off. We attribute this to a
compression of gas by thermal creep in response to the changing temperature
gradients in the top dust layers. The effect is studied at a light flux of 13
kW/(m*m) and 1 mbar ambient pressure. The effect is applicable to
protoplanetary disks and Mars. In the inner part of protoplanetary disks,
planetesimals can be eroded especially at the terminator of a rotating body.
This leads to the production of dust which can then be transported towards the
disk edges or the outer disk regions. The generated dust might constitute a
significant fraction of the warm dust observed in extrasolar protoplanetary
disks. We estimate erosion rates of about 1 kg/s for 100 m parent bodies. The
dust might also contribute to subsequent planetary growth in different
locations or on existing protoplanets which are large enough not to be
susceptible to particle loss by light induced ejection. Due to the ejections,
planetesimals and smaller bodies will be accelerated or decelerated and drift
outward or inward, respectively. The effect might also explain the entrainment
of dust in dust devils on Mars, especially at high altitudes where gas drag
alone might not be sufficient.

"Title:
Profiles of spectral lines from failed and decelerated winds from  neutron stars and black holes","
Abstract: We calculate profiles of spectral lines from an extended outflow from the
compact object (a black hole or a neutron star). We assume that the bulk
velocity of the flow increases during a short phase of acceleration and then
rapidly decreases forming a failed wind. We also study the wind which is only
decelerating. We show that depending on the relative strength of the
gravitational redshifting line profiles from such winds may be of several
types: distorted P-Cygni (emission and blueshifted absorption); W-shaped
(absorption-emission-absorption) and inverted P-Cygni (emission-redshifted
absorption). The latter case is expected from accretion flows where the
velocity is directed inwards; however, we show that inverted P-Cygni profile
can be produced by the failed wind, provided the line is formed within several
tens of Schwarzschild radii from the compact object.

Catalogue of known Galactic SNRs uncovered in HAalpa light","
Abstract: During detailed searches for new Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) in the
Anglo Australian Observatory/United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope (AAO/UKST) HAlpha
survey of the southern Galactic plane, we also uncovered, for the first time,
possible associated HAlpha emission in the vicinity of about 24 known Galactic
SNRs previously known solely from radio or X-ray observations.The possible
optical counterparts to these known SNR were detected due to the 1 arcsecond
resolution and 5 Rayleigh sensitivity of this HAlpha survey.
The newly discovered emission frequently exhibits the typical filamentary
form of other optically detected SNRs although sometimes the HAlpha emission
clouds or fragmented filaments largely inside an SNR extend over the radio
border. It is true that superposition of general diffuse and extended Galactic
emission in the region of these remnants is a complicating factor, but for many
optical candidates the HAlpha emission provides an excellent morphological and
positional match to the observed radio emission so that an association seems
clear.
We have already published HAlpha images and confirmatory spectral
observations for several of the best optical counterparts to known SNRs but for
completeness and convenience we include them in our complete catalogue of
previously known radio detected SNRs for which we have now uncovered HAlpha
optical emission. For better visualisation of the optical emissions from these
faint supernova remnants and to enhance some low surface-brightness features we
also present quotient images of the HAlpha data divided by the accompanying
broad-band short red (SR) data. Out of 274 Galactic SNRs currently catalogued
and detected in the radio only ~20 had previous optical counterparts. We may
have now increased this by a further third by adding a further 24 candidate
optical counterparts.

3D numerical simulations of photodissociated and photoionized disks","
Abstract: In this work we study the influence of the UV radiation field of a massive
star on the evolution of a disklike mass of gas and dust around a nearby star.
This system has similarities with the Orion proplyds. We study disks with
different inclinations and distances from the source, performing 3D numerical
simulations. We use the YGUAZ\'U-A adaptative grid code modified to account for
EUV/FUV fluxes and non-spherical mass distributions. We treat H and C
photoionization to reproduce the ionization fronts and photodissociation
regions observed in proplyds. We also incorporate a wind from the ionizing
source, to investigate the formation of the bow shock observed in several
proplyds. Our results show that a photoevaporated wind propagates from the disk
surface and becomes ionized after an ionization front (IF) seen as a bright
peak in Ha maps. We follow the development of an HI region inside the
photoevaporated wind which corresponds to a photodissociated region (PDR) for
most of our models, except those without a FUV flux. For disks that are at a
distance from the source d \geq 0.1 pc, the PDR is thick and the IF is detached
from the disk surface. In contrast, for disks that are closer to the source,
the PDR is thin and not resolved in our simulations. The IF then coincides with
the first grid points of the disk that are facing the ionizing photon source.
In both cases, the photoevaporated wind shocks (after the IF) with the wind
that comes from the ionizing source, and this interaction region is bright in
Ha. Our 3D models produce two emission features: a hemispherically shaped
structure (associated with the IF) and a detached bow shock where both winds
collide. A photodissociated region develops in all of the models exposed to the
FUV flux. More importantly, disks with different inclinations with respect to
the ionizating source have relatively similar photodissociation regions.

"Title:
Evidence for Black Hole Growth in Local Analogs to Lyman Break Galaxies","
Abstract: We have used XMM-Newton to observe six Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs): members of
the rare population of local galaxies that have properties that are very
similar to distant Lyman Break Galaxies. Our six targets were specifically
selected because they have optical emission-line properties that are
intermediate between starbursts and Type 2 (obscured) AGN. Our new X-ray data
provide an important diagnostic of the presence of an AGN. We find X-ray
luminosities of order 10^{42} erg/s and ratios of X-ray to far-IR luminosities
that are higher than values in pure starburst galaxies by factors ranging from
~ 3 to 30. This strongly suggests the presence of an AGN in at least some of
the galaxies. The ratios of the luminosities of the hard (2-10 keV) X-ray to [O
III]\lambda 5007 emission-line are low by about an order-of-magnitude compared
to Type 1 AGN, but are consistent with the broad range seen in Type 2 AGN.
Either the AGN hard X-rays are significantly obscured or the [O III] emission
is dominated by the starburst. We searched for an iron emission line at ~ 6.4
keV, which is a key feature of obscured AGN, but only detected emission at the
~ 2\sigma level. Finally, we find that the ratios of the mid-infrared (24\mu m)
continuum to [O III]\lambda 5007 luminosities in these LBAs are higher than the
values for Type 2 AGN by an average of 0.8 dex. Combining all these clues, we
conclude that an AGN is likely to be present, but that the bolometric
luminosity is produced primarily by an intense starburst. If these black holes
are radiating at the Eddington limit, their masses would lie in the range of
10^5 to 10^6 M_{sun}. These objects may offer ideal local laboratories to
investigate the processes by which black holes grew in the early universe.

"Title:
Measuring redshift through X-ray spectroscopy of galaxy clusters:  results from Chandra data and future prospects","
Abstract: The ubiquitous presence of the Fe line complex in the X-ray spectra of galaxy
clusters offers the possibility of measuring their redshift without resorting
to spectroscopic follow-up observations. In this paper we assess the accuracy
with which the redshift of galaxy clusters can be recovered from an X-ray
spectral analysis of Chandra archival data. This study indicates a strategy to
build large surveys of clusters whose identification and redshift measurement
are both based on X-ray data alone. We apply a blind search for K--shell and
L--shell Fe line complex in X-ray cluster spectra using Chandra archival
observations of galaxy clusters. The Fe line in the ICM spectra can be detected
by simply analyzing the C-statistics variation $\Delta C_{stat}$ as a function
of the redshift parameter. We repeat the measurement under different
conditions, and compare the X-ray derived redshift $z_X$ with the one obtained
by means of optical spectroscopy $z_o$. We explore how a number of priors on
metallicity and luminosity can be effectively used to reduce catastrophic
errors. The $\Delta C_{stat}$ provides the most efficient means for discarding
wrong redshift measures and to estimate the actual error on $z_X$. We identify
a simple and efficient procedure for optimally measuring the redshifts from the
X-ray spectral analysis of clusters of galaxies. When this procedure is applied
to mock catalogs extracted from high sensitivity, wide-area cluster surveys,
such as those proposed with Wide Field X-ray Telescope (WFXT) mission, it is
possible to obtain a complete samples of X-ray clusters with reliable redshift
measurements, thus avoiding time-consuming optical spectroscopic observations.
This methodology will make it possible to trace cosmic growth by studying the
evolution of the cluster mass function directly using X-ray data.

Modeling the total and polarized emission in evolving galaxies: ""spotty""  magnetic structures","
Abstract: Future radio observations with the SKA and its precursors will be sensitive
to trace spiral galaxies and their magnetic field configurations up to redshift
$z\approx3$. We suggest an evolutionary model for the magnetic configuration in
star-forming disk galaxies and simulate the magnetic field distribution, the
total and polarized synchrotron emission, and the Faraday rotation measures for
disk galaxies at $z\la 3$. Since details of dynamo action in young galaxies are
quite uncertain, we model the dynamo action heuristically relying only on
well-established ideas of the form and evolution of magnetic fields produced by
the mean-field dynamo in a thin disk. We assume a small-scale seed field which
is then amplified by the small-scale turbulent dynamo up to energy
equipartition with kinetic energy of turbulence. The large-scale galactic
dynamo starts from seed fields of 100 pc and an averaged regular field strength
of 0.02\,$\mu$G, which then evolves to a ""spotty"" magnetic field configuration
in about 0.8\,Gyr with scales of about one kpc and an averaged regular field
strength of 0.6\,$\mu$G. The evolution of these magnetic spots is simulated
under the influence of star formation, dynamo action, stretching by
differential rotation of the disk, and turbulent diffusion. The evolution of
the regular magnetic field in a disk of a spiral galaxy, as well as the
expected total intensity, linear polarization and Faraday rotation are
simulated in the rest frame of a galaxy at 5\,GHz and 150\,MHz and in the rest
frame of the observer at 150\,MHz. We present the corresponding maps for
several epochs after disk formation. (abridged)

Chemistry in Cosmic-Ray Dominated Regions (CRDRs)","
Abstract: Molecular line observations may serve as diagnostics of the degree to which
the number density of cosmic ray protons, having energies of 10s to 100s of
MeVs each, is enhanced in starburst galaxies and galaxies with active nuclei.
Results, obtained with the UCL\_PDR code, for the fractional abundances of
molecules as functions of the cosmic-ray induced ionisation rate, $\zeta$, are
presented. The aim is not to model any particular external galaxies. Rather, it
is to identify characteristics of the dependencies of molecular abundances on
$\zeta$, in part to enable the development of suitable observational programmes
for cosmic ray dominated regions (CRDRs) which will then stimulate detailed
modelling. For a number density of hydrogen nuclei of of $10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, and
high visual extinction, the fractional abundances of some species increase as
$\zeta$ increases to $10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$, but for much higher values of $\zeta$
the fractional abundances of all molecular species are significantly below
their peak values. We show in particular that OH, H$_{2}$O, H$_{3}^{+}$,
H$_{3}$O$^{+}$ and OH$^{+}$ attain large fractional abundances ($\geqslant
10^{-8}$) for $\zeta$ as large as $10^{-12}$ s$^{-1}$. HCO$^{+}$ is a poor
tracer of CRDRs when $\zeta > 10^{-13}$ s$^{-1}$. Sulphur-bearing species may
be useful tracers of CRDRs gas in which $\zeta \sim 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. Ammonia
has a large fractional abundance for $\zeta \leqslant 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ and
nitrogen appears in CN-bearing species at significant levels as $\zeta$
increases, even up to $\sim 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$. In this paper, we also discuss
our model predictions, comparing them to recent detections in both galactic and
extragalactic sources. We show that they agree well, to a first approximation,
with the observational constraints.

Metal-Poor Stars and the Chemical Enrichment of the Universe","
Abstract: Metal-poor stars hold the key to our understanding of the origin of the
elements and the chemical evolution of the Universe. This chapter describes the
process of discovery of these rare stars, the manner in which their surface
abundances (produced in supernovae and other evolved stars) are determined from
the analysis of their spectra, and the interpretation of their abundance
patterns to elucidate questions of origin and evolution. More generally,
studies of these stars contribute to other fundamental areas that include
nuclear astrophysics, conditions at the earliest times, the nature of the first
stars, and the formation and evolution of galaxies -- including our own Milky
Way. We illustrate this with results from studies of lithium formed during the
Big Bang; of stars dated to within ~1 Gyr of that event; of the most metal-poor
stars, with abundance signatures very different from all other stars; and of
the build-up of the elements over the first several Gyr. The combination of
abundance and kinematic signatures constrains how the Milky Way formed, while
recent discoveries of extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way's dwarf
galaxy satellites constrain the hierarchical build-up of its stellar halo from
small dark-matter dominated systems. [abridged]

"Title:
Supernovae in the Subaru Deep Field: the rate and delay-time  distribution of type Ia supernovae out to redshift 2","
Abstract: The type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate, when compared to the cosmic star
formation history (SFH), can be used to derive the delay-time distribution
(DTD) of SNe Ia, which can distinguish among progenitor models. We present the
results of a SN survey in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF). Over a period of 3
years, we have observed the SDF on 4 independent epochs with Suprime-Cam on the
Subaru 8.2-m telescope, with 2 nights of exposure per epoch, in the R, i', and
z' bands. We have discovered 150 SNe out to redshift z~2. Using 11 photometric
bands from the observer-frame far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, we derive
photometric redshifts for the SN host galaxies (for 24 we also have
spectroscopic redshifts). This information is combined with the SN photometry
to determine the type and redshift distribution of the SN sample. Our final
sample includes 28 SNe Ia in the range 1.0<z<1.5 and 10 in the range 1.5<z<2.0.
Our SN Ia rate measurements are consistent with those derived from the
HST/GOODS sample, but the overall uncertainty of our 1.5<z<2.0 measurement is a
factor of 2 smaller, of 35-50%. We find that the SN Ia rate evolution levels
off at 1.0<z<2.0, but shows no sign of declining. Combining our SN Ia rate
measurements and those from the literature, and comparing to a wide range of
possible SFHs, the best-fit DTD is a power law of the form Psi(t) ~ t^beta,
with beta = -1.1 +/- 0.1 (statistical) +/- 0.17 (systematic). This result is
consistent with other recent DTD measurements at various redshifts and
environments, and is in agreement with a generic prediction of the
double-degenerate progenitor scenario for SNe Ia. By combining the contribution
to iron production from core-collapse SNe, based on the wide range of SFHs,
with that from SNe Ia, calculated with the best-fit DTD, we predict that the
mean present-day cosmic iron abundance is in the range Z(Fe) = (0.09-0.37)

camera imaging at 150 GHz. Subsequently, an improved system has been developed

upgrades included dual-band optics allowing simultaneous imaging at 150 GHz and
220 GHz, faster sampling electronics enabling synchronous measurement of up to
112 pixels per measurement band, improved single-pixel sensitivity, and the
fabrication of a sky simulator to replicate conditions present at the

performance. An optical NEP was then calculated to be around 2 \dot 10-16
W/Hz1/2. This improvement in comparison with the 2009 run verifies that NIKA is
approaching the target sensitivity for photon-noise limited ground-based
detectors. Taking advantage of the larger arrays and increased sensitivity, a

Suitability of post-Newtonian/numerical-relativity hybrid waveforms for  gravitational wave detectors","
Abstract: This article presents a study of the sufficient accuracy of post-Newtonian
and numerical relativity waveforms for the most demanding usage case: parameter
estimation of strong sources in advanced gravitational wave detectors. For
black hole binaries, these detectors require accurate waveform models which can
be constructed by fusing an analytical post-Newtonian inspiral waveform with a
numerical relativity merger-ringdown waveform. We perform a comprehensive
analysis of errors that enter such ""hybrid waveforms"". We find that the
post-Newtonian waveform must be aligned with the numerical relativity waveform
to exquisite accuracy, about 1/100 of a gravitational wave cycle. Phase errors
in the inspiral phase of the numerical relativity simulation must be controlled
to less than about 0.1rad. (These numbers apply to moderately optimistic
estimates about the number of GW sources; exceptionally strong signals require
even smaller errors.) The dominant source of error arises from the inaccuracy
of the investigated post-Newtonian Taylor-approximants. Using our error
criterium, even at 3.5-th post-Newtonian order, hybridization has to be
performed significantly before the start of the longest currently available
numerical waveforms which cover 30 gravitational wave cycles. The current
investigation is limited to the equal-mass, zero-spin case and does not take
into account calibration errors of the gravitational wave detectors.

cluster masses and on the gravitational potential built on spherical collapse

"Title:
Cosmologies with a time dependent vacuum","
Abstract: The idea that the cosmological term, Lambda, should be a time dependent
quantity in cosmology is a most natural one. It is difficult to conceive an
expanding universe with a strictly constant vacuum energy density, namely one
that has remained immutable since the origin of time. A smoothly evolving
vacuum energy density that inherits its time-dependence from cosmological
functions, such as the Hubble rate or the scale factor, is not only a
qualitatively more plausible and intuitive idea, but is also suggested by
fundamental physics, in particular by quantum field theory (QFT) in curved
space-time. To implement this notion, is not strictly necessary to resort to ad
hoc scalar fields, as usually done in the literature (e.g. in quintessence
formulations and the like). A ""running"" Lambda term can be expected on very
similar grounds as one expects (and observes) the running of couplings and
masses with a physical energy scale in QFT. Furthermore, the experimental
evidence that the equation of state of the dark energy could be evolving with
time/redshift (including the possibility that it might currently behave
phantom-like) suggests that a time-variable Lambda term (possibly accompanied
by a variable Newton's gravitational coupling G=G(t)) could account in a
natural way for all these features. Remarkably enough, a class of these models
(the ""new cosmon"") could even be the clue for solving the old cosmological
constant problem, including the coincidence problem.

"Title:
On the Formation of Planetesimals via Secular Gravitational  Instabilities with Turbulent Stirring","
Abstract: We study the gravitational instability (GI) of small solids in a gas disk as
a mechanism to form planetesimals. Dissipation from gas drag introduces secular
GI, which proceeds even when standard GI criteria for a critical density or
Toomre's $Q$ predict stability. We include the stabilizing effects of turbulent
diffusion, which suppresses small scale GI. The radially wide rings that do
collapse contain up to $\sim 0.1$ Earth masses of solids. Subsequent
fragmentation of the ring (not modeled here) would produce a clan of chemically
homogenous planetesimals. Particle radial drift time scales (and, to a lesser
extent, disk lifetimes and sizes) restrict the viability of secular GI to disks
with weak turbulent diffusion, characterized by $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$. Thus
midplane dead zones are a preferred environment. Large solids with radii
$\gtrsim 10$ cm collapse most rapidly because they partially decouple from the
gas disk. Smaller solids, even below $\sim$ mm-sizes could collapse if
particle-driven turbulence is weakened by either localized pressure maxima or
super-Solar metallicity. Comparison with simulations that include particle
clumping by the streaming instability shows that our linear model underpredicts
rapid, small scale gravitational collapse. Thus the inclusion of more detailed
gas dynamics promotes the formation of planetesimals. We discuss relevant
constraints from Solar System and accretion disk observations.

Constraining the dark energy equation of state using LISA observations  of spinning Massive Black Hole binaries","
Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from coalescing Massive Black Hole (MBH) binaries
could be used as standard sirens to measure cosmological parameters. The future
space based gravitational wave observatory Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA) will detect up to a hundred of those events, providing very accurate
measurements of their luminosity distances. To constrain the cosmological
parameters we also need to measure the redshift of the galaxy (or cluster of
galaxies) hosting the merger. This requires the identification of a distinctive
electromagnetic event associated to the binary coalescence. However, putative
electromagnetic signatures may be too weak to be observed. Instead, we study
here the possibility of constraining the cosmological parameters by enforcing
statistical consistency between all the possible hosts detected within the
measurement error box of a few dozen of low redshift (z<3) events. We construct
MBH populations using merger tree realizations of the dark matter hierarchy in
a LambdaCDM Universe, and we use data from the Millennium simulation to model

Abstract: We present a physically-based absorption-line model for the spectroscopic

examine the resulting observational signatures of the absorbing gas with the
following ionization scenarios: collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE),
photoionization equilibrium, hybrid (photo- plus collisional ionization), and
non-equilibrium cooling. As a demonstration, we apply this model to new

Telescope of the IGM absorbers at z~0.1877 along the 1ES 1553+113 sight line.
We identify Ly alpha, C III, O VI, and N V absorption lines with two distinct
velocity components (blue at z_b=0.18757; red at z_r=0.18772) separated by
Delta(cz)/(1+z)~38 km/s. Joint analyses of these lines indicate that none of
the examined ionization scenarios can be applied with confidence to the blue
velocity component, although photoionization seems to play a dominant role. For
the red component, CIE can be ruled out, but pure photoionization and hybrid

Exploring The Galaxy Mass-Metallicity Relation at 3 < z < 5","
Abstract: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide a premier tool for studying
high-redshift star-forming galaxies thanks to their extreme brightness and
association with massive stars. Here we use GRBs to study the galaxy
mass-metallicity (M*-Z) relation at z~3-5, where conventional direct
metallicity measurements are extremely challenging. We use the interstellar
medium metallicities of long-duration GRB hosts derived from afterglow
absorption pectroscopy (Z~0.01-1 solar), in conjunction with host galaxy
stellar masses determined from deep Spitzer 3.6 micron observations of 20 GRB
hosts. We detect about 1/4 of the hosts with I-band absolute magnitudes, M ~
-21.5 to -22.5 AB mag, and place a limit of M>-19 mag on the remaining hosts
from a stacking analysis. Using a conservative range of mass-to-light ratios
for simple stellar populations (with ages of 70 Myr to ~ 2 Gyr), we infer the
host stellar masses and present the galaxy mass-metallicity measurements at z ~
3-5 (<z> ~ 3.5). We find that the detected GRB hosts, with M* ~ 2e10 solar
masses, display a wide range of metallicities, but that the mean metallicity at
this mass scale, Z~ 0.1 solar, is lower than measurements at z < 3. Combined
with stacking of the non-detected hosts (with M* < 4e9 solar masses and Z <
0.03 solar), we find evidence for the existence of an M*-Z relation at z ~ 3.5
and continued evolution of this relation to systematically lower metallicities
from z ~ 2.

Cosmic Microwave Background Delensing Revisited: Residual Biases and a  Simple Fix","
Abstract: The delensing procedure is an effective tool for removing lensing-induced
$B$-mode polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background to allow for deep
searches of primordial $B$-modes. However, the delensing algorithm existing in
the literature breaks down if the target $B$-mode signals overlap significantly
with the lensing $B$-mode ($\sim 300<l<2000$) in multipole-$l$ space. In this
paper, we identify the cause of the breakdown to be correlations between the
input $B$-map and the deflection field estimator ($EB$). The amplitude of this
bias is quantified by numerical simulations and compared to the analytically
derived functional form. We also propose a revised delensing procedure that
circumvents the bias. While the newly identified bias does not affect the
search of degree scale $B$-mode generated by tensor perturbations, the modified
delensing algorithm makes it possible to perform deep searches of high-$l$
$B$-modes such as those generated by patchy reionization, cosmic strings, or
rotation of polarization angles. Finally, we estimate how well future
polarization experiments can do in detecting tensor- and cosmic string-
generated $B$-mode after delensing and comment on different survey strategies.

"Title:
Baryon and Dark Matter Genesis from Strongly Coupled Strings","
Abstract: D3-brane probes of E-type Yukawa points lead to strongly coupled nearly
conformal sectors nearby the Standard Model (visible sector) which are
motivated by F-theory GUTs. Realistic visible sector brane configurations
induce a seesaw mass hierarchy in the hidden sector with light GUT singlets
charged under a strongly coupled hidden sector U(1). Interpreting these GUT
singlets as dark matter, this leads to a matter genesis scenario where the
freeze out and subsequent decay of heavy mediators between the two sectors
simultaneously populates comparable amounts of baryon and dark matter
asymmetry. Generating a net matter asymmetry requires a generational structure
in the probe sector which is absent at weak string coupling, but is
automatically realized at strong string coupling via towers of dyonic bound
states corresponding to multi-prong string junctions. The hidden U(1) couples
to the visible sector through both electric and magnetic kinetic mixing terms,
providing an efficient means to deplete the symmetric component of dark matter.
The mass of the dark matter is of order ~ 10 GeV. The dark matter mass and the
matter asymmetry are both controlled by the scale of conformal symmetry
breaking ~ 10^(9) - 10^(13) GeV, with the precise relation between the two set
by details of the visible sector brane configuration.

"Title:
Galaxy N-z Relation and CMB Spectrum Based on Cosmological Model with  Scalar Field Having Modified Potential Form","
Abstract: We have succeeded in establishing a cosmological model with a non-minimally
coupled scalar field $\phi$ that can account not only for the spatial
periodicity or the picket-fence structure exhibited by the galaxy $N$-$z$
relation of the 2dF survey, but also for the spatial power spectrum of the
cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) temperature anisotropy observed by
the WMAP satellite. The scalar field of our model universe starts from an
extremely small value at around the nucleosynthesis epoch, remains in that
state for sufficiently long periods, allowing sufficient time for the CMB
temperature anisotropy to form, and then starts to grow in magnitude at the
redshift $z$ of $\sim 1$, followed by a damping oscillation which is required
to reproduce the observed picket-fence structure of the $N$-$z$ relation. To
realize such behavior of the scalar field, we have found it necessary to
introduce a new form of potential $V(\phi)\propto \phi^2\exp(-q\phi^2)$, with
$q$ being a constant. Through this parameter $q$, we can control the epoch at
which the scalar field starts growing.

Detecting Vanishing Dimensions Via Primordial Gravitational Wave  Astronomy","
Abstract: Lower-dimensionality at higher energies has manifold theoretical advantages
as recently pointed out. Moreover, it appears that experimental evidence may
already exists for it - a statistically significant planar alignment of events
with energies higher than TeV has been observed in some earlier cosmic ray
experiments. We propose a robust and independent test for this new paradigm.
Since (2+1)-dimensional spacetimes have no gravitational degrees of freedom,
gravity waves cannot be produced in that epoch. This places a universal maximum
frequency at which primordial waves can propagate, marked by the transition
between dimensions. We show that this cut-off frequency may be accessible to
future gravitational wave detectors such as LISA.

Infrared Luminosity Functions of AKARI-SDSS Galaxies","
Abstract: By cross-correlating AKARI infrared (IR) sources with the SDSS galaxies, we
identified 2357 infrared galaxies with a spectroscopic redshift. This is not
just one of the largest samples of local IR galaxies, but AKARI provides
crucial FIR bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160um) in accurately measuring
galaxy SED across the peak of the dust emission at ~100um. By fitting modern IR
SED models to the AKARI photometry, we measured the total infrared luminosity
(L_IR) of individual galaxies more accurately. Using this L_IR, we constructed
luminosity functions of infrared galaxies at a median redshift of z=0.031, with
4 times larger sample than previous work. The LF agrees well with that at
z=0.0082 (RBGS), showing smooth and continuous evolution toward higher redshift
LFs measured in the AKARI NEP deep field. The derived local cosmic IR
luminosity density is Omega_IR=3.8x10^8 LsunMpc^-3. We separate galaxies into
AGN, star-forming, and composite by using the [NII]/Ha vs [OIII]/Hb line
ratios. The fraction of AGN shows a continuous increase with increasing L_IR
from 25% to 90% at 9<log L_IR<12.5. The SFR_Ha and L_[OIII] show good
correlations with L_IR for SFG (star-forming galaxies) and AGN, respectively.
The self-absorption corrected Ha/Hb ratio shows a weak increase with L_IR with
a substantial scatter. When we separate IR LFs into contributions from AGN and
SFG, the AGN contribution becomes dominant at L_IR>10^11Lsun, coinciding the
break of the both SFG and AGN IR LFs. At L_IR<10^11Lsun, SFG dominates IR Lfs.
Only 1.1% of Omega_IR is produced by LIRG, and only 0.03% is by ULIRG in the
local Universe. This work also provides the most accurate infrared luminosity
density of the local Universe to date. Compared with high redshift results from
the AKARI NEP deep survey, we observed a strong evolution of Omega_IR^SFG
~(1+z)^4.1+-0.4 and Omega_IR^AGN ~(1+z)^4.1+-0.5 (abridged).

Scattering Polarization of Hydrogen Lines in Weakly Magnetized Stellar  Atmospheres I. Formulation and Application to Isothermal Models","
Abstract: Although the spectral lines of hydrogen contain valuable information on the
physical properties of a variety of astrophysical plasmas, including the upper
solar chromosphere, relatively little is known about their scattering
polarization signals whose modification via the Hanle effect may be exploited
for magnetic field diagnostics. Here we report on a basic theoretical
investigation of the linear polarization produced by scattering processes and
the Hanle effect in Ly-a, Ly-b and H-a taking into account multilevel radiative
transfer effects in an isothermal stellar atmosphere model, the fine-structure
of the hydrogen levels, as well as the impact of collisions with electrons and
protons. The main aim of this first paper is to elucidate the physical
mechanisms that control the linear polarization in the three lines, as well as
its sensitivity to the perturbers density and to the strength and structure of
micro-structured and deterministic magnetic fields. To this end, we apply an
efficient radiative transfer code we have developed for performing numerical
simulations of the Hanle effect in multilevel systems with overlapping line
transitions. For low density plasmas such as that of the upper solar
chromosphere collisional depolarization is caused mainly by collisional
transitions between the fine-structure levels of n=3, so that it is virtually
insignificant for Ly-a but important for Ly-b and H-a. We show the impact of
the Hanle effect on the three lines taking into account the radiative transfer
coupling between the different hydrogen line transitions. For example, we
demonstrate that the linear polarization profile of the H-a line is sensitive
to the presence of magnetic field gradients in the line core formation region
and that in solar-like chromospheres selective absorption of polarization
components does not play any significant role on the emergent scattering
polarization.

High Performance Power Spectrum Analysis Using a FPGA Based  Reconfigurable Computing Platform","
Abstract: Power-spectrum analysis is an important tool providing critical information

Disequilibrium Carbon, Oxygen, and Nitrogen Chemistry in the Atmospheres  of HD 189733b and HD 209458b","
Abstract: We have developed 1-D photochemical and thermochemical kinetics and diffusion
models for the transiting exoplanets HD 189733b and HD 209458b to study the
effects of disequilibrium chemistry on the atmospheric composition of ""hot
Jupiters."" Here we investigate the coupled chemistry of neutral carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen species, and we compare the model results with
existing transit and eclipse observations. We find that the vertical profiles
of molecular constituents are significantly affected by transport-induced
quenching and photochemistry, particularly on cooler HD 189733b; however, the
warmer stratospheric temperatures on HD 209458b can help maintain
thermochemical equilibrium and reduce the effects of disequilibrium chemistry.
For both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are found to be
enhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few bar to less than a
mbar due to transport-induced quenching, but CH4 and NH3 are photochemically
removed at higher altitudes. Atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons
(particularly C2H2), some nitriles (particularly HCN), and radicals like OH,
CH3, and NH2 are enhanced overequilibrium predictions because of quenching and
photochemistry. In contrast, CO, H2O, N2, and CO2 more closely follow their
equilibrium profiles, except at pressures < 1 microbar, where CO, H2O, and N2
are photochemically destroyed and CO2 is produced before its eventual
high-altitude destruction. The enhanced abundances of HCN, CH4, and NH3 in
particular are expected to affect the spectral signatures and thermal profiles
HD 189733b and other, relatively cool, close-in transiting exoplanets. We
examine the sensitivity of our results to the assumed temperature structure and
eddy diffusion coefficientss and discuss further observational consequences of

Clues on the importance of comets in the origin and evolution of the  atmospheres of Titan and Earth","
Abstract: Earth and Titan are two planetary bodies formed far from each other.
Nevertheless the chemical composition of their atmospheres exhibits common
indications of being produced by the accretion, plus ulterior in-situ
processing of cometary materials. This is remarkable because while the Earth
formed in the inner part of the disk, presumably from the accretion of rocky
planetesimals depleted in oxygen and exhibiting a chemical similitude with
enstatite chondrites, Titan formed within Saturn's sub-nebula from oxygen- and
volatile-rich bodies, called cometesimals. From a cosmochemical and
astrobiological perspective the study of the H, C, N, and O isotopes on Earth
and Titan could be the key to decipher the processes occurred in the early
stages of formation of both planetary bodies. The main goal of this paper is to
quantify the presumable ways of chemical evolution of both planetary bodies, in
particular the abundance of CO and N2 in their early atmospheres. In order to
do that the primeval atmospheres and evolution of Titan and Earth have been
analyzed from a thermodynamic point of view. The most relevant chemical
reactions involving these species and presumably important at their early
stages are discussed. Then we have interpreted the results of this study in
light of the results obtained by the Cassini-Huygens mission on these species
and their isotopes. Given that H, C, N and O were preferentially depleted from
inner disk materials that formed our planet, the observed similitude of their
isotopic fractionation, and subsequent close evolution of Earth's and Titan's
atmospheres points towards a cometary origin of Earth atmosphere. Consequently,
our scenario also supports the key role of late veneers (comets and water-rich
carbonaceous asteroids) enriching the volatile content of the Earth at the time
of the Late Heavy Bombardment of terrestrial planets.

Misaligned And Alien Planets From Explosive Death Of Stars","
Abstract: Exoplanets whose orbit is misaligned with the spin of their host star could
have originated from high-speed gas blobs, which are observed in multitudes in
nearby supernova remnants and planetary nebulae. These blobs grow in mass and
slow down in the interstellar medium (ISM) by mass accretion and cool by
radiation. If their mass exceeds the Jeans mass, they collapse into hot giant
gas planets. Most of the 'missing baryons' in galaxies could have been swept
into such free-floating objects, which could perturb stellar planetary systems,
kick bound planets into misaligned orbits or be captured themselves into
misaligned orbits. The uncollapsed ones can then collapse or be tidally
disrupted into a tilted gas disk where formation of misaligned planets can take
place. Giant gas planets free floating in the Galactic ISM may be detected by
their microlensing effects or by deep photometry if they are hot. The
uncollapsed gas blobs may produce the observed radio scintillations of comact
extragalactic radio sources such as quasars and gamma ray bursts.

Abstract: The angular power spectrum and polarization of the cosmic microwave

baryons. However, only a small fraction of these baryons can be accounted for
in stars and gas inside galaxies, galaxy groups and galaxy clusters, and in
spectral-line absorbing gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Too hot to show
up in Lyman-absorption, too cool to cause detectable spectral distortions of
the cosmic microwave background radiation, and too diffused to emit detectable
X-rays, about 90% of the cosmic baryons remain missing in the local universe

Dynamo action and magnetic buoyancy in convection simulations with  vertical shear","
Abstract: A hypothesis for sunspot formation is the buoyant emergence of magnetic flux
tubes created by the strong radial shear at the tachocline. In this scenario,
the magnetic field has to exceed a threshold value before it becomes buoyant
and emerges through the whole convection zone. We follow the evolution of a
random seed magnetic field with the aim of study under what conditions it is
possible to excite the dynamo instability and whether the dynamo generated
magnetic field becomes buoyantly unstable and emerges to the surface as
expected in the flux-tube context. We perform numerical simulations of
compressible turbulent convection that include a vertical shear layer. Like the
solar tachocline, the shear is located at the interface between convective and
stable layers. We find that shear and convection are able to amplify the
initial magnetic field and form large-scale elongated magnetic structures. The
magnetic field strength depends on several parameters such as the shear
amplitude, the thickness and location of the shear layer, and the magnetic
Reynolds number ($\Rm$). Whenever the toroidal magnetic field reaches
amplitudes greater a threshold value which is close to the equipartition value,
it becomes buoyant and rises into the convection zone where it expands and
forms mushroom shape structures. Some events of emergence, i.e. those with the
largest amplitudes of the initial field, are able to reach the very uppermost
layers of the domain. These episodes are able to modify the convective pattern
forming either broader convection cells or convective eddies elongated in the
direction of the field. However, in none of these events the field preserves
its initial structure.

In this paper we identify a sample of [OII]3727 emission line objects at
redshift z~1.85 in a co-moving volume of ~4100 Mpc^3. Objects are selected
using an observed equivalent width (EW_obs) threshold of EW_obs = 50 angstroms.

this improved extinction correction into the star formation rate density

illustrate this by calculating the corrections to the non-Gaussianity parameter
f_NL coming from long-wavelength tensor modes. In our approach, the IR
corrections automatically emerge in a resummed, all-orders form. For the scalar
corrections, the resulting all-orders expression can be evaluated explicitly.

Optical spectroscopic variability of Herbig Ae/Be stars","
Abstract: We analysed 337 multi-epoch optical spectra of 38 Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars

at 10% of peak intensity (W10) and profile shapes were also measured and
classified. The mean line strengths and relative variabilities were quantified
for each star. Simultaneous optical photometry was used to estimate the line
fluxes.
We present a homogeneous spectroscopic database of HAeBe stars. The lines are
variable in practically all stars and timescales, although 30 % of the objects
show a constant EW in [OI]6300, which is also the only line that shows no
variability on timescales of hours. The HeI5876 and NaID EW relative
variabilities are typically the largest, followed by those in [OI]6300 and
Halpha. The EW changes can be larger than one order of magnitude for the
HeI5876 line, and up to a factor 4 for Halpha. The [OI]6300 and Halpha EW
relative variabilities are correlated for most stars in the sample. The Halpha
mean EW and W10 are uncorrelated, as are their relative variabilities. The
Halpha profile changes in 70 % of the objects. The massive stars in the sample
usually show more stable Halpha profiles with blueshifted self-absorptions and
less variable 10% widths.
Our data suggest multiple causes for the different line variations, but the
[OI]6300 and Halpha variability must share a similar origin in many objects.
The physical mechanism responsible for the Halpha line broadening does not
depend on the amount of emission; unlike in lower-mass stars, physical
properties based on the Halpha luminosity and W10 would significantly differ.
Our results provide additional support to previous works that reported
different physical mechanisms in Herbig Ae and Herbig Be stars.

dominated sources show a clear trend in the f_x/f_R vs. R-K and f_24um/f_R vs.
R-K diagrams, while the hosts follow the behaviour of non X-ray detected
galaxies. In the optical-near-infrared colour-magnitude diagram we see that the
known trend of redder objects being more obscured in X-rays is stronger for
AGN-dominated than for host-dominated systems. This is an indication that the
trend is more related to the AGN contaminating the overall colours than any
evolutionary effects. Finally, we find that a significant fraction (~30%) of
the reddest AGN are not obscured in X-rays.

moment values are compared with values for related molecules both from
experiment and from quantum chemical calculations.

"Title:
Direct Imaging of Fine Structures in Giant Planet Forming Regions of the  Protoplanetary Disk around AB Aurigae","
Abstract: We report high-resolution 1.6 $\micron$ polarized intensity ($PI$) images of
the circumstellar disk around the Herbig Ae star AB Aur at a radial distance of
22 AU ($0.""15$) up to 554 AU (3.$""$85), which have been obtained by the
high-contrast instrument HiCIAO with the dual-beam polarimetry. We revealed
complicated and asymmetrical structures in the inner part ($\lesssim$140 AU) of
the disk, while confirming the previously reported outer ($r$ $\gtrsim$200 AU)
spiral structure. We have imaged a double ring structure at $\sim$40 and
$\sim$100 AU and a ring-like gap between the two. We found a significant
discrepancy of inclination angles between two rings, which may indicate that
the disk of AB Aur is warped. Furthermore, we found seven dips (the typical
size is $\sim$45 AU or less) within two rings as well as three prominent $PI$
peaks at $\sim$40 AU. The observed structures, including a bumpy double ring, a
ring-like gap, and a warped disk in the innermost regions, provide essential
information for understanding the formation mechanism of recently detected
wide-orbit ($r$ $>$20 AU) planets.

"Title:
Propagation and oblique collision of electron-acoustic solitons in  two-electron-populated quantum plasmas","
Abstract: Oblique interaction of small- but finite-amplitude KdV-type electron-acoustic
solitary excitations is examined in an unmagnetized two-electron-populated
degenerate quantum electron-ion plasma in the framework of quantum
hydrodynamics model using the extended Poincar\'{e}-Lighthill-Kuo (PLK)
perturbation method. Critical plasma parameter is found to distinguish the
types of solitons and their interaction phase-shifts. It is shown that,
depending on the critical quantum diffraction parameter $H_{cr}$, both
compressive and rarefactive solitary excitations may exist in this plasma and
their collision phase-shifts can be either positive or negative for the whole
range of the collision angle $0<\theta<\pi$.

"Title:
Spectropolarimetric Evidence for Radiatively Inefficient Accretion in an  Optically Dull Active Galaxy","
Abstract: We present Subaru/FOCAS spectropolarimetry of two active galaxies in the
Cosmic Evolution Survey. These objects were selected to be optically dull, with
the bright X-ray emission of an AGN but missing optical emission lines in our
previous spectroscopy. Our new observations show that one target has very weak
emission lines consistent with an optically dull AGN, while the other object
has strong emission lines typical of a host-diluted Type 2 Seyfert galaxy. In
neither source do we observe polarized emission lines, with 3-sigma upper
limits of P_BLR < 2%. This means that the missing broad emission lines (and
weaker narrow emission lines) are not due to simple anisotropic obscuration,
e.g., by the canonical AGN torus. The weak-lined optically dull AGN exhibits a
blue polarized continuum with P = 0.78 +/- 0.07% at 4400 A < lambda_rest < 7200
A (P = 1.37 +/- 0.16% at 4400 A < lambda_rest < 5050 A). The wavelength
dependence of this polarized flux is similar to that of an unobscured AGN
continuum and represents the intrinsic AGN emission, either as synchrotron
emission or the outer part of an accretion disk reflected by a clumpy dust
scatterer. Because this intrinsic AGN emission lacks emission lines, this
source is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow.

"Title:
The Angular Momenta of Neutron Stars and Black Holes as a Window on  Supernovae","
Abstract: It is now clear that a subset of supernovae display evidence for jets and are
observed as gamma-ray bursts. The angular momentum distribution of massive
stellar endpoints provides a rare means of constraining the nature of the
central engine in core-collapse explosions. Unlike supermassive black holes,
the spin of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems is little affected
by accretion, and accurately reflects the spin set at birth. A modest number of
stellar-mass black hole angular momenta have now been measured using two
independent X-ray spectroscopic techniques. In contrast, rotation-powered
pulsars spin-down over time, via magnetic braking, but a modest number of natal
spin periods have now been estimated. For both canonical and extreme neutron
star parameters, statistical tests strongly suggest that the angular momentum
distributions of black holes and neutron stars are markedly different. Within
the context of prevalent models for core-collapse supernovae, the angular
momentum distributions are consistent with black holes typically being produced
in GRB-like supernovae with jets, and with neutron stars typically being
produced in supernovae with too little angular momentum to produce jets via
magnetohydrodynamic processes. It is possible that neutron stars are imbued
with high spin initially, and rapidly spun-down shortly after the supernova
event, but the available mechanisms may be inconsistent with some observed
pulsar properties.

"Title:
Overview of the European Underground Facilities","
Abstract: Deep underground laboratories are the only places where the extremely low
background radiation level required for most experiments looking for rare
events in physics and astroparticle physics can be achieved. Underground sites
are also the most suitable location for very low background gamma-ray
spectrometers, able to assay trace radioactive contaminants. Many operational
infrastructures are already available worldwide for science, differing for
depth, dimension and rock characteristics. Other underground sites are emerging
as potential new laboratories. In this paper the European underground sites are
reviewed, giving a particular emphasis on their relative strength and
complementarity. A coordination and integration effort among the European Union
underground infrastructures was initiated by the EU-funded ILIAS project and
proved to be very effective.

"Title:
A lack of close binaries among hot horizontal branch stars in globular  clusters. II. NGC\,2808","
Abstract: Models based on their binary origin have been very successful in reproducing
the properties of field subdwarf-B stars, but the observations of their
analogues in globular clusters has posed new problems, while the discovery of
multiple populations offered an appealing alternative scenario for the
formation of these stars. We search for binaries of period P<200 days among a
sample of blue horizontal branch stars (Teff=12000-22000 K) in NGC2808, a
cluster known to host three distinct stellar populations and a multimodal
horizontal branch. The final sample consists of 64 targets. The radial velocity
of the targets was measured in fourteen epochs, spanning a temporal interval of
about 75 days. We detect no RV variable object among stars cooler than the
photometric G1 gap at 17000 K, while two close (P<10 days) and two
intermediate-period (P=10-50 days) systems are found among hotter targets. The
close and intermediate-period binary fraction for stars cooler than the gap are
fc<5% and fip<10%, respectively, with 95% confidence. The most probable values
among hotter stars are fc~20% and fip~30%, but the 90%- confidence level
intervals are large (6-42% and 11-72%, respectively). The G1 gap appears as a
discontinuity in the binary faction, with a higher incidence of binaries among
hotter stars, but a constant increase in f with temperature rather than a
discontinuity cannot be excluded from our observations. We find that
intermediate-period binaries, never investigated before among cluster HB stars,
could play an important role, being more than ~15-20% of the hottest stars of
our sample. Our results indicate that fc among hot HB stars is most probably
higher for younger clusters, confirming the recently proposed age-fc relation.
However, the large observed difference in binary fraction between clusters
(e.g. NGC2808 and NGC6752) is still not reproduced by binary population
synthesis models.

"Title:
Number-Theory Dark Matter","
Abstract: We propose that the stability of dark matter is ensured by a discrete
subgroup of the U(1)B-L gauge symmetry, Z_2(B-L). We introduce a set of chiral
fermions charged under the U(1)B-L in addition to the right-handed neutrinos,
and require the anomaly-cancellation conditions associated with the U(1)B-L
gauge symmetry. We find that the possible number of fermions and their charges
are tightly constrained, and that non-trivial solutions appear when at least
five additional chiral fermions are introduced. The Fermat theorem in the
number theory plays an important role in this argument. Focusing on one of the
solutions, we show that there is indeed a good candidate for dark matter, whose
stability is guaranteed by Z_2(B-L).

"Title:
Plume Development of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 Comet Impact","
Abstract: We have studied plume formation after a Jovian comet impact using the ZEUS-MP
2 hydrodynamics code. The three-dimensional models followed objects with 500,
750, and 1000 meter diameters. Our simulations show the development of a fast,
upward-moving component of the plume in the wake of the impacting comet that
""pinches off"" from the bulk of the cometary material ~50 km below the 1 bar
pressure level, ~100 km above the depth of greatest mass and energy deposition.
The fast-moving component contains about twice the mass of the initial comet,
but consists almost entirely (>99.9%) of Jovian atmosphere rather than cometary
material. The ejecta rise mainly along the impact trajectory, but an additional
vertical velocity component due to buoyancy establishes itself within seconds
of impact, leading to an asymmetry in the ejecta with respect to the entry
trajectory. The mass of the upward-moving component follows a velocity
distribution M(>v) approximately proportional to v^-1.4 (v^-1.6 for the 750 m
and 500 m cases) in the velocity range 0.1 < v < 10 km/s.

"Title:
A Constraint on the Organization of the Galactic Center Magnetic Field  Using Faraday Rotation","
Abstract: We present new 6 and 20 cm Very Large Array (VLA) observations of polarized
continuum emission of roughly 0.5 square degrees of the Galactic center (GC)
region. The 6 cm observations detect diffuse linearly-polarized emission
throughout the region with a brightness of roughly 1 mJy per 15""x10"" beam. The
Faraday rotation measure (RM) toward this polarized emission has structure on
degree size scales and ranges from roughly +330 rad/m2 east of the dynamical
center (Sgr A) to -880 rad/m2 west of the dynamical center. This RM structure
is also seen toward several nonthermal radio filaments, which implies that they
have a similar magnetic field orientation and constrains models for their
origin. Modeling shows that the RM and its change with Galactic longitude are
best explained by the high electron density and strong magnetic field of the GC
region. Considering the emissivity of the GC plasma shows that while the
absolute RM values are indirect measures of the GC magnetic field, the RM
longitude structure directly traces the magnetic field in the central
kiloparsec of the Galaxy. Combining this result with previous work reveals a
larger RM structure covering the central ~2 degrees of the Galaxy. This RM
structure is similar to that proposed by Novak and coworkers, but is shifted
roughly 50 pc west of the dynamical center of the Galaxy. If this RM structure
originates in the GC region, it shows that the GC magnetic field is organized
on ~300 pc size scales. The pattern is consistent with a predominantly poloidal
field geometry, pointing from south to north, that is perturbed by the motion
of gas in the Galactic disk.
