Title:Accretion and Outflow in V404 Cyg,"
Abstract:  We study the optical evolution of the 2015 outburst in V404 Cyg, with
emphasis on the peculiar nebular phase and subsequent decay to quiescence. From
the decay timescale of the Balmer emission associated with the nebula we
measure an outflow mass M_wind~4x10^{-6} Msun. Remarkably, this is ~100 times
larger than the accreted mass and ~10% of the total mass stored in the disc.
The wind efficiency must therefore be significantly larger than previous
estimates for black hole transients, suggesting that radiation pressure (in
addition to other mechanisms such as Compton-heating) plays a key role in V404
Cyg. In addition, we compare the evolution of the 2015 and 1989 outbursts and
find clear similarities (namely a large luminosity drop ~10 d after the X-ray
trigger, followed by a brief nebular phase) but also remarkable differences in
decay timescales and long-term evolution of the Halpha profile. In particular,
we see evidence for a rapid disc contraction in 2015, consistent with a burst
of mass transfer. This could be driven by the response of the companion to hard
X-ray illumination, most notably during the last gigantic (super-Eddington)
flare on 25 June 2015. We argue that irradiation and consequential disc wind
are key factors to understand the different outburst histories in 1989 and
2015. In the latter case, radiation pressure may be responsible for the abrupt
end of the outburst through depleting inner parts of the disc, thus quenching
accretion and X-ray irradiation. We also present a refined orbital period and
updated ephemeris.

Title:Testing gravity with interstellar precursor missions,"
Abstract:  We consider how the trajectory of an interstellar precursor mission would be
affected by the gravity of the Sun in Newtonian and Milgromian dynamics (MOND).
The Solar gravity is ${\approx 50\%}$ stronger in MOND beyond a distance of
${\approx 7000}$ astronomical units, the MOND radius of the Sun. A spacecraft
travelling at $0.01 \, c$ reaches this distance after 11.1 years. We show that
the extra gravity in MOND causes an anomalous deceleration that reduces its
radial velocity by ${\approx 3}$ cm/s and the two-way light travel time from
the inner Solar System by ${\approx 0.1}$ seconds after 20 years. A distinctive
signature of MOND is that the gravity from the Sun is not directly towards it.
This is due to the non-linear nature of MOND and the external gravitational
field from the rest of the Galaxy, which we self-consistently include in our
calculations. As a result, the sky position of the spacecraft would deviate by
up to 0.2 mas over 20 years. This deviation is always in the plane containing
the spacecraft trajectory and the direction towards the Galactic Centre. By
launching spacecraft in different directions, it is possible to test the
characteristic pattern of angular deviations expected in MOND. This would
minimize the chance that any detected anomalies are caused by other processes
like drag from the interstellar medium. Such confounding factors could also be
mitigated using an onboard accelerometer to measure non-gravitational forces.
We briefly discuss how the gravity theories could be conclusively distinguished
using a Cavendish-style active gravitational experiment beyond the Sun's MOND
radius.

Title:The MOSDEF Survey: Direct-Method Metallicities and ISM Conditions at $z\sim1.5-3.5$,"
Abstract:  We present detections of [OIII]$\lambda$4363 and direct-method metallicities
for star-forming galaxies at $z=1.7-3.6$. We combine new measurements from the
MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey with literature sources to
construct a sample of 18 galaxies with direct-method metallicities at $z>1$,
spanning $7.5<1$2+log(O/H$)<8.2$ and log(M$_*$/M$_{\odot})=7-10$. We find that
strong-line calibrations based on local analogs of high-redshift galaxies
reliably reproduce the metallicity of the $z>1$ sample on average. We construct
the first mass-metallicity relation at $z>1$ based purely on direct-method O/H,
finding a slope that is consistent with strong-line results. Direct-method O/H
evolves by $\lesssim0.1$ dex at fixed M$_*$ and SFR from $z\sim0-2.2$. We
employ photoionization models to constrain the ionization parameter and
ionizing spectrum in the high-redshift sample. Stellar models with super-solar
O/Fe and binary evolution of massive stars are required to reproduce the
observed strong-line ratios. We find that the $z>1$ sample falls on the
$z\sim0$ relation between ionization parameter and O/H, suggesting no evolution
of this relation from $z\sim0$ to $z\sim2$. These results suggest that the
offset of the strong-line ratios of this sample from local excitation sequences
is driven primarily by a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity
compared to what is typical at $z\sim0$, naturally explained by super-solar
O/Fe at high redshift caused by rapid formation timescales. Given the extreme
nature of our $z>1$ sample, the implications for representative $z\sim2$ galaxy
samples at $\sim10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ are unclear, but similarities to $z>6$
galaxies suggest that these conclusions can be extended to galaxies in the
epoch of reionization.

Title:Predicting the LISA white dwarf binary population in the Milky Way with cosmological simulations,"
Abstract:  Short-period (P<1 hour) white dwarf binaries will be the most numerous
sources for the space-based gravitational wave detector LISA. Based on
thousands of resolved systems, we will be able to constrain binary evolution
and provide a new map of the Milky Way and its surroundings. Here we predict
the main properties of populations of different types of detached white dwarf
binaries detected by LISA. For the first time, we combine a high-resolution
cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy (from the FIRE project) with
a binary population synthesis model for low and intermediate mass stars. Our
model therefore provides a cosmologically realistic star formation and
metallicity history for the galaxy and naturally produces its different
components such as the thin and thick disk, the bulge, the stellar halo, and
satellite galaxies and streams. With the simulation, we show how different
galactic components contribute differently to the gravitational wave signal,
due to their typical age and distance distributions. We find that the dominant
LISA sources will be He-He systems and He-CO systems with important
contributions from the thick disk and bulge but also a few systems in the
stellar halo. The resulting sky map of the sources is different from previous
models, with important consequences for the searches for electromagnetic
counterparts and data analysis. We also emphasize that much of the
science-enabling information regarding white dwarf binaries, such as the chirp
mass and the sky localisation, becomes increasingly rich with long
observations, including an extended mission up to 8 years.

Title:Dark matter heating of gas accreting onto Sgr A$^*$,"
Abstract:  We study effects of heating by dark matter (DM) annihilation on black hole
gas accretion. We observe that, for reasonable assumptions about DM densities
in spikes around supermassive black holes, as well as DM masses and
annihilation cross-sections within the standard WIMP model, heating by DM
annihilation may have an appreciable effect on the accretion onto Sgr A$^*$ in
the Galactic center. Motivated by this observation we study the effects of such
heating on Bondi accretion, i.e. spherically symmetric, steady-state Newtonian
accretion onto a black hole. We consider different adiabatic indices for the
gas, and different power-law exponents for the DM density profile. We find that
typical transonic solutions with heating have a significantly reduced accretion
rate. However, for many plausible parameters, transonic solutions do not exist,
suggesting a breakdown of the underlying assumptions of steady-state Bondi
accretion. Our findings indicate that heating by DM annihilation may play an
important role in the accretion onto supermassive black holes at the center of
galaxies, and may help explain the low accretion rate observed for Sgr A$^*$.

Title:Fast Radio Bursts from Magnetars Born in Binary Neutron Star Mergers and Accretion Induced Collapse,"
Abstract:  Recently born magnetars are promising candidates for the engines powering
fast radio bursts (FRBs). The focus thus far has been placed on millisecond
magnetars born in rare core-collapse explosions, motivated by the star forming
dwarf host galaxy of the repeating FRB 121102, which is remarkably similar to
the hosts of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long gamma-ray bursts (LGRB).
However, long-lived magnetars may also be created in binary neutron star (BNS)
mergers, in the small subset of cases with a sufficiently low total mass for
the remnant to avoid collapse to a black hole, or in the accretion-induced
collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf. A BNS FRB channel will be characterized by
distinct host galaxy and spatial offset distributions than the SLSNe/LGRB
channel; we anticipate a similar host population, although possibly different
offset distribution for AIC events. We show that both the BNS and AIC channels
are consistent with the recently reported FRB 180924, localized by ASKAP to a
massive quiescent host galaxy with an offset of about 1.4 effective radii.
Using models calibrated to FRB 121102, we make predictions for the dispersion
measure, rotation measure, and persistent radio emission from magnetar FRB
sources born in BNS mergers or AIC, and show these are consistent with upper
limits from FRB 180924 for reasonable parameters. Depending on the rate of AIC,
and the fraction of BNS mergers leaving long-lived stable magnetars, the birth
rate of repeating FRB sources associated with older stellar populations could
be comparable to that of the core-collapse channel. We also discuss potential
differences in the repetition properties of these channels, as a result of
differences in the characteristic masses and magnetic fields of the magnetars.

Title:Observing cosmological binary mergers with next generation neutrino and gravitational wave detectors,"
Abstract:  We discuss the potential of detecting thermal neutrinos from matter-rich
binary mergers, via a decades-long multi-messenger campaign involving a
Mt-scale water Cherenkov neutrino detector and one or more next generation
gravitational wave detectors, capable of observing mergers up to redshift
$z\sim 2$. The search of neutrinos in time-coincidence with gravitational wave
detections will allow to identify single neutrinos from individual mergers
above the background, and to study their distributions in energy, redshift and
type (double neutron-star or neutron-star-black hole merger) of the candidate
sources. We find that, for merger rates consistent with current LIGO-Virgo
constraints, and for a $100~{\rm Mt\cdot yr}$ exposure, between ${\mathcal
O(10^{-1})}$ and ${\mathcal O(10)}$ neutrino events are expected. For extreme
cases of mergers with more than $10^{52}$ ergs emitted in $\mathrel{{\bar
\nu}_e}$, the number of events can be as large as $\sim 100$, with sensitivity
to mergers up to redshift $z\sim 0.5$ or so. Such scenarios can already be
tested with a $10~{\rm Mt\cdot yr}$ exposure, resulting in constraints on the
post-merger evolution of the systems being considered.

Title:The Reconstructed Power Spectrum in the Zeldovich Approximation,"
Abstract:  Density-reconstruction sharpens the baryon acoustic oscillations signal by
undoing some of the smoothing incurred by nonlinear structure formation. In
this paper we present an analytical model for reconstruction based on the
Zeldovich approximation, which for the first time includes a complete set of
counterterms and bias terms up to quadratic order and can fit real and
redshift-space data pre- and post-reconstruction data in both Fourier and
configuration space over a wide range of scales. We compare our model to n-body
data at $z = 0$ from the {\tt DarkSky} simulation \cite{skillman14}, finding
sub-percent agreement in both real space and in the redshift-space power
spectrum monopole out to $k = 0.4\ h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and out to $k = 0.2\ h$
Mpc$^{-1}$ in the quadrupole, with comparable agreement in configuration space.
We compare our model with several popular existing alternatives, updating
existing theoretical results for exponential damping in wiggle/no-wiggle splits
of the BAO signal and discuss the usually-ignored effect of higher bias
contributions on the reconstructed signal. In the appendices, we re-derive the
former within our formalism, present exploratory results on higher-order
corrections due to nonlinearities inherent to reconstruction, and present
numerical techniques with which to calculate the redshift-space power spectrum
of biased tracers within the Zeldovich approximation.

Title:A Survey for New Members of Taurus from Stellar to Planetary Masses,"
Abstract:  We present a large sample of new members of the Taurus star-forming region
that extend from stellar to planetary masses. To identify candidate members at
substellar masses, we have used color-magnitude diagrams and proper motions
measured with several wide-field optical and infrared (IR) surveys. At stellar
masses, we have considered the candidate members that were found in a recent
analysis of high-precision astrometry from the Gaia mission. Using new and
archival spectra, we have measured spectral types and assessed membership for
these 161 candidates, 79 of which are classified as new members. Our updated
census of Taurus now contains 519 known members. According to Gaia data, this
census should be nearly complete for spectral types earlier than M6-M7 at
A_J<1. For a large field encompassing ~72% of the known members, the census
should be complete for K<15.7 at A_J<1.5, which corresponds to ~5-13 M_Jup for
ages of 1-10 Myr based on theoretical evolutionary models. Our survey has
doubled the number of known members at greater or equal to M9 and has uncovered
the faintest known member in M_K, which should have a mass of ~3-10 M_Jup for
ages of 1-10 Myr. We have used mid-IR photometry from the Spitzer Space
Telescope and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to determine whether the
new members exhibit excess emission that would indicate the presence of
circumstellar disks. The updated disk fraction for Taurus is ~0.7 at less than
or equal to M3.5 and ~0.4 at >M3.5.

Title:A new estimator for gravitational lensing using galaxy and intensity mapping surveys,"
Abstract:  We introduce the Galaxy Intensity Mapping cross-COrrelation estimator
(GIMCO), which is a new tomographic estimator for the gravitational lensing
potential, based on a combination of intensity mapping (IM) and galaxy number
counts. The estimator can be written schematically as
IM$(z_f)\times$galaxy$(z_b)$ $-$ galaxy$(z_f)\times$IM$(z_b)$ for a pair of
distinct redshifts $(z_f,z_b)$; this combination allows to greatly reduce the
contamination by density-density correlations, thus isolating the lensing
signal. As an estimator constructed only from cross-correlations, it is
additionally less susceptible to systematic effects. We show that the new
estimator strongly suppresses cosmic variance and consequently improves the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the detection of lensing, especially on linear
scales and intermediate redshifts. %This makes it particularly valuable for
future studies of dark energy and modified gravity. For cosmic variance
dominated surveys, the SNR of our estimator is a factor 30 larger than the SNR
obtained from the correlation of galaxy number counts only. Shot noise and
interferometer noise reduce the SNR. For the specific example of the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) cross-correlated with the Hydrogen Intensity mapping and
Real time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX), the SNR is around 4, whereas for Euclid
cross-correlated with HIRAX it reaches 52. This corresponds to an improvement
of a factor 4-5 compared to the SNR from DES alone. For Euclid cross-correlated
with HIRAX the improvement with respect to Euclid alone strongly depends on the
redshift. We find that the improvement is particularly important for redshifts
below 1.6, where it reaches a factor of 5. This makes our estimator especially
valuable to test dark energy and modified gravity, that are expected to leave
an impact at low and intermediate redshifts.

Title:Using Random Forest Machine Learning Algorithms in Binary Supernovae Classification,"
Abstract:  In the era of large all-sky surveys, there will be a need for rapid,
automatic classifications of newly discovered transient objects. Our focus here
is the classification of supernovae (SNe). We consider random forest machine
learning algorithm applied to the classification of Type Ia and core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) by full light curves. We also quantitatively show the
potential of early-epoch classification using the same machine learning
techniques. The algorithm uses the shape and magnitude of the light curve peak
to determine the classification. This an initial study to essentially determine
SN type with as few data points as possible. New all-sky surveys will discover
new transients at a rapid rate and decisions will have to be made on very
little data which transients to follow-up. Here we present an initial study
where as few as five data points near peak, we an identify whether it is a Type
Ia or CCSNe with better than 80\% accuracy, but with several biases in the data
that will require addressing in future work.

Title:APOGEE/Kepler Overlap Yields Orbital Solutions for a Variety of Eclipsing Binaries,"
Abstract:  Spectroscopic Eclipsing Binaries (SEBs) are fundamental benchmarks in stellar
astrophysics and today are observed in breathtaking detail by missions like
TESS, Kepler, and APOGEE. We develop a methodology for simultaneous analysis of
high precision Kepler light curves and high resolution near-IR spectra from
APOGEE and present orbital solutions and evolutionary histories for a subset of
SEBs within this overlap. Radial velocities extracted from APOGEE spectra using
the Broadening Function technique are combined with Kepler light curves and to
yield binary orbital solutions. The Broadening Function approach yields more
precise radial velocities than the standard Cross-Correlation Function, which
in turn yields more precise orbital parameters and enables the identification
of tertiary stars. The orbital periods of these seven SEBs range from 4 to 40
days. Four of the systems (KIC 5285607, KIC 6864859, KIC 6778289, and KIC
4285087) are well-detached binaries. The remaining three systems have apparent
tertiary companions, but each exhibits two eclipses along with at least one
spectroscopically varying component (KIC 6449358, KIC 6131659, and KIC
6781535). Gaia distances are available for four targets which we use to
estimate temperatures of both members of these SEBs. We explore evolutionary
histories in H-R diagram space and estimate ages for this subset of our sample.
Finally, we consider the implications for the formation pathways of close
binary systems via interactions with tertiary companions. Our methodology
combined with the era of big data and observation overlap opens up the
possibility of discovering and analyzing large numbers of diverse SEBs,
including those with high flux ratios and those in triple systems.

Title:Pulsating white dwarfs: new insights,"
Abstract:  White dwarf stars constitute the final evolutionary stage for more than 95
per cent of all stars. The Galactic population of white dwarfs conveys a wealth
of information about several fundamental issues and are of vital importance to
study the structure, evolution and chemical enrichment of our Galaxy and its
components ---including the star formation history of the Milky Way. In
addition, white dwarfs are tracers of the evolution of planetary systems along
several phases of stellar evolution. Also, white dwarfs are used as
laboratories for astro-particle physics, being their interest focused on
physics beyond the standard model. The last decade has witnessed a great
progress in the study of white dwarfs. In particular, a wealth of information
of these stars from different surveys has allowed us to make meaningful
comparison of evolutionary models with observations. While some information
like surface chemical composition, temperature and gravity of isolated white
dwarfs can be inferred from spectroscopy, and the total mass and radius can be
derived as well when they are in binaries, the internal structure of these
compact stars can be unveiled only by means of asteroseismology, an approach
based on the comparison between the observed pulsation periods of variable
stars and the periods predicted by appropriate theoretical models. The
asteroseismological techniques allow us to infer details of the internal
chemical stratification, the total mass, and even the stellar rotation profile.
In this review, we first revise the evolutionary channels currently accepted
that lead to the formation of white-dwarf stars, and then, we give a detailed
account of the different sub-types of pulsating white dwarfs known so far,
emphasizing the recent observational and theoretical advancements in the study
of these fascinating variable stars.

Title:The Gemini/HST Galaxy Cluster Project: Environment Effects on the Stellar Populations in the Lynx Clusters at z=1.27,"
Abstract:  Few detailed investigations of stellar populations in passive galaxies beyond
z~1 are based on deep spectroscopic observations, due to the difficulty in
obtaining such data. We present a study of stellar populations, structure, and
mass-to-light ratios of a large sample of bulge-dominated galaxies in the two
z=1.27 clusters Lynx E and Lynx W, based on deep ground-based optical
spectroscopy combined with imaging from Hubble Space Telescope. We find that
Lynx E has a well-defined core of red passive galaxies, while Lynx W lacks such
a core. If all the sample galaxies evolve similarly in size from z=1.27 to the
present, the data allow only 0.1 dex size-growth at a fixed dynamical mass.
However, to link the Lynx central galaxies to brightest cluster galaxies
similar to those of low redshift clusters, the Lynx galaxies would have to grow
by at least a factor five, possibly through major merging. The mass-to-light
ratios and the Balmer absorption lines of the Lynx galaxies are consistent with
passive evolution of the stellar populations from z=1.27 to the present and
support ages of 1--3 Gyr. The galaxies in the outskirts of the clusters contain
younger stellar populations than found in the cluster cores. However, when
evolved passively to z~0 both populations are consistent with the observed
populations in the Coma cluster galaxies. The bulge-dominated emission line
galaxies in the clusters are dominated by stellar populations with sub-solar
metallicities. Thus, additional enrichment of these is required to produce
Coma-like stellar populations by z~0.

"Title:Bow shocks, bow waves, and dust waves. IV. Shell shape statistics","
Abstract:  Stellar bow shocks result from relative motions between stars and their
environment. The interaction of the stellar wind and radiation with gas and
dust in the interstellar medium produces curved arcs of emission at optical,
infrared, and radio wavelengths. We recently proposed a new two-dimensional
classification scheme for the shape of such bow shocks, which we here apply to
three very different observational datasets: mid-infrared arcs around hot OB
stars; far-infrared arcs around luminous cool stars; and H alpha emission-line
arcs around proplyds and other young stars in the Orion Nebula. For OB stars,
the average shape is consistent with simple thin-shell models for the
interaction of a spherical wind with a parallel stream, but the diversity of
observed shapes is many times larger than such models predict. We propose that
this may be caused by time-dependent oscillations in the bow shocks, due to
either instabilities or wind variability. Cool star bow shocks have markedly
more closed wings than hot star bow shocks, which may be due to the dust
emission arising in the shocked stellar wind instead of the shocked
interstellar medium. The Orion Nebula arcs, on the other hand, have both
significantly more open wings and significantly flatter apexes than the hot
star bow shocks. We test several possible explanations for this difference
(divergent ambient stream, low Mach number, observational biases, and influence
of collimated jets), but the evidence for each is inconclusive.

Title:New hot subdwarf stars identified in Gaia DR2 with LAMOST DR5 spectra -- II,"
Abstract:  388 hot subdwarf stars have been identified by using the Hertzsprung-Russell
(HR) diagram built from the second data release (DR2) of the Gaia mission. By
analyzing their observed LAMOST spectra, we characterized 186 sdB, 73 He-sdOB,
65 sdOB, 45 sdO, 12 He-sdO and 7 He-sdB stars. The atmospheric parameters of
these stars (e.g., T eff , log g, log(nHe/nH)) are obtained by fitting the
hydrogen (H) and helium (He) line profiles with synthetic spectra calculated
from non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (non-LTE) model atmospheres. Among
these stars, we have 135 new identified hot subdwarfs which have not been
cataloged before. Although 253 stars appear in the catalog by Geier et al.
(2017) , but only 91 of them have atmospheric parameters. Together with the 294
hot subdwarf stars found by Lei et al. (2018), we identified 682 hot subdwarf
stars in total by using the Gaia HR-diagram and LAMOST spectra. These results
demonstrate the efficiency of our method to combine large surveys to search for
hot subdwarf stars. We found a distinct gap in our He-sdOB stars based on their
He abundance, which is also presented in extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars
of the globular cluster (GC) {\omega} Cen. The number fraction of the sample
size for the two sub-groups is very different between the two counterparts.
However, the distinct gap between the H-sdB stars and He-sdOB stars in {\omega}
Cen is not visible in our sample. More interestingly, the He-sdB population
with the highest He abundance in our sample is completely missing in {\omega}
Cen. The discrepancy between our field hot subdwarf stars and the EHB stas in

machine (HELM) algorithm, we identified 56 hot subdwarf stars in the first data
release (DR1) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope
(LAMOST) survey. The atmospheric parameters of the stars are obtained by
fitting the profiles of hydrogen (H) Balmer lines and helium (He) lines with
synthetic spectra calculated from non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE)
model atmospheres. Five He-rich hot subdwarf stars were found in our sample
with their log(nHe/nH) > -1 , while 51 stars are He-poor sdB, sdO and sdOB
stars. We also confirmed the two He sequences of hot subdwarf stars found by
Edelmann et al. (2003) in Teff - log(nHe/nH) diagram. The HELM algorithm works
directly on the observed spectroscopy and is able to filter out spectral
properties without supplementary photometric data. The results presented in
this study demonstrate that the HELM algorithm is a reliable method to search
for hot subdwarf stars after a suitable training is performed, and it is also
suitable to search for other objects which have obvious features in their
spectra or images.

Title:Northern Galactic Molecular Cloud Clumps in Hi-GAL: Clump and Star Formation within Clouds,"
Abstract:  We investigate how the properties of Galactic giant molecular clouds (GMCs)
and their denser substructures (clumps) correlate with the local star formation
rate. We trace clouds using the $^{12}$CO(3-2) transition, as observed by the
CO High Resolution Survey (COHRS). We identify their constituent clumps using
thermal dust emission, as observed by the Herschel infrared GALactic plane
survey (Hi-GAL). We estimate star formation rates in these clouds using 70
$\mu$m emission. In total, we match 3,674 clumps to 473 clouds in
position-position-velocity space spanning the Galactic longitude range
$10^\circ<\ell<56^\circ$. We find that more massive clouds produce more clumps
and more massive clumps. These clumps have average number densities an order of
magnitude greater than their host clouds. We find a mean clump mass fraction of
$0.20^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$. This mass fraction weakly varies with mass and mass
surface density of clouds, and shows no clear dependence on the virial
parameter and line width of the clouds. The average clump mass fraction is only
weakly dependent upon Galactocentric radius. Although the scatter in our
measured properties is significant, the star formation rate for clouds is
independent of clump mass fraction. However, there is a positive correlation
between the depletion times for clouds and clump mass fraction. We find a star
formation efficiency per free fall time of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}=0.15\%$ for
GMCs but $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}=0.37\%$ for clumps.

resemble those of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. This mock galaxy
contains flattened luminous and dark matter components, resulting in a
logarithmic profile for the global potential. We have tested how well our
Schwarzschild method could constrain the characteristic parameters of the
system for different sample sizes, and also if the functional form of the
potential was unknown. When assuming the true functional form of the potential,
the Schwarzschild modelling technique is able to provide an accurate and
precise measurement of the characteristic mass parameter of the system and
reproduces well the light distribution and the stellar kinematics of our mock
galaxy. When assuming a different functional form for the potential, such as a
flattened NFW profile, we also constrain the mass and scale radius to their
expected values. However in both cases, we find that the flattening parameter
remains largely unconstrained. This is likely because the information content
of the velocity dispersion on the geometric shape of the potential is too
small, since $\sigma$ is constant across our mock dSph. Our results using
Schwarzschild's method indicate that the mass enclosed can be derived reliably,
even if the flattening parameter is unknown, and already for samples containing
2000 line-of-sight radial velocities, such as those currently available.
Further applications of the method to more general distribution functions of
flattened systems are needed to establish how well the flattening of dSph dark
halos can be determined.

Title:Forecast for weighing neutrinos in cosmology with SKA,"
Abstract:  We investigate what role the SKA neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping (IM)
sky survey observation will play in weighing neutrinos in cosmology. We use the
simulated data of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the
HI IM survey based on SKA1 and SKA2 to do the analysis. For the current
observations, we use the Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies observation, the optical BAO measurements, the type Ia supernovae
(SN) observation (Pantheon compilation), and the latest $H_0$ measurement. We
consider three mass ordering cases for massive neutrinos, i.e., the normal
hierarchy (NH), inverted hierarchy (IH), and degenerate hierarchy (DH) cases.
It is found that the SKA observation can significantly improve the constraints
on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $H_0$. Compared to the current observation, the SKA1
data can improve the constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ by about 33%, and on $H_0$
by about 36%; the SKA2 data can improve the constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ by
about 58%, and on $H_0$ by about 66%. It is also found that the SKA observation
can only slightly improve the constraints on $\sum m_\nu$. Compared to the
current observation, the SKA1 data can improve the constraints on $\sum m_\nu$
by about 4%, 3%, and 10%, for the NH, IH, and DH cases, respectively; the SKA2
data can improve the constraints on $\sum m_\nu$ by about 7%, 7%, and 16%, for
the NH, IH, and DH cases, respectively.

Title:The GeV emission in the field of the star-forming region W30 revisited,"
Abstract:  We present a detailed study of the gamma-ray emission from the direction of
the star-forming region W30 based on a decade of the Fermi Large Area Telescope
data in the 0.3-300 GeV photon energy range. The morphological and spectral
analyses allow us to resolve the gamma-ray emission into two extended
structures from different origins. One of them mostly overlaps with the
supernova remnant (SNR) G8.7-0.1 and has a soft spectrum that resembles with
the spectra of other middle-aged SNRs interacting with molecular clouds. The
other shows remarkable spatial and spectral consistency with the TeV emission
from HESS J1804-216, and its spectrum could be naturally explained by inverse
Compton scattering of electrons like a number of TeV gamma-ray emitting pulsar
wind nebulae. Thus we attribute this source to the nebula around the pulsar PSR
J1803-2137.

Title:Unveiling Dust Aggregate Structure in Protoplanetary Disks by Millimeter-wave Scattering Polarization,"
Abstract:  Dust coagulation in a protoplanetary disk is the first step of planetesimal
formation. However, a pathway from dust aggregates to planetesimals remains
unclear. Both numerical simulations and laboratory experiments have suggested
the importance of dust structure in planetesimal formation, but it is not well
constrained by observations. We study how dust structure and porosity alters
polarimetric images at millimeter wavelength by performing 3D radiative
transfer simulations. Aggregates with different porosity and fractal dimension
are considered. As a result, we find that dust aggregates with lower porosity
and/or higher fractal dimension are favorable to explain observed
millimeter-wave scattering polarization of disks. Aggregates with extremely
high porosity fail to explain the observations. In addition, we also show that
particles with moderate porosity show weak wavelength dependence of scattering
polarization, indicating that multi-wavelength polarimetry is useful to
constrain dust porosity. Finally, we discuss implications for dust evolution
and planetesimal formation in disks.

Title:A simple representation of oscillation modes in stars: from mixed modes coupling to glitches,"
Abstract:  Analytical resonance conditions for oscillation modes in stars are very
helpful both to predict and to examine their frequency spectra, as well as to
make the link with their internal properties. In this short paper, we introduce
a general quantization expression for oscillation modes accounting for the
possible existence of a local sharp variation in the equilibrium structure, a
so-called glitch. This representation is based on a direct adaptation of the
progressive-wave picture of mixed modes proposed by Takata (2016b). In this
formulation, a glitch turns out to be characterized by three parameters: its
acoustic depth, the phase lags introduced after the wave reflection at the
considered point, and a coupling factor. Such an expression has two main
advantages. First, it can be easily applicable to a lot of different structural
configurations. Second, it does not assume that the glitch is a small
perturbation. Actually, we check that the obtained expression tends to the
formulations previously derived when the glitch is weak. These research notes
represent a preliminary step towards a more generalized description of
multi-cavity oscillation modes, that was briefly addressed in the poster
presented at the PHOST conference.

Title:hammurabi X: Simulating Galactic Synchrotron Emission with Random Magnetic Fields,"
Abstract:  We present version X of the hammurabi package, the HEALPix-based numeric
simulator for Galactic polarized emission. Improving on its earlier design, we
have fully renewed the framework with modern C++ standards and features.
Multi-threading support has been built in to meet the growing computational
workload in future research. For the first time, we present precision profiles
of hammurabi line-of-sight integral kernel with multi-layer HEALPix shells. In
addition to fundamental improvements, this report focuses on simulating
polarized synchrotron emission with Gaussian random magnetic fields. Two fast
methods are proposed for realizing divergence-free random magnetic fields
either on the Galactic scale where a field alignment and strength modulation
are imposed, or on a local scale where more physically motivated models like a
parameterized magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence can be applied. As an
example application, we discuss the phenomenological implications of Gaussian
random magnetic fields for high Galactic latitude synchrotron foregrounds. In
this, we numerically find B/E polarization mode ratios lower than unity based
on Gaussian realizations of either MHD turbulent spectra or in spatially
aligned magnetic fields.

Title:The Case for a High-Redshift Origin of GRB100205A,"
Abstract:  The number of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) known to have occurred in the
distant Universe (z greater than 5) is small (approx 15), however these events
provide a powerful way of probing star formation at the onset of galaxy
evolution. In this paper, we present the case for GRB100205A being a largely
overlooked high-redshift event. While initially noted as a high-z candidate,
this event and its host galaxy have not been explored in detail. By combining
optical and near-infrared Gemini afterglow imaging (at t less than 1.3 days
since burst) with deep late-time limits on host emission from the Hubble Space
Telescope, we show that the most likely scenario is that GRB100205A arose in
the redshift range 4-8. GRB100205A is an example of a burst whose afterglow,
even at 1 hour post-burst, could only be identified by 8m class IR
observations, and suggests that such observations of all optically dark bursts
may be necessary to significantly enhance the number of high-redshift GRBs
known.

Title:Enhanced X-ray emission from candidate Lyman continuum emitting galaxies,"
Abstract:  X-ray binaries may have helped reionize the early Universe by enabling Lyman
continuum escape. We analyzed a set of 8 local galaxies that are potential
Lyman leaking galaxies, identified by a blue color and weak emission lines,
using Chandra X-ray observations. Five of the galaxies feature X-ray sources,
while three galaxies are not significantly detected in X-rays. X-ray
luminosities were found for the galaxies and X-ray sources. Four of the
galaxies have elevated X-ray luminosity versus what would be expected based on
star formation rate and metallicity. The presence of detected X-ray sources
within the galaxies is found to correlate with the ratio of the star formation
rate estimated from the near-ultraviolet flux to that estimated from the
infrared. This implies reduced obscuration due to dust in the galaxies with
X-ray sources. These results support the idea that X-ray binaries may be an
important part of the process of reionziation.

We complement these observations with new Australia Telescope Compact Array

data published in earlier papers from our collaboration. Adding the co-eval
GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison widefield array (GLEAM) survey

frequency range, with no sign of dust emission from the host galaxy at mm
wavelengths nor of a sharp high frequency decline due, for example, to electron
ageing. We do however find indications of multiple emitting components and

different source classes. Source counts in polarization are presented at

Title:Calibration of the virial factor $f$ in supermassive black hole masses of reverberation-mapped AGNs,"
Abstract:  Using a compiled sample of 34 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with
measured H$\beta$ time lags from the reverberation mapping (RM) method and
measured bulge stellar velocity dispersions $\sigma_*$, we calculate the virial
factor $f$ by assuming that the RM AGNs intrinsically obey the same $M_{\rm
BH}-\sigma_*$ relation as quiescent galaxies, where $M_{\rm BH}$ is the mass of
the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Considering four tracers of the velocity of
the broad-line regions (BLRs), i.e., the H$\beta$ line width or line dispersion
from the mean or rms spectrum, there are four kinds of the factor $f$. Using
the \hb Full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) to trace the BLRs velocity, we find
significant correlations between the factor $f$ and some observational
parameters, e.g., FWHM, the line dispersion. Using the line dispersion to trace
the BLRs velocity, these relations disappear or become weaker. It implies the
effect of inclination in BLRs geometry. It also suggests that the variable $f$
in $M_{\rm BH}$ estimated from luminosity and FWHM in a single-epoch spectrum
is not negligible. Using a simple model of thick-disk BLRs, we also find that,
as the tracer of the BLRs velocity, H$\beta$ FWHM has some dependence on the
inclination, while the line dispersion $\sigma_{\rm H\beta }$ is insensitive to
the inclination. Considering the calibrated FWHM-based factor $f$ from the mean
spectrum, the scatter of the SMBH mass is 0.39 dex for our sample of 34 low
redshift RM AGNs. For a high redshift sample of 30 SDSS RM AGNs with measured
stellar velocity dispersions, we find that the SMBH mass scatter is larger than
that for our sample of 34 low redshift RM AGNs. It implies the possibility of
evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relation from high-redshift to
low-redshift AGNs.

Title:Can we constrain the dark energy equation of state parameters using configuration entropy?,"
Abstract:  We propose a new scheme for constraining the dark energy equation of state
parameter/parameters based on the study of the evolution of the configuration
entropy. We analyze a set of one parameter and two parameter dynamical dark
energy models and find that the derivative of the configuration entropy in all
the dynamical dark energy models exhibit a minimum. The magnitude of the
minimum of the entropy rate is decided by both the parametrization of the
equation of state as well as the associated parameters. The location of the
minimum of the entropy rate is less sensitive to the form of the
parametrization but depends on the associated parameters. We determine the best
fit equations for the location and magnitude of the minimum of the entropy rate
in terms of the parameter/parameters of the dark energy equation of state.
These relations would allow us to constrain the dark energy equation of state
parameter/parameters for any given parametrization provided the evolution of
the configuration entropy in the Universe is known from observations.

Title:Selfgravitating disks in binary systems: an SPH approach -- I. Implementation of the code and reliability tests,"
Abstract:  The study of the stability of massive gaseous disks around a star in a
non-isolated context is not a trivial issue and becomes a more complicated task
for disks hosted by binary systems. The role of self-gravity is thought to be
significant, whenever the ratio of the disk to the star mass is non-negligible.
To tackle these issues we implemented, tested and applied our own Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm. The code (named GaSPH) passed various
quality tests and shows good performances, so to be reliably applied to the
study of disks around stars accounting for self-gravity. This work aims to
introduce and describe the algorithm, making some performance and stability

Title:Probing the effect of cadence on the estimates of photospheric energy and helicity injections in eruptive active region NOAA AR 11158,"
Abstract:  In this work we study how the input data cadence affects the photospheric
energy and helicity injection estimates in eruptive NOAA active region 11158.
We sample the novel 2.25-minute vector magnetogram and Dopplergram data from
the \emph{Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (HMI) instrument onboard the
\emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) spacecraft to create input datasets of
variable cadences ranging from 2.25 minutes to 24 hours. We employ
state-of-the-art data processing, velocity and electric field inversion methods
for deriving estimates of the energy and helicity injections from these
datasets. We find that the electric field inversion methods that reproduce the
observed magnetic field evolution through the use of Faraday's law are more
stable against variable cadence: the PDFI (PTD-Doppler-FLCT-Ideal) electric
field inversion method produces consistent injection estimates for cadences
from 2.25 minutes up to 2 hours, implying that the photospheric processes
acting on time scales below 2 hours contribute little to the injections, or
that they are below the sensitivity of the input data and the PDFI method. On
other hand, the electric field estimate derived from the output of DAVE4VM
(Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms), which does
not fulfil Faraday's law exactly, produces significant variations in the energy
and helicity injection estimates in the 2.25-minute to 2-hour cadence range. We
present also a third, novel DAVE4VM-based electric field estimate, which
corrects the poor inductivity of the raw DAVE4VM estimate. This method is less
sensitive to the changes of cadence, but still faces significant issues for the
lowest of considered cadences ($\geq$2 hours). We find several potential
problems in both PDFI- and DAVE4VM-based injection estimates and conclude that
the quality of both should be surveyed further in controlled environments.

2}$O $3_{\rm 2,1}-3_{\rm 1,2}$ lines as well as a weak radio continuum. The
strong [CII] line yields a systemic redshift of the host galaxy to be
z=6.5188$\pm$0.0001. The magnification makes J0439+1634 the far-infrared (FIR)
brightest quasar at z > 6 known, with the brightest [CII] line yet detected at
this redshift. The FIR luminosity is (3.4$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{13}$ $\mu^{-1}$
$L_{\odot}$, where $\mu$ $\sim$ 2.6 - 6.6 is the magnification of the host
galaxy, estimated based on the lensing configuration from HST imaging. We
estimate the dust mass to be (2.2$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{9}$ $\mu^{-1}$
$M_{\odot}$. The CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution using four CO lines is
best fit by a two-component model of the molecular gas excitation. The
estimates of molecular gas mass derived from CO lines and atomic carbon mass
are consistent, in the range of 3.9 - 8.9 $\times$10$^{10} \mu^{-1}$
$M_{\odot}$. The [CII]/[CI], [CII]/CO, and [OI]/[CII] line luminosity ratios
suggest a photodissociation region model with more than one component. The
ratio of H$_{\rm 2}$O $3_{\rm 2,1}-3_{\rm 1,2}$ line luminosity to $L_{\rm

ultra-/hyper-luminous infrared galaxies. The VLA observations reveal an

Point Observatory ($R\approx$31,500). We measured spectroscopic effective
temperatures, surface gravities and metallicities for most stars in the sample
with SME and MOOG. Our stellar property results are consistent with the
photometric effective temperatures from the Gaia DR2 pipeline. We also measured
their chromospheric $S$ and $\log R^\prime_\mathrm{HK}$ indices to classify the
stars as active or inactive and study the connection between chromospheric
activity and starspots. We then attempted to infer the starspot covering
fractions on the active stars by modeling their spectra as a linear combination
of hot and cool inactive stellar spectral templates. We find that it is
critical to use precise colors of the stars to place stringent priors on the
plausible spot covering fractions. The inferred spot covering fractions
generally increase with the chromospheric activity indicator $\log
R^\prime_\mathrm{HK}$, though we are largely insensitive to spot coverages
smaller than $f_S \lesssim 20$%. We find a dearth of stars with small $\log

Title:Faint solar analogs: at the limit of no reddening,"
Abstract:  The flux distribution of solar analogs is required for calculating the
spectral albedo of Solar System bodies such as asteroids and trans-Neptunian
objects. Ideally a solar analog should be comparably faint as the target of
interest, but only few analogs fainter than V = 9 were identified so far. Only
atmospheric parameters equal to solar guarantee a flux distribution equal to
solar as well, while only photometric colors equal to solar do not. Reddening
is also a factor to consider when selecting faint analog candidates. We
implement the methodology for identifying faint analogs at the limit of
precision allowed by current spectroscopic surveys. We quantify the precision
attainable for the atmospheric parameters effective temperature ($T_{eff}$),
metallicity ([Fe/H]), surface gravity (log $g$) when derived from moderate low
resolution (R=8000) spectra with S/N $\sim 100$. We calibrated $T_{eff}$ and
[Fe/H] as functions of equivalent widths of spectral indices by means of the
PCA regression. We derive log $g$, mass, radius, and age from the atmospheric
parameters, Gaia parallaxes and evolutionary tracks. We obtained
$T_{eff}$/[Fe/H]/log $g$ with precision of 97 K/0.06 dex/0.05 dex. We identify
five solar analogs with $V\sim10.5$ (located at $\sim135$ pc): HIP 991, HIP
5811, HIP 69477, HIP 55619 and HIP 61835. Other six stars have $T_{eff}$ close
to solar but slightly lower [Fe/H]. Our analogs show no evidence of reddening
but for four stars, which present $E(B-V) \geq 0.06$ mag, translating to at
least a 200 K decrease in photometric $T_{eff}$.

Title:A Sub-Neptune Exoplanet with a Low-Metallicity Methane-Depleted Atmosphere and Mie-Scattering Clouds,"
Abstract:  With no analogues in the Solar System, the discovery of thousands of
exoplanets with masses and radii intermediate between Earth and Neptune was one
of the big surprises of exoplanet science. These super-Earths and sub-Neptunes
likely represent the most common outcome of planet formation. Mass and radius
measurements indicate a diversity in bulk composition much wider than for gas
giants; however, direct spectroscopic detections of molecular absorption and
constraints on the gas mixing ratios have largely remained limited to planets
more massive than Neptune. Here, we analyze a combined Hubble/Spitzer Space
Telescope dataset of 12 transits and 20 eclipses of the sub-Neptune GJ 3470 b,
whose mass of 12.6 $M_\oplus$ places it near the half-way point between
previously studied exo-Neptunes (22-23 $M_\oplus$) and exoplanets known to have
rocky densities (7 $M_\oplus$). Obtained over many years, our data set provides
a robust detection of water absorption (>5$\sigma$) and a thermal emission
detection from the lowest irradiated planet to date. We reveal a
low-metallicity, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere similar to a gas giant, but
strongly depleted in methane gas. The low, near-solar metallicity (O/H=0.2-18)
sets important constraints on the potential planet formation processes at low
masses as well as the subsequent accretion of solids. The low methane abundance
indicates that methane is destroyed much more efficiently than previously
predicted, suggesting that the CH$_4$/CO transition curve has to be revisited
for close-in planets. Finally, we also find a sharp drop in the cloud opacity
at 2-3 $\mu$m characteristic of Mie scattering, which enables narrow
constraints on the cloud particle size and makes GJ 3470b a keystone target for
mid-IR characterization with JWST.

at z = 0.1108 and a foreground northern substructure at z = 0.1082. The
analysis reveals an X-ray surface brightness edge at r \simeq 60 kpc from the
cluster core. The thermodynamical profiles across the edge are ruling out the
shock scenario. The temperature jump (from \sim 6 keV to \sim 10 keV), and
pressure equilibrium (P0/P1 = 1.01 \pm 0.23) across the edge, are consistent
with the definition of a cold front with a Mach number M=0.94^{+0.13}_{-0.17}
also observed a weak bow-shock at \sim 100 kpc in front of the cold cloud,
corresponding an upper limit to the Mach number M \sim 1.1. If the northern

bol}$/$M_{\rm fwhm}$ ratios of between 10$^{0.6}$ and 10$^{2.2}$) and have well
defined turning on and termination points. We estimate the lower limit for the
mass of embedded objects to be $\geq$ 6 M$_{\odot}$ and the statistical
lifetime of the methanol maser stage to be $\sim$ 3.3$\times$10$^{4}$ yrs. This
suggests that methanol masers are indeed reliable tracers of high mass star
formation, and indicates that the evolutionary period traced by this marker is
relatively rapid.

Title:Model Comparison of Dark Energy models Using Deep Network,"
Abstract:  This work uses a combination of a variational auto-encoder and generative
adversarial network to compare different dark energy models in light of
observations, e.g., the distance modulus from type Ia supernovae. The network
finds an analytical variational approximation to the true posterior of the
latent parameters in the models, yielding consistent model comparison results
with those derived by the standard Bayesian method, which suffers from a
computationally expensive integral over the parameters in the product of the
likelihood and the prior. The parallel computational nature of the network
together with the stochastic gradient descent optimization technique leads to
an efficient way to compare the physical models given a set of observations.
The converged network also provides interpolation for a dataset, which is
useful for data reconstruction.

Title:New constraints on the dust and gas distribution in the LkCa 15 disk from ALMA,"
Abstract:  We search a large parameter space of the LkCa 15's disk density profile to
fit its observed radial intensity profile of $^{12}$CO (J = 3-2) obtained from
ALMA. The best-fit model within the parameter space has a disk mass of 0.1
$M_{\odot}$ (using an abundance ratio of $^{12}$CO/H$_2$ $=$ 1.4 $\times
10^{-4}$ in mass), an inner cavity of 45 AU in radius, an outer edge at $\sim$
600 AU, and a disk surface density profile follows a power-law of the form
$\rho_r \propto r^{-4}$. For the disk density profiles that can lead to a small
reduced $\chi^2$ of goodness-of-fit, we find that there is a clear linear
correlation between the disk mass and the power-law index $\gamma$ in the
equation of disk density profile. This suggests that the $^{12}$CO disk of LkCa
15 is optically thick and we can fit its $^{12}$CO radial intensity profile
using either a lower disk mass with a smaller $\gamma$ or a higher disk mass
with a bigger $\gamma$. By comparing the $^{12}$CO channel maps of the best-fit
model with disk models with higher or lower masses, we find that a disk mass of
$\sim$ 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ can best reproduce the observed morphology of the
$^{12}$CO channel maps. The dust continuum map at 0.87 mm of the LkCa 15 disk
shows an inner cavity of the similar size of the best-fit gas model, but its
out edge is at $\sim$ 200 AU, much smaller than the fitted gas disk. Such a
discrepancy between the outer edges of the gas and dust disks is consistent
with dust drifting and trapping models.

Title:A Classifier to Detect Elusive Astronomical Objects through Photometry,"
Abstract:  The application of machine learning principles in the photometric search of
elusive astronomical objects has been a less-explored frontier of research.
Here we have used three methods: the Neural Network and two variants of
k-Nearest Neighbour, to identify brown dwarf candidates using the photometric
colours of known brown dwarfs. We initially check the efficiencies of these
three classification techniques, both individually and collectively, on known
objects. This is followed by their application to three regions in the sky,
namely Hercules (2 deg x 2 deg), Serpens (9 deg x 4 deg) and Lyra (2 deg x 2
deg). Testing these algorithms on sets of objects that include known brown
dwarfs shows a high level of completeness. This includes the Hercules and
Serpens regions where brown dwarfs have been detected. We use these methods to
search and identify brown dwarf candidates towards the Lyra region. We infer
that the collective method of classification, also known as ensemble
classifier, is highly efficient in the identification of brown dwarf
candidates.

Title:Limits on the Weak Equivalence Principle and Photon Mass with FRB 121102 Sub-pulses,"
Abstract:  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short duration ($\sim$millisecond) radio
transients with cosmological origin. The simple sharp features of the FRB
signal have been utilized to probe two fundamental laws of physics, namey,
testing Einstein's weak equivalence principle and constraining the rest mass of
the photon. Recently, \cite{hessels18} found that after correcting for
dispersive delay, some of the bursts in FRB 121102 have complex time-frequency
structures that include sub-pulses with a time-frequency downward drifting
property. Using the delay time between sub-pulses in FRB 121102, here we show
that the parameterized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ is the same for
photons with different energies to the level of
$\left|\gamma_1-\gamma_2\right|<2.5\times 10^{-16}$, which is 1000 times better
than previous constraints from FRBs using similar methods. We also obtain a
stringent constraint on the photon mass, $m_{\gamma} < 5.1\times10^{-48}$ g,
which is 10 times smaller than previous best limits on the photon mass derived
through the velocity dispersion method.

Abstract:  The Transient High-Energy Sky and Early Universe Surveyor (THESEUS) is a
mission concept developed in the last years by a large European consortium and
currently under study by the European Space Agency (ESA) as one of the three

high-redshift GRBs for getting unique clues to the early Universe and, being an

under-luminous, ultra-long) and many other classes of transient sources and
phenomena, at providing a substantial contribution to multi-messenger
time-domain astrophysics. Under these respects, THESEUS will show a strong
synergy with the large observing facilities of the future, like E-ELT, TMT,
SKA, CTA, ATHENA, in the electromagnetic domain, as well as with
next-generation gravitational-waves and neutrino detectors, thus greatly
enhancing their scientific return.

Title:Looking deep into the Rosette Nebula's heart: the (sub)stellar content of the massive young cluster NGC 2244,"
Abstract:  As part of the ongoing effort to characterize the low-mass (sub)stellar
population in a sample of massive young clusters, we have targeted the ~2 Myr
old cluster NGC 2244. The distance to NGC 2244 from Gaia DR2 parallaxes is 1.59
kpc, with errors of 1% (statistical) and 11% (systematic). We used the
Flamingos-2 near-infrared camera at the Gemini-South telescope for deep
multi-band imaging of the central portion of the cluster (~2.4pc^2). We
determined membership in a statistical manner, through a comparison of the
cluster's color-magnitude diagram to that of a control field. Masses and
extinctions of the candidate members are then calculated with the help of
evolutionary models, leading to the first initial mass function (IMF) of the
cluster extending into the substellar regime, with the 90\% completeness limit
around 0.02 Msun. The IMF is well represented by a broken power law (dN/dM
\propto M^{-alpha}), with a break at ~0.4 Msun. The slope on the high mass side
(0.4 - 7 Msun) is alpha=2.12+-0.08, close to the standard Salpeter slope. In
the low-mass range (0.02 - 0.4 Msun), we find a slope alpha=1.03+-0.02, which
is at the high end of the typical values obtained in nearby star-forming
regions (alpha=0.5-1.0), but still in agreement within the uncertainties. Our
results reveal no clear evidence for variations in the formation efficiency of
brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars due to the presence of OB stars, or for a
change in stellar densities. Our finding rules out photoevaporation and
fragmentation of infalling filaments as substantial pathways for brown dwarf
formation.

Title:ASASSN-18fk: A new WZ Sge-type dwarf nova with multiple rebrightenings and a new candidate for a superhumping intermediate polar,"
Abstract:  We present the result of a multi-longitude campaign on the photometric study
of the dwarf nova ASASSN-18fk during its superoutburst in 2018. It was observed
with 18 telescopes at 15 sites during ~70 nights within a three-month interval.
Observations covered the main outburst, six rebrightenings and 50-d decline to
a near-quiescent state. We identify ASASSN-18fk as WZ Sge-type dwarf nova with
multiple rebrightenings and show the evolution of the 0.06-d superhump period
over all stages of the superoutburst. A strong 22-min brightness modulation
that superimposed on superhumps is found during rebrightenings and decline.
Some evidence of this modulation in a form of a sideband signal is detected
during the very onset of the outburst. We interpret the 22-min modulation as a
spin period of the white dwarf and suggest that ASASSN-18fk is a good candidate
for a superhumping intermediate polar.

from transients is key for understanding the encoded physics. At the same time,
current generation networks of fully-robotic telescopes provide new
opportunities in terms of fast followup and sky coverage. This work describes
our pipeline designed for robotic optical followup of gamma-ray bursts with the
Las Cumbres Observatory network. We designed a Python code to promptly submit
observation requests to the Las Cumbres Observatory network within 3 minutes of
the receipt of the socket notice. Via Telegram the pipeline keeps the users
informed, allowing them to take control upon request. Our group was able to
track the early phases of the evolution of the optical output from gamma-ray
bursts with a fully-robotic procedure and here we report the case of GRB180720B
as an example. The developed pipeline represent a key ingredient for any

successfully utilized and adapted for LCO, it can also be adapted to any other

Title:Concept of an Experimental Ultra Long-wavelength Radio Array,"
Abstract:  The Ultra-Long Wavelength (ULW) regime of longer than 10 m (corresponding to
frequencies below 30 MHz), remains as the last virtually unexplored window in
radio astronomy, and is presently attracting considerable attention as an area
of potentially rewarding studies. However, the opaqueness of the Earth's
ionosphere makes the ULW celestial radio emission very difficult to detect with
ground-based instrumentation. The impact of the ionosphere on ULW radio
emission depends on the Solar cycle activities and varies with time. In
addition, the ULW spectrum region is densely populated by intensive artificial
radio frequency interference (RFI). An obvious solution of these problems is to
place an ULW radio telescope in space. However, this solution is expensive and
poses non-negligible technological challenges. An alternative approach is
triggered by recent studies showing that the period of post 2020 will be most
suitable for exploratory ground-based ULW radio observations due to the
expected 'calm' state of the ionosphere; the ionospheric cutoff-frequency could
be well below 10 MHz, even in the day time. In anticipation of this upcoming
opportunity, we propose and present in this paper a concept of an experimental
ULW radio array, with the intention of setting it up in Inner Mongolia, China.
This ULW facility will use the infrastructure of the currently operational
Miangtu Spectra Radio Heliograph (MUSER). The proposed ULW array covers the
frequency range from 1 to 72 MHz. This experimental array will be used for
exploratory studies of celestial radio emission in the ULW range of the
spectrum.

Title:On the photometric signature of fast rotators,"
Abstract:  Rapidly rotating stars have been recently recognized as having a major role
in the interpretation of colour-magnitude diagrams of young and
intermediate-age star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds and in the Milky Way.
In this work, we evaluate the distinctive spectra and distributions in
colour-colour space that follow from the presence of a substantial range in
effective temperatures across the surface of fast rotators. The calculations
are inserted in a formalism similar to the one usually adopted for non-rotating
stars, which allows us to derive tables of bolometric corrections as a function
not only of a reference effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity,
but also of the rotational speed with respect to the break-up value, $\omega$,
and the inclination angle, $i$. We find that only very fast rotators
($\omega>0.95$) observed nearly equator-on ($i>45^\circ$) present sizable
deviations from the colour-colour relations of non-rotating stars. In light of
these results, we discuss the photometry of the $\sim$ 200-Myr-old cluster NGC
1866 and its split main sequence, which has been attributed to the simultaneous
presence of slow and fast rotators. The small dispersion of its stars in
colour-colour diagrams allow us to conclude that fast rotators in this cluster
either have rotational velocities $\omega<0.95$, or are all observed nearly
pole-on. Such geometric colour-colour effects, although small, might be
potentially detectable in the huge, high-quality photometric samples in the
post-Gaia era, in addition to the evolutionary effects caused by
rotation-induced mixing.

Title:The molecular outflow in NGC253 at a resolution of two parsecs,"
Abstract:  We present 0.15'' (~2.5pc) resolution ALMA CO(3-2) observations of the
starbursting center in NGC253. Together with archival ALMA CO(1-0) and CO(2-1)
data we decompose the emission into a disk and non-disk component. We find
~7-16% of the CO luminosity to be associated with the non-disk component
($1.2-4.2 \times 10^7$ K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$). The total molecular gas mass in
the center of NGC253 is $\sim 3.6 \times 10^8$ M$_\odot$ with $\sim 0.5 \times
10^8$ M$_\odot$ (~15%) in the non-disk component. These measurements are
consistent across independent mass estimates through three CO transitions. The
high-resolution CO(3-2) observations allow us to identify the molecular outflow
within the non-disk gas. Using a starburst conversion factor, we estimate the
deprojected molecular mass outflow rate, kinetic energy and momentum in the
starburst of NGC253. The deprojected molecular mass outflow rate is in the
range ~14-39 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with an uncertainty of 0.4dex. The large
spread arises due to different interpretations of the kinematics of the
observed gas while the errors are due to unknown geometry. The majority of this
outflow rate is contributed by distinct outflows perpendicular to the disk,
with a significant contribution by diffuse molecular gas. This results in a
mass loading factor $\eta = \dot{M}_\mathrm{out} / \dot{M}_\mathrm{SFR}$ in the
range $\eta \sim 8-20$ for gas ejected out to ~300pc. We find the kinetic
energy of the outflow to be $\sim 2.5-4.5 \times 10^{54}$ erg and ~0.8dex
typical error which is ~0.1% of the total or ~8% of the kinetic energy supplied
by the starburst. The outflow momentum is $4.8-8.7 \times 10^8$ M$_\odot$ km
s$^{-1}$ (~0.5dex error) or ~2.5-4% of the kinetic momentum released into the
ISM by feedback. The unknown outflow geometry and launching sites are the
primary source of uncertainty in this study.

"Title:Intrinsic alignment statistics of density and velocity fields at large scales: Formulation, modeling, and baryon acoustic oscillation features","
Abstract:  The kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect enables us to directly probe the
density-weighted velocity field up to very large cosmic scales. We investigate
the effects of intrinsic alignments (IAs) of dark-matter halo shapes on cosmic
density and velocity fields on such large scales. In the literature IAs have
been detected up to $\sim 100~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ using the gravitational
shear-intrinsic ellipticity correlation and the alignment correlation function.
In this paper we introduce the corresponding various velocity statistics: the
(density-weighted) velocity-intrinsic ellipticity correlation as well as the
alignment pairwise infall momentum, momentum correlation function, and
density-weighted pairwise velocity dispersion. We derive theoretical
expressions for these velocity alignment statistics for the first time based on
the assumption that the density fluctuation is a Gaussian random field. Using
large-volume, high-resolution $N$-body simulations, we measure the alignment
statistics of density and velocity fields. The behaviors of IAs in the velocity
statistics are similar to those in the density statistics, except that the halo
orientations are aligned with the velocity field up to scales larger than those
with the density field, $r\gg 100~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, because of a factor of the
wave number in the linear relation between the density and velocity fields in
Fourier space, $v\propto \delta/k$. We show that the detected IAs of the
velocity field can be well predicted by the linear alignment model. We also
demonstrate that the baryon acoustic oscillation features can be detected in
both the conventional and alignment velocity statistics. Our results indicate
that observations of IAs with the velocity field on large scales can provide
additional information on cosmological models, complementary to those with the
density field.

data from SKA1-MID and HIRAX, combined with LSST photometric galaxy samples. We
find that, thanks to their different resolutions, SKA1-MID and HIRAX are highly
complementary in such an analysis. We predict that SKA1-MID can achieve a
detection with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 15$ on a multipole range of
$\ell \lesssim 200$, while HIRAX can reach a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 50$

magnification signal will be possible on a wide redshift range with foreground
HI intensity maps up to $z \lesssim 2$, while optimal results are obtained when
$0.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.3$. Finally, we perform a signal to noise analysis
that shows how these measurements can constrain the HI parameters across a wide
redshift range.

Abstract:  Apart from the few tens of stellar-mass black holes discovered in binary

lurking in our Galaxy. Although some IBHs are able to accrete matter from the
interstellar medium, the accretion flow is usually weak and thus radiatively
inefficient, which results in significant material outflow. We study electron
acceleration generated by the shock formed between this outflow and the
surrounding material, and the subsequent radio synchrotron emission from
accelerated electrons. By numerically calculating orbits of IBHs to obtain
their spatial and velocity distributions, we estimate the number of IBHs
detectable by surveys using SKA1-mid (SKA2) as $\sim 30$ ($\sim 700$) for the
most optimistic case. The SKA's parallax measurements may accurately give their
distances, possibly shedding light on the properties of the black holes in our

Title:Thermal history modeling of the L chondrite parent body,"
Abstract:  The radius of the L chondrite parent body, its formation time, and its
evolution history are determined by fitting theoretical models to empirical
data of radioisotopic chronometers for L chondrites. A simplified evolution
model for the L chondrite parent body is constructed considering sintering of
the initially porous material, temperature dependent heat conductivity, and an
insulating regolith layer. Such models are fitted to thermochronological data
of five meteorites for which precise data for the Hf-W and U-Pb-Pb
thermochronometers have been published. A set of parameters for the L chondrite
parent body is found that yields excellent agreement (within error bounds)
between a thermal evolution model and thermochonological data. Empirical
cooling rate data also agree with the model results within error bounds such
that there is no conflict between cooling rate data and the onion-shell model.
Two models are found to be compatible with the presently available empirical
data: One model with a radius of 115 km and a formation time of 1.89 Ma after
CAI formation, another model with 160 km radius and formation time of 1.835 Ma.
The central temperature of the smaller body remains well below the Ni,Fe-FeS
eutectic melting temperature and is consistent with the apparent non-existence
of primitive achondrites related to the L chondrites. For the bigger model
incipient melting in the central core region is predicted which opens the
possibility that primitive achondrites related to L chondrites could be found.

(0.96 - 1.71 $\mu$m). With its aim to search for habitable planets around M
dwarfs, several planets of different masses have been detected. The
characterization of the target sample is important for the ability to derive
and constrain the physical properties of any planetary systems that are
detected. As a continuation of previous work in this context, we derived the
fundamental stellar parameters effective temperature, surface gravity, and
metallicity of the CARMENES M-dwarf targets from PHOENIX model fits using a
$\chi^2$ method. We calculated updated PHOENIX stellar atmosphere models that
include a new equation of state to especially account for spectral features of
low-temperature stellar atmospheres as well as new atomic and molecular line
lists. We show the importance of selecting magnetically insensitive lines for
fitting to avoid effects of stellar activity in the line profiles. For the
first time, we directly compare stellar parameters derived from multiwavelength
range spectra, simultaneously observed for the same star. In comparison with
literature values we show that fundamental parameters derived from visible
spectra and visible and near-infrared spectra combined are in better agreement

Title:The r-process nucleosynthesis in the outflows from short GRB accretion disks,"
Abstract:  Short gamma-ray bursts require a rotating black hole, surrounded by a
magnetized relativistic accretion disk, such as the one formed by coalescing
binary neutron stars or neutron star - black hole systems. The accretion onto a
Kerr black hole is the mechanism of launching a baryon-free relativistic jet.
An additional uncollimated outflow, consisting of sub-relativistic neutron-rich
material which becomes unbound by thermal, magnetic and viscous forces, is
responsible for blue and red kilonova. We explore the formation, composition
and geometry of the secondary outflow by means of simulating accretion disks
with relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics and employing realistic nuclear
equation of state. We calculate the nucleosynthetic r-process yields by
sampling the outflow with a dense set of tracer particles. Nuclear heating from
the residual r-process radioactivities in the freshly synthesized nuclei is
expected to power a red kilonova, contributing independently from the dynamical
ejecta component, launched at the time of merger, and neutron-poor broad polar
outflow, launched from the surface of the hypermassive neutron star by neutrino
wind. Our simulations show that both magnetisation of the disk and high black
hole spin are able to launch fast wind outflows ($v/c\sim 0.11-0.23$) with a
broad range of electron fraction $Y_{\rm e}\sim 0.1-0.4$, and help explain the
multiple components observed in the kilonova lightcurves. The total mass loss
from the post-merger disk via unbound outflows is between 2\% and 17\% of the
initial disk mass.

Title:Runaway climate cooling of ocean planets in the habitable zone: a consequence of seafloor weathering enhanced by melting of high-pressure ice,"
Abstract:  Terrestrial planets covered globally with thick oceans (termed ocean planets)
in the habitable zone were previously inferred to have extremely hot climates
in most cases. This is because ${\rm H_2O}$ high-pressure (HP) ice on the
seafloor prevents chemical weathering and, thus, removal of atmospheric CO$_2$.
Previous studies, however, ignored melting of the HP ice and horizontal
variation in heat flux from oceanic crusts. Here we examine whether high heat
fluxes near the mid-ocean ridge melts the HP ice and thereby removes
atmospheric ${\rm CO_2}$. We develop integrated climate models of an Earth-size
ocean planet with plate tectonics for different ocean masses, which include the
effects of HP ice melting, seafloor weathering, and the carbonate-silicate
geochemical carbon cycle. We find that the heat flux near the mid-ocean ridge
is high enough to melt the ice, enabling seafloor weathering. In contrast to
the previous theoretical prediction, we show that climates of terrestrial
planets with massive oceans lapse into extremely cold ones (or snowball states)
with CO$_2$-poor atmospheres. Such extremely cold climates are achieved mainly
because the HP ice melting fixes seafloor temperature at the melting
temperature, thereby keeping a high weathering flux regardless of surface
temperature. We estimate that ocean planets with oceans several tens of the
Earth's ocean mass no longer maintain temperate climates. These results suggest
that terrestrial planets with extremely cold climates exist even in the
habitable zone beyond the solar system, given the frequency of water-rich
planets predicted by planet formation theories.

Title:Evidence for Asymmetry in the Velocity Distribution of the Interstellar Neutral Helium Flow Observed by IBEX and Ulysses,"
Abstract:  We use observations from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and
Ulysses to explore the possibility that the interstellar neutral helium flowing
through the inner solar system possesses an intrinsic non-Maxwellian velocity
distribution. In fitting the IBEX and Ulysses data, we experiment with both a
kappa distribution and a bi-Maxwellian, instead of the usual Maxwellian
assumption. The kappa distribution does not improve the quality of fit to
either the IBEX or Ulysses data, and we find lower limits to the kappa
parameter of kappa>12.1 and kappa>6.0 from the IBEX and Ulysses analyses,
respectively. In contrast, we do find evidence that a bi-Maxwellian improves
fit quality. For IBEX, there is a clear preferred bi-Maxwellian solution with
T_perp/T_par=0.62+/-0.11 oriented about an axis direction with ecliptic
coordinates (lambda_axis,b_axis)=(57.2+/-8.9 deg,-1.6+/-5.9 deg). The Ulysses
data provide support for this result, albeit with lower statistical
significance. The axis direction is close to the ISM flow direction, in a
heliocentric rest frame, and is therefore unlikely to be indicative of velocity
distribution asymmetries intrinsic to the ISM. It is far more likely that these
results indicate the presence of asymmetries induced by interactions in the
outer heliosphere.

Title:A comparison of the R_h=ct and LCDM cosmologies based on the observed halo mass function,"
Abstract:  The growth of structure probes the re-ionization history and quasar abundance
in the Universe, constituting an important probe of the cosmological
predictions. Halos are not directly observable, however, so their mass and
evolution must be inferred indirectly. Studies based on the assumption of a
constant halo to stellar mass ratio M_h/M_* (extrapolated from z<4) reveal
significant tension with LCDM---a failure known as ""The Impossibly Early Galaxy
Problem"". But whether this ratio evolves or remains constant through redshift
4<z<10 is still being debated. To eliminate the tension with LCDM, it would
have to change by about 0.8 dex over this range, an issue that may be settled
by upcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. In this paper, we
study this problem in the context of another
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model known as the R_h=ct universe,
and use our previous measurement of sigma_8 from the cosmological growth rate,
together with new solutions to the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, to interpret
these recent halo measurements. We demonstrate that the predicted mass and
redshift dependence of the halo distribution in R_h=ct is consistent with the
data, even assuming a constant M_h/M_* throughout the observed redshift range
(4<z<10), contrasting sharply with the tension in LCDM. We conclude that---if
M_h/M_* turns out to be constant---the massive galaxies and their halos must
have formed earlier than is possible in LCDM.

Title:Pairwise Tidal Equilibrium States and the Architecture of Extrasolar Planetary Systems,"
Abstract:  Current observations indicate that the planet formation process often
produces multiple planet systems with nearly circular orbits, regular spacing,
a narrow range of inclination angles, and similar planetary masses of order
$m_{\rm p}\sim10M_\oplus$. Motivated by the observational sample, this paper
determines the tidal equilibrium states for this class of extrasolar planetary
systems. We start by considering two planet systems with fixed orbital spacing
and variable mass ratios. The basic conjecture explored in this paper is that
the planet formation process will act to distribute planetary masses in order
to achieve a minimum energy state. The resulting minimum energy configuration
--- subject to the constraint of constant angular momentum --- corresponds to
circular orbits confined to a plane, with nearly equal planetary masses (as
observed). We then generalize the treatment to include multiple planet systems,
where each adjacent pair of planets attains its (local) tidal equilibrium
state. The properties of observed planetary systems are close to those expected
from this pairwise equilibrium configuration. In contrast, observed systems do
not reside in a global minimum energy state. Both the equilibrium states of
this paper and observed multi-planet systems, with planets of nearly equal mass
on regularly spaced orbits, have an effective surface density of the form
$\sigma\propto r^{-2}$, much steeper than most disk models.

Title:Mapping the relativistic electron gas temperature across the sky,"
Abstract:  With increasing sensitivity, angular resolution, and frequency coverage,
future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments like PICO will allow us to
access new information about galaxy clusters through the relativistic thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. We will be able to map the temperature of
relativistic electrons across the entire sky, going well beyond a simple
detection of the relativistic SZ effect by cluster stacking methods that
currently define the state-of-the-art. Here, we propose a new map-based
approach utilizing SZ-temperature moment expansion and constrained-ILC methods
to extract electron gas temperature maps from foreground-obscured CMB data.
This delivers a new independent map-based observable, the electron temperature
power spectrum $T_{\rm e}^{yy}(\ell)$, which can be used to constrain cosmology
in addition to the Compton-$y$ power spectrum $C_\ell^{yy}(\ell)$ . We find
that PICO has the required sensitivity, resolution, and frequency coverage to
accurately map the electron gas temperature of galaxy clusters across the full
sky, covering a broad range of angular scales. Frequency-coverage at
$\nu\gtrsim 300\,{\rm GHz}$ plays an important role for extracting the
relativistic SZ effect in the presence of foregrounds. For Coma, PICO will
allow us to directly reconstruct the electron temperature profile using the
relativistic SZ effect. Coma's average electron temperature will be measured to
$10\sigma$ significance after foreground removal using PICO. Low-angular
resolution CMB experiment like LiteBIRD could achieve $2\sigma$ to $3\sigma$
measurement of the electron temperature of this largest cluster. Our analysis
highlights a new spectroscopic window into the thermodynamic properties of
galaxy clusters and the diffuse electron gas at large angular scales.

Abstract:  We present time-resolved 10.4-m GTC and 4.2-m WHT intermediate resolution
spectroscopy of the X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 (=ASASSN-18ey) obtained
during its decline to the quiescent state. Cross-correlation of the 21
individual spectra against late-type templates reveals a sinusoidal velocity
modulation with a period of 0.68549 +/- 0.00001 d and semi-amplitude of 417.7
+/- 3.9 km/s. We derive a mass function f(M) = 5.18 +/- 0.15 Msun, dynamically
confirming the black hole nature of the compact object. Our analysis of the
stellar absorption features supports a K3-5 spectral classification for the
donor star, which contributes 20% of the total flux at 5200-6800 Angs. The
photometric 0.703 +/- 0.003 d periodicity observed during outburst is 2.6%
longer than the orbital period supporting the presence of a superhump
modulation in the outburst lightcurves. In line with this interpretation, we
constrain the binary mass ratio to be q=0.12. In addition, we observe a sharp
increase in the Halpha emission line equivalent width during inferior
conjunction of the donor star that we interpret as a grazing eclipse of the
accretion disc and allows us to constrain the binary inclination to > 69 deg.
On the other hand, the absence of X-ray eclipses during outburst imply i < 77
deg. These inclination limits, together with our dynamical solution, lead to a
black hole mass in the range 7-8 Msun. We also measure a systemic velocity =
-21.6 +/- 2.3 km/s which, combined with the Gaia DR2 proper motion and
parallax, implies a large peculiar velocity of 100 km/s.

Title:Shock acceleration efficiency in radio relics,"
Abstract:  Radio relics in galaxy clusters are giant diffuse synchrotron sources powered
in cluster outskirts by merger shocks. Although the relic-shock connection has
been consolidated in recent years by a number of observations, the details of
the mechanisms leading to the formation of relativistic particles in this
environment are still not well understood. The diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA) theory is a commonly adopted scenario to explain the origin of cosmic
rays at astrophysical shocks, including those in radio relics in galaxy
clusters. However, in a few specific cases it has been shown that the energy
dissipated by cluster shocks is not enough to reproduce the luminosity of the
relics via DSA of thermal particles. Studies based on samples of radio relics
are required to further address this limitation of the mechanism. In this
paper, we focus on ten well-studied radio relics with underlying shocks
observed in the X-rays and calculate the electron acceleration efficiency of
these shocks that is necessary to reproduce the observed radio luminosity of
the relics. We find that in general the standard DSA cannot explain the origin
of the relics if electrons are accelerated from the thermal pool with an
efficiency significantly smaller than 10%. Our results show that other
mechanisms, such as shock re-acceleration of supra-thermal seed electrons or a
modification of standard DSA, are required to explain the formation of radio
relics.

Title:GASP. XX. From the loose spatially-resolved to the tight global SFR-Mass relation in local spiral galaxies,"
Abstract:  Exploiting the sample of 30 local star-forming, undisturbed late-type
galaxies in different environments drawn from the GAs Stripping Phenomena in
galaxies with MUSE (GASP), we investigate the spatially resolved Star Formation
Rate-Mass ({\Sigma}SFR-{\Sigma}_star) relation. Our analysis includes also the
galaxy outskirts (up to >4 effective radii, re), a regime poorly explored by
other Integral Field Spectrograph surveys. Our observational strategy allows us
to detect H{\alpha} out to more than 2.7re for 75% of the sample. Considering
all galaxies together, the correlation between the {\Sigma}SFR and
{\Sigma}_star is quite broad, with a scatter of 0.3 dex. It gets steeper and
shifts to higher {\Sigma}_star values when external spaxels are excluded and
moving from less to more massive galaxies. The broadness of the overall
relation suggests galaxy-by-galaxy variations. Indeed, each object is
characterized by a distinct {\Sigma}SFR-{\Sigma}_star relation and in some
cases the correlation is very loose. The scatter of the relation mainly arises
from the existence of bright off-center star-forming knots whose
{\Sigma}SFR-{\Sigma}_star relation is systematically broader than that of the
diffuse component. The {\Sigma}SFR-{\Sigma}tot gas (total gas surface density)
relation is as broad as the {\Sigma}SFR-{\Sigma}_star relation, indicating that
the surface gas density is not a primary driver of the relation. Even though a
large galaxy-by-galaxy variation exists, mean {\Sigma}SFR and {\Sigma}_star
values vary of at most 0.7 dex across galaxies. We investigate the relationship
between the local and global SFR-M_star relation, finding that the latter is
driven by the existence of the size-mass relation.

Title:Rapid early coeval star formation and assembly of the most massive galaxies in the universe,"
Abstract:  The current consensus on the formation and evolution of the brightest cluster
galaxies is that their stellar mass forms early ($z \gtrsim 4$) in separate
galaxies that then eventually assemble the main structure at late times ($z
\lesssim 1$). However, advances in observational techniques have led to the
discovery of protoclusters out to $z \sim 7$, suggesting that the late-assembly
picture may not be fully complete. If these protoclusters assemble rapidly in
the early universe, they should form the brightest cluster galaxies much
earlier than suspected by the late-assembly picture. Using a combination of
observationally constrained hydrodynamical and dark-matter-only simulations, we
show that the stellar assembly time of a sub-set of the brightest cluster
galaxies occurs at high redshifts ($z > 3$) rather than at low redshifts ($z <
1$), as is commonly thought. We find, using isolated non-cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations, that highly overdense protoclusters assemble their
stellar mass into brightest cluster galaxies within $\sim 1$ $\mathrm{Gyr}$ of
evolution -- producing massive blue elliptical galaxies at high redshifts ($z
\gtrsim 1.5$). We argue that there is a downsizing effect on the cluster scale
wherein some of the brightest cluster galaxies in the cores of the most-massive
clusters assemble earlier than those in lower-mass clusters. In those clusters
with $z = 0$ virial mass $\geqslant 5\times10^{14}$ M$_\mathrm{\odot}$, we find
that $9.8$% have their cores assembly early, and a higher fraction of $16.4$%
in those clusters above $10^{15}$ M$_\mathrm{\odot}$. The James Webb Space
Telescope will be able to detect and confirm our prediction in the near future,
and we discuss the implications to constraining the value of
$\sigma_\mathrm{8}$.

Title:Galactic cirri in deep optical imaging,"
Abstract:  The ubiquitous presence of Galactic cirri in deep optical images represents a
major obstacle to study the low surface brightness features of extragalactic
sources. To address this issue, we have explored the optical properties of
cirri using g, r, i and z bands in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe82
region. Using state-of-the-art, custom made, image processing techniques,
including the modeling and removal of the instrumental scattered light produced
by the stars, we managed to isolate the optical diffuse emission by the cirri,
allowing their photometric characterization. We find that their optical colors
are driven by the dust column density: The cirri become redder as their 100
$\mu$m emission increases. Remarkably, the optical colors of the Galactic cirri
differ significantly from those of extragalactic sources, with a characteristic
bluer r-i color for a given g-r, allowing one to detect these by using a simple
color relation. Our results show the high potential of deep multi-band optical
photometry, on its own, identifying the presence of cirri at a higher spatial
resolution than those provided by far-infrared observations. The combination of
very deep data and multi-band photometry (as the one produced by LSST and
Euclid) would make it possible to build dust maps of unprecedented quality.

Abstract:  We present the first observational limits on the predicted synchrotron
signals from particle Dark Matter annihilation models in dwarf spheroidal
galaxies at radio frequencies below 1 GHz. We use a combination of survey data
from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Giant Metre-wave Radio
Telescope (GMRT) to search for diffuse radio emission from 14 dwarf spheroidal
galaxies. For in-situ magnetic fields of 1 $\mu G$ and any plausible value for
the diffusion coefficient, our limits do not constrain any Dark Matter models.
However, for stronger magnetic fields our data might provide constraints
comparable to existing limits from gamma-ray and cosmic ray observations.
Predictions for the sensitivity of the upgraded MWA show that models with Dark
Matter particle mass up to $\sim$ 1.6 TeV (1 TeV) may be constrained for
magnetic field of 2 $\mu G$ (1 $\mu G$). While much deeper limits from the
future low frequency Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will challenge the LHC in
searches for Dark Matter particles, the MWA provides a valuable first step
toward the SKA at low frequencies.

Title:Evolution of black hole and galaxy growth in a semi-numerical galaxy formation model,"
Abstract:  We present a simple semi-numerical model designed to explore black hole
growth and galaxy evolution. This method builds on a previous model for black
hole accretion that uses a semi-numerical galaxy formation model and universal
Eddington ratio distribution to describe the full AGN population by
independently connecting galaxy and AGN growth to the evolution of the host
dark matter halos. We fit observed X-ray luminosity functions up to a redshift
of z ~ 4, as well as investigate the evolution of the Eddington ratio
distributions. We find that the Eddington ratio distribution evolves with
redshift such that the slope of the low-Eddington accretion rate distribution
increases with cosmic time, consistent with the behavior predicted in
hydrodynamical simulations for galaxies with different gas fractions. We also
find that the evolution of our average Eddington ratio is correlated with
observed star formation histories, supporting a picture in which black holes
and galaxies evolve together in a global sense. We further confirm the impact
of luminosity limits on observed galaxy and halo properties by applying
selection criteria to our fiducial model and comparing to surveys across a wide
range of redshifts.

Abstract:  We present a spatially-resolved analysis of ionized and molecular gas in a
nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 5728, using the VLT/MUSE and ALMA data. We find
ionized gas outflows out to ~kpc scales, which encounter the star formation
ring at 1 kpc radius. The star formation rate of the encountering region is
significantly high (~1.8 M$_{\rm sol}/yr/kpc^2$) compared to other regions in
the ring. In contrast, the CO (2-1) emission is significantly weaker by a
factor of ~3.5, indicating very high star formation efficiency. These results
support the positive feedback scenario that the AGN-driven outflows compress
the ISM in the ring, enhancing the star formation activity. In addition, we
detect outflow regions outside of spiral arms, in which gas is likely to be
removed from the spiral arms and no clear sign of star formation is detected.
The overall impact of AGN outflows on the global star formation in NGC 5728 is
limited, suggesting the feedback of the low-luminosity AGN is insignificant.

Abstract:  Imaging surveys will find many tens to hundreds of thousands of Type Ia

place them on a Hubble diagram to map the cosmological expansion. We
investigate the requirements on redshift systematics control in order not to
bias cosmological results, in particular dark energy parameter estimation. We
find that additive and multiplicative systematics must be constrained at the

robust use of photometric supernovae. Catastrophic outliers need control at the
subpercent level. We also investigate sculpting the spectroscopic sample.

Title:Estimating black hole masses: Accretion disk fitting versus reverberation mapping and single epoch,"
Abstract:  We selected a sample of 28 Type 1 AGNs for which a black hole mass has been
inferred using the reverberation mapping technique and single epoch scaling
relations. All 28 sources show clear evidence of the ""Big Blue Bump"" in the
optical-UV band whose emission is produced by an accretion disk (AD) around a
supermassive black hole. We fitted the spectrum of these sources with the
relativistic thin AD model KERRBB in order to infer the black hole masses and
compared them with those from Reverberation mapping and Single epoch methods,
discussing the possible uncertainties linked to such a model by quantifying
their weight on our results. We find that for the majority of the sources,
KERRBB is a good description of the AD emission for a wide wavelength range.
The overall uncertainty on the black hole mass estimated through the disk
fitting procedure is $\sim 0.45$ dex (which includes the uncertainty on fitting
parameters such as e.g. spin and viewing angle), comparable to the systematic
uncertainty of reverberation mapping and single epoch methods; however, such an
uncertainty can be $\leq 0.3$ dex if one of the parameters of the fit is well
constrained. Although all of the estimates are affected by large uncertainties,
the masses inferred using the three methods are compatible if the dimensionless
scale factor $f$ (linked to the unknown kinematics and geometry of the Broad
Line Region) is assumed to be larger than one. For the majority of the sources,
the comparison between the results coming from the three methods favors small
spin values. To check the goodness of the KERRBB results, we compared them with
those inferred with other models, such as AGNSED, a model that also accounts
for the emission originating from an X-ray corona: using two sources with a
good data coverage in the X band, we find that the masses estimated with the
two models differ at most by a factor of $\sim 0.2$ dex.

Title:Applying Liouville's Theorem to Gaia Data,"
Abstract:  The Milky Way is filled with the tidally-disrupted remnants of globular
clusters and dwarf galaxies. Determining the properties of these objects -- in
particular, initial masses and density profiles -- is relevant to both
astronomy and dark matter physics. However, most direct measures of mass cannot
be applied to tidal debris, as the systems of interest are no longer in
equilibrium. Since phase-space density is conserved during adiabatic phase
mixing, Liouville's theorem provides a connection between stellar kinematics as
measured by observatories such as Gaia and the original mass of the disrupted
system. Accurately recovering the phase-space density is complicated by
uncertainties resulting from measurement errors and orbital integration, which
both effectively inject entropy into the system, preferentially decreasing the
measured density. In this paper, we demonstrate that these two issues can be
overcome. First, we measure the phase-space density of the globular cluster M4
in Gaia data, and use Liouville's theorem to derive its mass. We then show
that, for tidally disrupted systems, the orbital parameters and thus
phase-space density can be inferred by minimizing the phase-space entropy of
cold stellar streams. This work is therefore a proof of principle that true
phase-space density can be measured and the original properties of the star
cluster reconstructed in systems of astrophysical interest.

Title:Beyond two-point statistics: using the minimum spanning tree as a tool for cosmology,"
Abstract:  Cosmological studies of large-scale structure have relied on two-point
statistics, not fully exploiting the rich structure of the cosmic web. In this
paper we show how to capture some of this cosmic web information by using the
minimum spanning tree (MST), for the first time using it to estimate
cosmological parameters in simulations. Discrete tracers of dark matter such as
galaxies, $N$-body particles or haloes are used as nodes to construct a unique
graph, the MST, that traces skeletal structure. We study the dependence of the
MST on cosmological parameters using haloes from a suite of COLA simulations
with a box size of $250\ h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, varying the amplitude of scalar
fluctuations $\left(A_{\rm s}\right)$, matter density $\left(\Omega_{\rm
m}\right)$, and neutrino mass $\left(\sum m_{\nu}\right)$. The power spectrum
$P$ and bispectrum $B$ are measured for wavenumbers between $0.125$ and $0.5$
$h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, while a corresponding lower cut of $\sim12.6$ $h^{-1}{\rm
Mpc}$ is applied to the MST. The constraints from the individual methods are
fairly similar but when combined we see improved $1\sigma$ constraints of $\sim
17\%$ ($\sim 12\%$) on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sim 12\%$ ($\sim 10\%$) on
$A_{\rm s}$ with respect to $P$ ($P+B$) thus showing the MST is providing
additional information. The MST can be applied to current and future
spectroscopic surveys (BOSS, DESI, Euclid, PSF, WFIRST, and 4MOST) in 3D and
photometric surveys (DES and LSST) in tomographic shells to constrain

Title:Compact object binary mergers driven by cluster tides: a new channel for LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave events,"
Abstract:  The detections of gravitational waves produced in mergers of binary black
holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS) by LIGO/Virgo have stimulated interest in the
origin of the progenitor binaries. Dense stellar systems - globular and nuclear
star clusters - are natural sites of compact object binary formation and
evolution towards merger. Here we explore a new channel for the production of
binary mergers in clusters, in which the tidal field of the cluster secularly
drives the binary to high eccentricity (even in the absence of a central
massive black hole) until gravitational wave emission becomes important. We
employ the recently developed secular theory of cluster tide-driven binary
evolution to compute present day merger rates for BH-BH, NS-BH and NS-NS
binaries, varying cluster potential and central concentration of the binary
population (but ignoring cluster evolution and stellar flybys for now). Unlike
other mechanisms, this new dynamical channel can produce a significant number
of mergers out to cluster-centric distances of several pc. For NS-NS binaries
we find merger rates in the range $0.01-0.07$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ from
globular clusters and $0.1-0.2$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ from cusped nuclear
clusters. For NS-BH and BH-BH binaries we find small merger rates from globular
clusters, but a rate of $0.1 - 0.2$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ from cusped nuclear
clusters, contributing to the observed LIGO/Virgo rate at the level of several
per cent. Therefore, cluster tide-driven mergers constitute a new channel that
can be further explored with current and future gravitational wave detectors.

Title:Detectability of Collective Neutrino Oscillation Signatures in the Supernova Explosion of a 8.8 $M_\odot$ star,"
Abstract:  In order to investigate the impact of collective neutrino oscillations (CNO)
on the neutrino signal from a nearby supernova, we perform 3-flavor neutrino
oscillation simulations employing the multiangle effect. The background
hydrodynamic model is based on the neutrino hydrodynamic simulation of a 8.8
\Msun progenitor star. We find that CNO commences after some 100 ms post
bounce. Before this, CNO is suppressed by matter-induced decoherence. In the
inverted mass hierarchy, the spectrum of $\bar{\nu}_e$ becomes softer after the
onset of CNO. To evaluate the detectability of this modification, we define a
hardness ratio between the number of high energy neutrino events and low energy
neutrino events adopting a fixed critical energy. We show that Hyper-Kamiokande
(HK) can distinguish the effect of CNO for supernova distances out to $\sim 10$
kpc. On the other hand, for the normal mass hierarchy, the spectrum of $\nu_e$
becomes softer after the onset of CNO, and we show that DUNE can distinguish
this feature for supernova distances out to $\sim 10$ kpc. More work is
necessary to optimize the best value of critical energy for maximum
sensitivity. We also show that if the spectrum of $\bar{\nu}_e$ in HK becomes
softer due to CNO, the spectrum of $\nu_e$ in DUNE becomes harder, and vice
versa. This synergistic observations in $\bar{\nu}_e$ and $\nu_e$, by HK and
DUNE respectively, will be an intriguing opportunity to test the occurrence of
CNO.

Title:Constraining nuclear star cluster formation using MUSE-AO observations of the early-type galaxy FCC47,"
Abstract:  Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are found in at least 70% of all galaxies, but
their formation path is still unclear. In the most common scenarios, NSCs form
in-situ from the galaxy's central gas reservoir, through merging of globular
clusters (GCs), or through a combination of the two. As the scenarios pose
different expectations for angular momentum and stellar population properties
of the NSC in comparison to the host galaxy and the GC system, it is necessary
to characterise the stellar light, NSC and GCs simultaneously. The large NSC
(r$_\rm{eff} = 66$ pc) and rich GC system of the early-type Fornax cluster
galaxy FCC47 (NGC1336) render this galaxy an ideal laboratory to constrain NSC
formation. Using MUSE science verification data assisted by adaptive optics, we
obtained maps for the stellar kinematics and for stellar-population properties
of FCC47. We extracted the spectra of the central NSC and determined
line-of-sight velocities of 24 GCs and metallicities of five. FCC47 shows two
decoupled components (KDCs): a rotating disk and the NSC. Our orbit-based
dynamical Schwarzschild model revealed that the NSC is a distinct kinematic
feature and it constitutes the peak of metallicity and old ages in the galaxy.
The main body consists of two counter-rotating populations and is dominated by
a more metal-poor population. The GC system is bimodal with a dominant
metal-poor population and the total GC system mass is $\sim 17\%$ of the NSC
mass ($\sim$ 7 $\times$ $10^8 M_\odot$). The rotation, high metallicity and
high mass of the NSC cannot be uniquely explained by GC-inspiral and most
likely requires additional, but quickly quenched, in-situ formation. The
presence of two KDCs most probably are evidence of a major merger that has
altered the structure of FCC47 significantly, indicating the important role of
galaxy mergers in forming the complex kinematics in the galaxy-NSC system.

Title:Broad-band spectral study of X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 using Swift/XRT and NuSTAR,"
Abstract:  We report on a \textit{NuSTAR} and \textit{Swift}/XRT observation of the
newly discovered X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070. \textit{Swift}/XRT and
\textit{NuSTAR} have concurrently observed the newly detected source on 14
March 2018. We have simultaneously fitted the broad-band spectra obtained from
\textit{Swift}/XRT and \textit{NuSTAR}. The observed joint spectra in the
energy range 0.6--78.0 keV are well modeled with a weak disk black-body
emission, dominant thermal Comptonization and relativistic reflection fraction.
We have detected a fluorescent Iron-K$\alpha$ line relativistically broadened,
and a Compton hump at $\sim$ 30 keV. We constrain the inner disk radius as well
as the disk inclination angle and their values are found to be
4.1$^{+0.8}_{-0.6}$ R$_{ISCO}$ (where R$_{ISCO}\equiv$ radius of the innermost
stable circular orbit) or 5.1$^{+1.0}_{-0.7}$ r$_{g}$ (where r$_{g}\equiv$
gravitational radius) and 29.8$^{+3.0}_{-2.7}$ $^\circ$ respectively. The best
fit broad-band spectra suggest that the source was in the hard state and
evolving. The source emission is best described by weak thermal emission along
with strong thermal Comptonization from a relatively cold, optically thick,
geometrically thin and ionized accretion disk. X-ray spectral modeling helps us
to understand the accretion and ejection properties in the vicinity of the
compact object.

Title:SN 2017gmr: An energetic Type II-P supernova with asymmetries,"
Abstract:  We present high-cadence ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR)
data on the luminous Type II-P supernova SN 2017gmr from hours after discovery
through the first 180 days. SN 2017gmr does not show signs of narrow,
high-ionization emission lines in the early optical spectra, yet the optical
lightcurve evolution suggests that an extra energy source from circumstellar
medium (CSM) interaction must be present for at least 2 days after explosion.
Modeling of the early lightcurve indicates a ~500R$_{\odot}$ progenitor radius,
consistent with a rather compact red supergiant, and late-time luminosities
indicate up to 0.130 $\pm$ 0.026 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni are present, if the
lightcurve is solely powered by radioactive decay, although the $^{56}$Ni mass
may be lower if CSM interaction contributes to the post-plateau luminosity.
Prominent multi-peaked emission lines of H$\alpha$ and [O I] emerge after day
154, as a result of either an asymmetric explosion or asymmetries in the CSM.
The lack of narrow lines within the first two days of explosion in the likely
presence of CSM interaction may be an example of close, dense, asymmetric CSM
that is quickly enveloped by the spherical supernova ejecta.

Title:Discovery of recombining plasma inside the extended gamma-ray supernova remnant HB9,"
Abstract:  We present the results from the Suzaku X-ray Imaging Spectrometer observation
of the mixed-morphology supernova remnant (SNR) HB9 (G160.9+2.6). We discovered
recombining plasma (RP) in the western Suzaku observation region and the
spectra here are well described by a model having collisional ionization
equilibrium (CIE) and RP components. On the other hand, the X-ray spectra from
the eastern Suzaku observation region are best reproduced by the CIE and
non-equilibrium ionization model. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the
origin of the RP emission based on the observational properties and concluded
that the rarefaction scenario is a possible explanation for the existence of
RP. In addition, the gamma-ray emission morphology and spectrum within the
energy range of 0.2$-$300 GeV are investigated using $\sim$10 years of data
from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The gamma-ray morphology of HB9 is
best described by the spatial template of radio continuum emission. The
spectrum is well-fit to a log-parabola function and its detection significance
was found to be $\sim$25$\sigma$. Moreover, a new gamma-ray point source
located just outside the south-east region of the SNR's shell was detected with
a significance of $\sim$6$\sigma$. We also investigated the archival HI and CO
data and detected an expanding shell structure in the velocity range of $-10.5$
and $+1.8$ km s$^{-1}$ that is coinciding with a region of gamma-ray
enhancement at the southern rim of the HB9 shell.

Title:Synergies between space telescopes in the photometric characterization of the atmospheres of Hot Jupiters,"
Abstract:  Previous generation of instruments have the opportunity to discover thousands
of extra-solar planets and more will come with the current and future
planet-search missions. In order to go one step further in the characterization
of exoplanets, in this paper we describe a way to compare the photometric
observation of Hot Jupiters done with space telescopes such as HST, CHEOPS,
TESS, PLATO, and JWST and give the first-hand characterization on their
atmospheres. We analyze a set of planetary systems hosting a Hot Jupiter for
which an atmospheric template is available in the literature. For each system,
we simulate the transit light curves observed by different instruments,
convolving the incoming spectrum with the corresponding instrumental
throughput. For each instrument, we thus measure the expected transit depth and
estimate the associated uncertainty. Finally, we compare the transit depths as
seen by the selected instruments and we quantify the effect of the planetary
atmosphere on multi-band transit photometry. We also analyze a set of simulated
scenarios with different stellar magnitudes, activity levels, transit durations
and atmospheric templates to find the best cases for this kind of observational
approach. We find in general that current and especially future space
telescopes provide enough photometric precision to detect significant
differences between the transit depths at different wavelengths. In particular,
we find that the chromatic effect due to the atmosphere of the Hot Jupiters is
maximized at later spectral types and that the effect of stellar activity is
smaller than the measurement uncertainties.

Title:Kinematic Constraints on Spatial Curvature from Supernovae Ia and Cosmic Chronometers,"
Abstract:  An approach to estimate the spatial curvature $\Omega_k$ from data
independently of dynamical models is suggested, through kinematic
parameterizations of the comoving distance ($D_{C}(z)$) with third degree
polynomial, of the Hubble parameter ($H(z)$) with a second degree polynomial
and of the deceleration parameter ($q(z)$) with first order polynomial. All
these parameterizations were done as function of redshift $z$. We used SNe Ia
dataset from Pantheon compilation with 1048 distance moduli estimated in the
range $0.01<z<2.3$ with systematic and statistical errors and a compilation of
31 $H(z)$ data estimated from cosmic chronometers. The spatial curvature found
for $D_C(z)$ parametrization was $\Omega_{k}=-0.03^{+0.24+0.56}_{-0.30-0.53}$.
The parametrization for deceleration parameter $q(z)$ resulted in
$\Omega_{k}=-0.08^{+0.21+0.54}_{-0.27-0.45}$. The $H(z)$ parametrization has
shown incompatibilities between $H(z)$ and SNe Ia data constraints, so these
analyses were not combined. The $D_C(z)$ and $q(z)$ parametrizations are
compatible with the spatially flat Universe as predicted by many inflation
models and data from CMB. This type of analysis is very appealing as it avoids
any bias because it does not depend on assumptions about the matter content of
the Universe for estimating $\Omega_k$.

Title:BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey: XVI. General Physical Characteristics of BAT Blazars,"
Abstract:  The recently released 105-month {\it Swift}-Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
all-sky hard X-ray survey catalog presents an opportunity to study
astrophysical objects detected in the deepest look at the entire hard X-ray
(14$-$195 keV) sky. Here we report the results of a multifrequency study of 146
blazars from this catalog, quadrupling the number compared to past studies, by
utilizing recent data from the {\it Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT),
Swift-BAT, and archival measurements. In our $\gamma$-ray analysis of $\sim$10
years of the LAT data, 101 are found as $\gamma$-ray emitters, whereas, 45
remains LAT undetected. We model the broadband spectral energy distributions
with a synchrotron-inverse Compton radiative model. On average, BAT detected
sources host massive black holes ($M_{\rm bh}\sim10^9$ M$_{\odot}$) and
luminous accretion disks ($L_{\rm d}\sim10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$). At
high-redshifts ($z>2$), BAT blazars host more powerful jets with luminous
accretion disks compared to those detected only with the {\it Fermi}-LAT. We
find good agreement in the black hole masses derived from the single-epoch
optical spectroscopic measurements and standard accretion disk modeling
approaches. Other physical properties of BAT blazars are similar to those known
for {\it Fermi}-LAT detected objects.

Title:A Genetic Algorithm for Astroparticle Physics Studies,"
Abstract:  Precision measurements of charged cosmic rays have recently been carried out
by space-born (e.g. AMS-02), or ground experiments (e.g. HESS). These measured
data are important for the studies of astro-physical phenomena, including
supernova remnants, cosmic ray propagation, solar physics and dark matter.
Those scenarios usually contain a number of free parameters that need to be
adjusted by observed data. Some techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo
and MultiNest, are developed in order to solve the above problem. However, it
is usually required a computing farm to apply those tools. In this paper, a
genetic algorithm for finding the optimum parameters for cosmic ray injection
and propagation is presented. We find that this algorithm gives us the same
best fit results as the Markov Chain Monte Carlo but consuming less computing
power by nearly 2 orders of magnitudes.

well above the Jupiter Family of comets values. This tells us something about

Title:Rotational evolution of the Vela pulsar during the 2016 glitch,"
Abstract:  The 2016 Vela glitch observed by the Mt Pleasant radio telescope provides the
first opportunity to study pulse-to-pulse dynamics of a pulsar glitch, opening
up new possibilities to study the neutron star's interior. We fit models of the
star's rotation frequency to the pulsar data, and present three new results.
First, we constrain the glitch rise time to less than 12.6s with 90%
confidence, almost three times shorter than the previous best constraint.
Second, we find definitive evidence for a rotational-frequency overshoot and
fast relaxation following the glitch. Third, we find evidence for a slow-down
of the star's rotation immediately prior to the glitch. The overshoot is
predicted theoretically by some models; we discuss implications of the glitch
rise and overshoot decay times on internal neutron-star physics. The slow down
preceding the glitch is unexpected; we propose the slow-down may trigger the
glitch by causing a critical lag between crustal superfluid and the crust.

Title:Fitting functions on the cheap: the relative nonlinear matter power spectrum,"
Abstract:  We propose an alternative approach to the construction of fitting functions
to the nonlinear matter power spectrum extracted from $N$-body simulations
based on the relative matter power spectrum $\delta(k,a)$, defined as the
fractional deviation in the absolute matter power spectrum produced by a target
cosmology away from a reference $\Lambda$CDM prediction. From the computational
perspective, $\delta(k,a)$ is fairly insensitive to the specifics of the
simulation settings, and numerical convergence at the 1%-level can be readily
achieved without the need for huge computing capacity. Furthermore,
$\delta(k,a)$ exhibits several interesting properties that enable a piece-wise
construction of the full fitting function, whereby component fitting functions
are sought for single-parameter variations and then multiplied together to form
the final product. Then, to obtain 1%-accurate absolute power spectrum
predictions for any target cosmology only requires that the community as a
whole invests in producing one single ultra-precise reference $\Lambda$CDM
absolute power spectrum, to be combined with the fitting function to produce
the desired result. To illustrate the power of this approach, we have
constructed the fitting function RelFit using only five relatively inexpensive
$w$CDM simulations (box length $L=256 h^{-1}$Mpc, $N=1024^3$ particles,
initialised at $z_i=49$). In a 6-parameter space spanning
$\{\omega_m,A_s,n_s,w,\omega_b,h\}$, the output relative power spectra of
RelFit are consistent with the predictions of the CosmicEmu emulator to 1% or
better for a wide range of cosmologies up to $k\simeq 10$/Mpc. Thus, our
approach could provide an inexpensive and democratically accessible route to
fulfilling the 1%-level accuracy demands of the upcoming generation of
large-scale structure probes, especially in the exploration of ""non-standard""
or ""exotic"" cosmologies on nonlinear scales.

Title:Multimessenger Asteroseismology of Core-Collapse Supernovae,"
Abstract:  We investigate correlated gravitational wave and neutrino signals from
rotating core-collapse supernovae with simulations. Using an improved mode
identification procedure based on mode function matching, we show that a linear
quadrupolar mode of the core produces a dual imprint on gravitational waves and
neutrinos in the early post-bounce phase of the supernova. The angular
harmonics of the neutrino emission are consistent with the mode energy around
the neutrinospheres, which points to a mechanism for the imprint on neutrinos.
Thus, neutrinos carry information about the mode amplitude in the outer region
of the core, whereas gravitational waves probe deeper in. We also find that the
best-fit mode function has a frequency bounded above by $\sim 420$ Hz, and yet
the mode's frequency in our simulations is $\sim 15\%$ higher, due to the use
of Newtonian hydrodynamics and a widely used pseudo-Newtonian gravity
approximation. This overestimation is particularly important for the analysis
of gravitational wave detectability and asteroseismology, pointing to
limitations of pseudo-Newtonian approaches for these purposes, possibly even
resulting in excitation of incorrect modes. In addition, mode frequency
matching (as opposed to mode function matching) could be resulting in mode
misidentification in recent work. Lastly, we evaluate the prospects of a
multimessenger detection of the mode using current technology. The detection of
the imprint on neutrinos is most challenging, with a maximum detection distance
of $\sim\!1$ kpc using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The maximum distance
for detecting the complementary gravitational wave imprint is $\sim\!5$ kpc
using Advanced LIGO at design sensitivity.

Title:Multi-TeV flaring in nearby High Energy Blazars: A photohadronic scenario,"
Abstract:  Blazars are a subclass of AGN and flaring in multi-TeV gamma-ray seems to be
the major activity in high energy blazars a subgrup of blazars. Flaring is also
unpredictable and switches between quiescent and active states involving
different time scales and fluxes. While in some high energy blazars a strong
temporal correlation between X-ray and multi-TeV gamma-ray has been observed,
outbursts in some other have no low energy counterparts and explanation of such
extreme activity needs to be addressed through different mechanisms as it is
not understood well. The extragalactic background light (EBL) plays an
important role in the observation of these high energy gamma-rays as it
attenuates through pair production of electron-positron and also changes the
spectral shape of the high energy photons. In the context of the photohadronic
model and taking EBL correction into account, flaring can be explained very
well. In a series of papers we have developed this model to explain multi-TeV
flaring events form many blazars. Here in this review, the photohadronic model
is discussed and applied to explain the multi-TeV flaring from nearby high
energy blazars: Markarian 421, Markarian 501 and 1ES1959+650.

Title:On the reliability of magnetic energy and helicity computations based on nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic field models,"
Abstract:  We demonstrate the sensitivity of magnetic energy and helicity computations
regarding the quality of the underlying coronal magnetic field model. We apply
the method of Wiegelmann & Inhester (2010) to a series of SDO/HMI vector
magnetograms, and discuss nonlinear force-free (NLFF) solutions based on two
different sets of the free model parameters. The two time series differ from
each other concerning their force-free and solenoidal quality. Both force- and
divergence-freeness are required for a consistent NLFF solution. Full
satisfaction of the solenoidal property is inherent in the definition of
relative magnetic helicity in order to insure gauge-independence. We apply two
different magnetic helicity computation methods (Thalmann et al. 2011; Valori
et al. 2012) to both NLFF time series and find that the output is highly
dependent on the level to which the NLFF magnetic fields satisfy the
divergence-free condition, with the computed magnetic energy being less
sensitive than the relative helicity. Proxies for the non-potentiality and
eruptivity derived from both quantities are also shown to depend strongly on
the solenoidal property of the NLFF fields. As a reference for future
applications, we provide quantitative thresholds for the force- and
divergence-freeness, for the assurance of reliable computation of magnetic
energy and helicity, and of their related eruptivity proxies.

Abstract:  Evolutionary calculations of population I stars with initial masses
$M_0=1M_\odot$, $1.5M_\odot$ and $2M_\odot$ were carried out up to the stage of
the proto--planetary nebula. Selected models of post--AGB evolutionary
sequences with effective temperatures $3.6\times 10^3\,\mathrm{K}\lesssim
T_\mathrm{eff}\lesssim 2\times 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$ were used as initial
conditions in calculations of self--escited stellar oscillations. For the first
time the sequences of hydrodynamic models of radially pulsating post--AGB stars
were computed using the self--consistent solution of the equations of radiation
hydrodynamics and time--dependent convection. Within this range of effective
temperatures the post--AGB stars are the fundamental mode pulsators with period
decreasing as the star evolves from $\Pi\approx 300$ day to several days.
Period fluctuations are due to nonlinear effects and are most prominent at
effective temperatures $T_\mathrm{eff} < 5000$K. The amplitude of bolometric
light variations is $\Delta M_\mathrm{bol}\approx 1$ at $T_\mathrm{eff}
\lesssim 6000$K and rapidly decreases with increasing $T_\mathrm{eff}$. The
theoretical dependence of the pulsation period as a function of effective
temperature obtained in the study can be used as a criterion for the
evolutionary status of pulsating variables suspected to be post--AGB stars.

Title:Masses of the Hyades white dwarfs: A gravitational redshift measurement,"
Abstract:  Context. It is possible to accurately measure the masses of the white dwarfs
(WDs) in the Hyades cluster using gravitational redshift, because the radial
velocity of the stars can be obtained independently of spectroscopy from
astrometry and the cluster has a low velocity dispersion. Aims. We aim to
obtain an accurate measurement of the Hyades WD masses by determining the
mass-to-radius ratio (M/R) from the observed gravitational redshift, and to
compare them with masses derived from other methods. Methods. We analyse
archive high-resolution UVES-VLT spectra of six WDs belonging to the Hyades to
measure their Doppler shift, from which M/R is determined after subtracting the
astrometric radial velocity. We estimate the radii using Gaia photometry as
well as literature data. Results. The M/R error associated to the gravitational
redshift measurement is about 5%. The radii estimates, evaluated with different
methods, are in very good agreement, though they can differ by up to 4%
depending on the quality of the data. The masses based on gravitational
redshift are systematically smaller than those derived from other methods, by a
minimum of $\sim 0.02$ up to 0.05 solar masses. While this difference is within
our measurement uncertainty, the fact that it is systematic indicates a likely
real discrepancy between the different methods. Conclusions. We show that the
M/R derived from gravitational redshift measurements is a powerful tool to
determine the masses of the Hyades WDs and could reveal interesting properties
of their atmospheres. The technique can be improved by using dedicated
spectrographs, and can be extended to other clusters, making it unique in its
ability to accurately and empirically determine the masses of WDs in open
clusters. At the same time we prove that gravitational redshift in WDs agrees
with the predictions of stellar evolution models to within a few percent.

Compared to IDPs or particles collected during the Stardust mission, dust
collected in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the Rosetta

whose structural properties can be used to further the investigation of our

resolution of imaging possible with the MIDAS Atomic Force Microscope on-board
Rosetta. 3D topographic images with resolutions of down to 8\,nm are analysed
to determine the subunit sizes of particles on the nanometre scale. Three
morphological classes can be determined, namely (i) fragile agglomerate
particles of sizes larger than about 10\,$\mathrm{\mu m}$ comprised by
micrometre-sized subunits that may be again aggregates and show a moderate
packing density on the surface of the particles; (ii) a fragile agglomerate
with a size about few tens of micrometres comprised by micrometre-sized
subunits suggested to be again aggregates and arranged in a structure with a
fractal dimension less than two; (iii) small, micrometre-sized particles
comprised by subunits in the hundreds of nanometres size range that show
surface features suggested to again represent subunits. Their differential size
distributions follow a log-normal distribution with means about 100\,nm and
standard deviations between 20 and 35\,nm. All micrometre-sized particles are
hierarchical dust agglomerates of smaller subunits. The arrangement, appearance
and size distribution of the smallest determined surface features are
reminiscent of those found in CP IDPs and they represent the smallest directly
detected subunits of comet 67P.

Title:Elemental and isotopic variability in solar system materials by mixing and processing of primordial disk reservoirs,"
Abstract:  Isotope anomalies among planetary bodies provide key constraints on planetary
genetics and the Solar System's dynamical evolution. However, to unlock the
full potential of these anomalies for constraining the processing, mixing, and
transport of material in the disk it is essential to identify the main
components responsible for producing planetary-scale isotope variations, and to
investigate how they relate to the isotopic heterogeneity inherited from the
Solar System's parental molecular cloud. To address these issues we measured
the Ti and Sr isotopic compositions of Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) from the
Allende CV3 chondrite, as well as acid leachates and an insoluble residue from
the Murchison CM2 chondrite, and combine these results with literature data for
presolar grains, hibonites, chondrules, and bulk meteorites. Our analysis
reveals that the mineral-scale nebular isotopic heterogeneity as sampled by
leachates and presolar grains is largely decoupled from the planetary-scale
isotope anomalies. Combining isotope anomaly data for a large number of
elements reveals that the difference between non-carbonaceous (NC) and
carbonaceous (CC) meteorites is the product of mixing between NC material and a
nebular reservoir (termed IC) whose isotopic composition is similar to that of
CAIs, but whose chemical composition is similar to bulk chondrites. In our
preferred model, the distinct isotopic compositions of these two nebular
reservoirs reflect an inherited heterogeneity of the solar system's parental
molecular cloud core, which therefore has never been fully homogenized during
collapse. Planetary-scale isotopic anomalies are thus caused by variable mixing
of isotopically distinct primordial disk reservoirs, the selective processing
of these reservoirs in different nebular environments, and the heterogeneous
distribution of the thereby forming nebular products.

Title:The Concentration and Growth of Solids in Fragmenting Circumstellar Disks,"
Abstract:  Due to the gas rich environments of early circumstellar disks, the
gravitational collapse of cool, dense regions of the disk form fragments
largely composed of gas. During formation, disk fragments may attain increased
metallicities as they interact with the surrounding disk material, whether
through particle migration to pressure maxima or through mutual gravitational
interaction. In this paper, we investigate the ability of fragments to collect
and retain a significant solid component through gas-particle interactions in
high-resolution 3D self-gravitating shearing box simulations. The formation of
axissymmetric perturbations associated with gravitational instabilities allows
particles of intermediate sizes to concentrate through aerodynamic drag forces.
By the onset of fragmentation, the mass of local particle concentrations within
the fragment are comparable to that of the gas component and the sebsequent
gravitational collapse results in the formation of a solid core. We find that
these cores can be up to several tens of Earth masses, depending on grain size,
before the fragment center reaches temperatures which would sublimate solids.
The solid fraction and total mass of the fragment also depend on the
metallicity of the young parent protoplanetary disk, with higher initial
metallicities resulting in larger fragments and larger solid cores.
Additionally, the extended atmospheres of these soon-to-be gas giants or brown
dwarfs are occasionally enriched above the initial metallicity, provided no
solid core forms in the center and are otherwise lacking in heavier elements
when a core does form.

a cool, low-mass star and a white dwarf with a spin period of 1.95 min. Optical
observations by Buckley et al. showed that the polarimetric emission from the
white dwarf is strongly linearly polarised ( up to $\sim40\%$) with
periodically changing intensities. This periodic non-thermal emission is
thought to be powered by the highly magnetised ($ 5 \times 10^{8} $ G) white
dwarf that is spinning down. The morphology of the polarisation signal, namely
the position angle plotted against the phase angle, is similar to that seen in
many radio pulsars. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can fit the
traditional pulsar rotating vector model to the optical position angle. We used
a Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo technique to find the best fit for the model
yielding a magnetic inclination angle of $\alpha =
(86.6^{+3.0}_{-2.8})^{\circ}$ and an observer angle of $\zeta =
(60.5^{+5.3}_{-6.1})^{\circ}$. This modelling supports the scenario that the
synchrotron emission originates above the polar caps of the white dwarf pulsar
and that the latter is an orthogonal rotator.

Title:Gravitational waves from phase transition of NS to QS,"
Abstract:  In this article, we perform a 2-d simulation of combustion of neutron star
(NS) to hybrid star (HS). We assume that a sudden density fluctuation at the
center of the NS initiates a shock discontinuity near the center of the star.
This shock discontinuity deconfines NM to 2-f QM, initiating combustion of the
star. This combustion front propagates from the center to the surface
converting NM to 2-f QM. This combustion stops at a radius of $6 km$ inside the
star, as at this density the NM is much stable than QM. Beyond $6 km$ although
the combustion stops but the shock wave propagates to the surface. We study the
gravitational wave signal for such a PT of NS to HS. We find that such PT has
unique GW strain of amplitude $10^{-22}$. These signals last for few tens of
$\mu s$ and shows small oscillating behaviour. The power spectrum consists of
peaks and at fairly high frequency range. The conversion to NS to HS has a
unique signature which would help in defining the PT and the fate of the NS.

Title:Acoustic oscillations and dynamo action in the G8 sub-giant EK Eri,"
Abstract:  We present further evidence of the presence of acoustic oscillations on the
slowly-rotating, over-active G8 sub-giant EK Eri. This star was observed with
the 1-m Hertzsprung SONG telescope, at the Observatorio del Teide for two
different runs of 8 and 13 nights, respectively, and separated by about a year.
We determined a significant excess of power around $\nu_\mathrm{max} = 253 \pm
3\,\mu$Hz in the first observing run and we were able to determine the large
separation $\Delta\nu = 16.43 \pm 0.22\,\mu$Hz. No significant excess of power
was instead detected in a subsequent SONG observing season, as also supported
by our analysis of the simultaneous TESS photometric observations. We propose a
new amplitude-luminosity relation in order to account for the missing power in
the power spectrum. Based on the evolutionary stage of this object we argue
that standard $\alpha^2\Omega$ dynamo cannot be excluded as a possible origin
for the observed magnetic field.

Title:Revisiting the impact of stellar magnetic activity on the detectability of solar-like oscillations by Kepler,"
Abstract:  Over 2,000 stars were observed for one month with a high enough cadence in
order to look for acoustic modes during the survey phase of the Kepler mission.
Solar-like oscillations have been detected in about 540 stars. The question of
why no oscillations were detected in the remaining stars is still open.
Previous works explained the non-detection of modes with the high level of
magnetic activity. However, the studied stars contained some classical
pulsators and red giants that could have biased the results. In this work, we
revisit this analysis on a cleaner sample of 1,014 main-sequence solar-like
stars. First we compute the predicted amplitude of the modes. We find that the
stars with detected modes have an amplitude to noise ratio larger than 0.94. We
measure reliable rotation periods and the associated photometric magnetic index
for 684 stars and in particular for 323 stars where the mode amplitude is
predicted to be high enough to be detected. We find that among these 323 stars
32% have a magnetic activity level larger than the Sun at maximum activity,
explaining the non-detection of p modes. Interestingly, magnetic activity
cannot be the primary reason responsible for the absence of detectable modes in
the remaining 68% of the stars without p modes detected and with reliable
rotation periods. Thus, we investigate metallicity, inclination angle, and
binarity as possible causes of low mode amplitudes. Using spectroscopic
observations for a subsample, we find that a low metallicity could be the
reason for suppressed modes. No clear correlation with binarity nor inclination
is found. We also derive the lower limit for our photometric activity index (of
20-30 ppm) below which rotation and magnetic activity are not detected. Finally
with our analysis we conclude that stars with a photometric activity index
larger than 2,000 ppm have 98.3% probability of not having oscillations
detected.

Title:The slingshot effect as a probe of transverse motions of galaxies,"
Abstract:  There are currently no reliable methods to measure transverse velocities of
galaxies. This is an important piece of information that could allow us to
probe the physics of structure formation as well as testing the underlying
theory of gravity. The slingshot effect, a special case of the Integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect, is expected to create dipole signals in the temperature
fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB). This effect
creates a hot spot behind and a cold spot in front of moving massive objects.
The dipole signal created by the slingshot effect can be used to measure
transverse velocities, but because the signal is expected to be weak, the
effect has not been measured yet. The aim is to show that the slingshot effect
can be measured by stacking the signals of galaxies falling into a collapsing
cluster. We evaluate if the effect can probe modified gravity. We use data from
a simulated galaxy catalogue (MDPL2) to mimic observations. We identify a
massive galaxy cluster, and make maps of the slingshot effect around infalling
galaxies. We add uncorrelated Gaussian noise to each map. The maps are rotated
according to the direction to the cluster centre, such that the dipole signal
will add up constructively when stacking. We compare each stack to a dipole
stencil and we find the probability for a false positive in the absence of the
slingshot signal. Each galaxy gives a signal of around $\Delta T/T \approx
10^{-9}$, while the precision of CMB experiments of today are $\Delta T/T
\approx 4 \times 10^{-6}$. By stacking around 10 000 galaxies, the slingshot
signal can be over the detectable threshold with experiments of today. However,
future CMB experiments must be used to be certain of the strength of the
observed signal.

Title:Search for gravitational-wave signals associated with gamma-ray bursts during the second observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo,"
Abstract:  We present the results of targeted searches for gravitational-wave transients
associated with gamma-ray bursts during the second observing run of Advanced
LIGO and Advanced Virgo, which took place from 2016 November to 2017 August. We
have analyzed 98 gamma-ray bursts using an unmodeled search method that
searches for generic transient gravitational waves and 42 with a modeled search
method that targets compact-binary mergers as progenitors of short gamma-ray
bursts. Both methods clearly detect the previously reported binary merger
signal GW170817, with p-values of $<9.38 \times 10^{-6}$ (modeled) and $3.1
\times 10^{-4}$ (unmodeled). We do not find any significant evidence for
gravitational-wave signals associated with the other gamma-ray bursts analyzed,
and therefore we report lower bounds on the distance to each of these, assuming
various source types and signal morphologies. Using our final modeled search
results, short gamma-ray burst observations, and assuming binary neutron star
progenitors, we place bounds on the rate of short gamma-ray bursts as a
function of redshift for $z \leq 1$. We estimate 0.07-1.80 joint detections
with Fermi-GBM per year for the 2019-20 LIGO-Virgo observing run and 0.15-3.90
per year when current gravitational-wave detectors are operating at their

Title:Thermally driven wind as the origin of warm absorbers in AGN,"
Abstract:  Warm absorbers are present in many Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), seen as
mildly ionised gas outflowing with velocities of a few hundred to a few
thousand kilometres per second. These slow velocities imply a large launch
radius, pointing to the broad line region and/or torus as the origin of this
material. Thermal driving was originally suggested as a plausible mechanism for
launching this material but recent work has focused instead on magnetic winds,
unifying these slow, mildly ionised winds with the more highly ionised
ultra-fast outflows. Here we use the recently developed quantitative models for
thermal winds in black hole binary systems to predict the column density,
velocity and ionisation state from AGN. Thermal winds are sensitive to the
spectral energy distribution (SED), so we use realistic models for SEDs which
change as a function of mass and mass accretion rate, becoming X-ray weaker
(and hence more disc dominated) at higher Eddington ratio. These models allow
us to predict the launch radius, velocity, column density and ionisation state
of thermal winds as well as the mass loss rate and energetics. While these
match well to some of the observed properties of warm absorbers, the data point
to the presence of additional wind material, most likely from dust driving.

Title:Enhanced cosmological perturbations and the merger rate of PBH binaries,"
Abstract:  The rate of merger events observed by LIGO/Virgo can be used in order to
probe the fraction $f$ of dark mater in the form of Primordial Black Holes.
Here, we consider the merger rate of PBH binaries, accounting for the effect of
cosmological perturbations on their initial eccentricity $e$. The torque on the
binaries receives significant contributions from a wide range of scales, that
goes from the size of the horizon at the time when the binary forms, down to
the co-moving size of the binary. In scenarios where PBH are formed from
adiabatic perturbations, it is natural to expect an enhancement of the power
spectrum $P_\Phi$ at small scales, where it is poorly constrained
observationally. The effect can then be quite significant. For instance, a
nearly flat spectrum with amplitude $P_\Phi \gtrsim 10^{-7}$ on scales smaller
than $\sim 10 Mpc^{-1}$ gives a contribution $\langle j^2 \rangle \sim 10^3
P_\Phi$, where $j= (1-e^2)^{1/2}$ is the dimensionless angular momentum
parameter of the binaries. This contribution can dominate over tidal torques
from neighboring PBHs for any value of $f$. Current constraints allow for a
power spectrum as large as $P_\Phi \sim 10^{-5}$ at the intermediate scales
$10^3-10^5 Mpc^{-1}$, comparable to the co-moving size of the binaries at the
time of formation. In particular, this can relax current bounds on the PBH
abundance based on the observed LIGO/Virgo merger rate, allowing for a fraction
$f\sim 10\%$ of dark matter in PBH of mass $\sim 30 M_\odot$. We investigate
the differential merger rate $\Delta\Gamma(m_1,m_2)$, as a function of the
masses of the binary components, and the corresponding ``universality""
coefficient $\alpha = -(m_1+m_2)^2 \partial^2 \ln \Delta\Gamma/\partial
m_1\partial m_2$, concluding that merger rates may provide valuable information
on the spectrum of primordial cosmological perturbations at currently uncharted
lengthscales.

Title:Correct estimate of the probability of false detection of the matched filter in weak-signal detection problems. III (Peak distribution method versus the Gumbel distribution method),"
Abstract:  The matched filter (MF) represents one of the main tools to detect signals
from known sources embedded in the noise. In the Gaussian case the noise is
assumed to be the realization of a Gaussian random field (GRF). The most
important property of the MF, the maximization of the probability of detection
subject to a constant probability of false detection or false alarm (PFA),
makes it one of the most popular techniques. However, the MF technique relies
upon the a priori knowledge of the number and the position of the searched
signals in the GRF which usually are not available. A typical way out is to
assume that the position of a signal coincides with one of the peaks in the
matched filtered data. A detection is claimed when the probability that a given
peak is due only to the noise (i.e. the PFA) is smaller than a prefixed
threshold. In this case the probability density function (PDF) of the
amplitudes has to be used for the computation of the PFA, which is different
from the Gaussian. Moreover, the probability that a detection is false depends
on the number of peaks present in the filtered GRF, the greater the number of
peaks in a GRF, the higher the probability of peaks due to the noise that
exceed the detection threshold. If not taken into account, the PFA can be
severely underestimated. Many solutions proposed to this problem are
non-parametric hence not able to exploit all the available information. This
limitation has been overcome by means of two efficient parametric approaches,
one based on the PDF of the peak amplitudes of a smooth and isotropic GRF
whereas the other uses the Gumbel distribution (the asymptotic PDF of the
corresponding extreme). Simulations and ALMA maps show that, although the two
methods produce almost identical results, the first is more flexible and allows
us to check the reliability of the detection procedure.

Title:A transition from parabolic to conical shape as a common effect in nearby AGN jets,"
Abstract:  Observational studies of collimation in jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN)
are a key to understanding their formation and acceleration processes. We have
performed an automated search for jet shape transitions in a sample of 367 AGN
using VLBA data at 15 GHz and 1.4 GHz. This search has found ten out of 29
nearby jets at redshifts z<0.07 with a transition from a parabolic to conical
shape, while the full analyzed sample is dominated by distant AGN with a
typical z about 1. The ten AGN are UGC00773, NGC1052, 3C111, 3C120,
TXS0815-094, Mrk180, PKS1514+00, NGC6251, 3C371, and BL Lac. We conclude that
the geometry transition may be a common effect in AGN jets. It can be observed
only when sufficient linear resolution is obtained. Supplementing these results
with previously reported shape breaks in the nearby AGN 1H0323+342 and M87, we
estimate that the break occurs at 10^5-10^6 gravitational radii from the
nucleus. We suggest that the jet shape transition happens when the bulk plasma
kinetic energy flux becomes equal to the Poynting energy flux, while the
ambient medium pressure is assumed to be governed by Bondi accretion. In
general, the break point may not coincide with the Bondi radius. The
observational data supports our model predictions on the jet acceleration and
properties of the break point.

Title:Cosmology and dark energy from joint gravitational wave-GRB observations,"
Abstract:  Gravitational-wave (GW) detectors can contribute to the measurement of
cosmological parameters and to testing the dark-energy sector of alternatives
to $\Lambda$CDM, by using standard sirens. In this paper we focus on binary
neutron stars with a counterpart detected through a gamma-ray burst (GRB), both
at a second-generation network made by advanced LIGO+advanced Virgo+LIGO
India+Kagra, and at third-generation (3G) detectors, discussing in particular
the cases of a single Einstein Telescope (ET), and of a network of ET plus two
Cosmic Explorer (CE). We construct mock catalogs of standard sirens, using
different scenarios for the local merger rate and for the detection of the
electromagnetic counterpart. For 3G detectors we estimate the coincidences with
a GRB detector with the characteristics of the proposed THESEUS mission. We
discuss how these standard sirens with a GRB counterpart can improve the
determination of cosmological parameters (and particularly of $H_0$) in
$\Lambda$CDM, and we then study how to extract information on dark energy,
considering both a non-trivial dark energy equation of state and modified GW
propagation. We find that a 2G detector network can already reach, over several
years of data taking, an interesting sensitivity to modified GW propagation,
while a single ET detector would have a remarkable potential for discovery. We
also find that, to fully exploit the potential of a ET+CE+CE network, it is
necessary a much stronger program of search for electromagnetic counterparts
(or else to resort to statistical methods for standard sirens), and furthermore
gravitational lensing can become a limiting factor.

Title:A fast radio burst localised to a massive galaxy,"
Abstract:  Intense, millisecond-duration bursts of radio waves have been detected from
beyond the Milky Way [1]. Their extragalactic origins are evidenced by their
large dispersion measures, which are greater than expected for propagation
through the Milky Way interstellar medium alone, and imply contributions from
the intergalactic medium and potentially host galaxies [2]. Although several
theories exist for the sources of these fast radio bursts, their intensities,
durations and temporal structures suggest coherent emission from highly
magnetised plasma [3,4]. Two sources have been observed to repeat [5,6], and
one repeater (FRB 121102) has been localised to the largest star-forming region
of a dwarf galaxy at a cosmological redshift of 0.19 [7, 8]. However, the host
galaxies and distances of the so far non-repeating fast radio bursts are yet to
be identified. Unlike repeating sources, these events must be observed with an
interferometer with sufficient spatial resolution for arcsecond localisation at
the time of discovery. Here we report the localisation of a fast radio burst
(FRB 190523) to a few-arcsecond region containing a single massive galaxy at a
redshift of 0.66. This galaxy is in stark contrast to the host of FRB 121102,
being a thousand times more massive, with a greater than hundred times lower
specific star-formation rate. The properties of this galaxy highlight the
possibility of a channel for FRB production associated with older stellar
populations.

Title:An order-disorder phase transition in black-hole star clusters,"
Abstract:  The centers of most galaxies contain massive black holes surrounded by dense
star clusters. The structure of these clusters determines the rate and
properties of observable transient events, such as flares from tidally
disrupted stars and gravitational-wave signals from stars spiraling into the
black hole. Most estimates of these rates enforce spherical symmetry on the
cluster. Here we show that, in the course of generic evolutionary processes, a
star cluster surrounding a black hole can undergo a robust phase transition
from a spherical thermal equilibrium to a lopsided equilibrium, in which most
stars are on high-eccentricity orbits with aligned orientations. The rate of
transient events is expected to be much higher in the ordered phase. Better
models of cluster formation and evolution are needed to determine whether
clusters should be found in the ordered or disordered phase.

Title:Neutron star mergers and rare core-collapse supernovae as sources of r-process enrichment in simulated galaxies,"
Abstract:  We use cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-mass
galaxies from the Auriga project to study their enrichment with rapid neutron
capture (r-process) elements. We implement a variety of enrichment models from
both binary neutron star mergers and rare core-collapse supernovae. We focus on
the abundances of (extremely) metal-poor stars, most of which were formed
during the first ~Gyr of the Universe in external galaxies and later accreted
onto the main galaxy. We find that the majority of metal-poor stars are
r-process enriched in all our enrichment models. Neutron star merger models
result in a median r-process abundance ratio which increases with metallicity,
whereas the median trend in rare core-collapse supernova models is
approximately flat. The scatter in r-process abundance increases for models
with longer delay times or lower rates of r-process producing events. Our
results are nearly perfectly converged, in part due to the mixing of gas
between mesh cells in the simulations. Additionally, different Milky Way-mass
galaxies show only small variation in their respective r-process abundance
ratios. Current (sparse and potentially biased) observations of metal-poor
stars in the Milky Way seem to prefer rare core-collapse supernovae over
neutron star mergers as the dominant source of r-process elements at low
metallicity, but we discuss possible caveats to our models. Dwarf galaxies
which experience a single r-process event early in their history show highly
enhanced r-process abundances at low metallicity, which is seen both in
observations and in our simulations. We also find that the elements produced in
a single event are mixed with ~10^8 Msun of gas relatively quickly,
distributing the r-process elements over a large region.

Title:Observational Properties of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in the Field: Field-UDGs are Predominantly Blue and Starforming,"
Abstract:  While we have learned much about Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) in groups and
clusters, relatively little is known about them in less-dense environments.
More isolated UDGs are important for our understanding of UDG formation
scenarios because they form via secular mechanisms, allowing us to determine
the relative importance of environmentally-driven formation in groups and
clusters. We have used the public Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) together with the
Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) to constrain the abundance
and properties of UDGs in the field, targeting sources with low surface
brightness (24.0$\leq$\bar{\mu}_{e,r}}$\leq$\26.5) and large apparent sizes
(3.0\arcsec$\leq$\bar{r}_{e,r}}$\leq$8.0\arcsec). Accounting for several
sources of interlopers in our selection based on canonical scaling relations,
and using an empirical UDG model based on measurements from the literature, we
show that a scenario in which cluster-like red sequence UDGs occupy a
significant number of field galaxies is unlikely, with most field UDGs being
significantly bluer and showing signs of localised star formation. An immediate
conclusion is that UDGs are much more efficiently quenched in high-density
environments. We estimate an upper-limit on the total field abundance of UDGs
of 8$\pm$3$\times10^{-3}$cMpc$^{-3}$ within our selection range. We also
compare the total field abundance of UDGs to a measurement of the abundance of
HI-rich UDGs from the literature, suggesting that they occupy at least
one-fifth of the overall UDG population. The mass formation efficiency of UDGs
implied by this upper-limit is similar to what is measured in groups and
clusters.

Title:The Fundamental Relation between Halo Mass and Galaxy Group Properties,"
Abstract:  We explore the interrelationships between the galaxy group halo mass and
various observable group properties. We propose a simple scenario that
describes the evolution of the central galaxies and their host dark matter
halos. Star formation quenching is one key process in this scenario, which
leads to the different assembly histories of blue groups (group with a blue
central) and red groups (group with a red central). For blue groups, both the
central galaxy and the halo continue to grow their mass. For red groups, the
central galaxy has been quenched and its stellar mass remains about constant,
while its halo continues to grow by merging smaller halos. From this simple
scenario, we speculate about the driving properties that should strongly
correlate with the group halo mass. We then apply the machine learning
algorithm the Random Forest (RF) regressor to blue groups and red groups
separately in the semianalytical model L-GALAXIES to explore these nonlinear
multicorrelations and to verify the scenario as proposed above. Remarkably, the
results given by the RF regressor are fully consistent with the prediction from
our simple scenario and hence provide strong support for it. As a consequence,
the group halo mass can be more accurately determined from observable galaxy
properties by the RF regressor with a 50% reduction in error. A halo mass more
accurately determined in this way also enables more accurate investigations on
the galaxy-halo connection and other important related issues, including
galactic conformity and the effect of halo assembly bias on galaxy assembly.

Title:The Dependence of AGN Activity on Environment in SDSS,"
Abstract:  Environment is one of the key external drivers of the galaxies, while active
galactic nucleus (AGN) is one of the key internal drivers. Both of them play
fundamental roles in regulating the formation and evolution of galaxies. We
explore the interrelationship between environment and AGN in SDSS. At a given
stellar mass, the specific star formation rate distribution of the AGN host
galaxies remains unchanged with over-density, with the peak of the distribution
around the Green Valley. We show that, at a given stellar mass, the AGN
fraction that has been commonly used in previous studies (defined as the number
of AGNs relative to all galaxies including passive and star forming ones) does
decrease with increasing over-density for satellites. This is largely due to
the fact that the fraction of passive galaxies strongly depends on environment.
In order to investigate the intrinsic correlation between AGN and environment,
especially under the assumption that AGN feedback is responsible for star
formation quenching, the AGN fraction should be defined as the number of AGNs
relative to the star-forming galaxies only. With the new definition, we find
little dependence of AGN fraction on over-density, central/satellite, and group
halo mass. There is only marginal evidence that AGN may prefer denser regions,
which is possibly due to more frequent interaction of galaxies or higher merger
rate in groups. Our results support the scenario that internal secular
evolution is the predominant mechanism of triggering AGN activity, while
external environment related processes only play a minor role.

Title:The radial acceleration relation and dark baryons in MOND,"
Abstract:  Recent observations of rotationally supported galaxies show a tight
correlation between the observed radial acceleration at every radius and the
Newtonian acceleration generated by the baryonic mass distribution, the
so-called radial acceleration relation (RAR). The rotation curves (RCs) of the
SPARC sample of disk galaxies with different morphologies, masses, sizes and
gas fractions are investigated in the context of modified Newtonian dynamics
(MOND). We include the effect of cold dark baryons by scaling the measured mass
in the atomic form by a factor of $c$ in the mass budget of galaxies. In
addition to the standard interpolating function, we also fit the RCs and the
RAR with the empirical RAR-inspired interpolating function. Slightly better
fits for about $47\%$ of galaxies in our sample are achieved in the presence of
dark baryons ($c>1$) with the mean value of $c = 2.4\pm 1.3$. Although the MOND
fits are not significantly improved by including dark baryons, it results in a
decrease in the characteristic acceleration $g_$ by $40\%$. We find no
correlation between the MOND critical acceleration $a_0$ and the central
surface brightness of the stellar disk, $\mu_{3.6}$. This supports $a_0$ being
a universal constant for all galaxies.

Title:Bayesian hierarchical inference of asteroseismic inclination angles,"
Abstract:  The stellar inclination angle-the angle between the rotation axis of a star
and our line of sight-provides valuable information in many different areas,
from the characterisation of the geometry of exoplanetary and eclipsing binary
systems, to the formation and evolution of those systems. We propose a method
based on asteroseismology and a Bayesian hierarchical scheme for extracting the
inclination angle of a single star. This hierarchical method therefore provides
a means to both accurately and robustly extract inclination angles from red
giant stars. We successfully apply this technique to an artificial dataset with
an underlying isotropic inclination angle distribution to verify the method. We
also apply this technique to 123 red giant stars observed with
$\textit{Kepler}$. We also show the need for a selection function to account
for possible population-level biases, that are not present in individual
star-by-star cases, in order to extend the hierarchical method towards
inferring underlying population inclination angle distributions.

non-contiguous fields at high Galactic latitudes (8000 deg^2 at |b| > 30 deg)
and two areas of the Galactic plane and bulge (for an additional 1300 deg^2).
S-PLUS uses the Javalambre 12-band magnitude system, which includes the 5 u, g,
r, i, z broad-band filters and 7 narrow-band filters centered on prominent
stellar spectral features: the Balmer jump/[OII], Ca H+K, H-delta, G-band, Mg b
triplet, H-alpha, and the Ca triplet. S-PLUS delivers accurate photometric
redshifts (delta_z/(1+z) = 0.02 or better) for galaxies with r < 20 AB mag and
redshift < 0.5, thus producing a 3D map of the local Universe over a volume of
more than 1 (Gpc/h)^3. The final S-PLUS catalogue will also enable the study of
star formation and stellar populations in and around the Milky Way and nearby
galaxies, as well as searches for quasars, variable sources, and
low-metallicity stars. In this paper we introduce the main characteristics of
the survey, illustrated with science verification data highlighting the unique
capabilities of S-PLUS. We also present the first public data release of ~336

Title:A new weak-field magnetic DA white dwarf in the local 20 pc volume. The frequency of magnetic fields in DA stars,"
Abstract:  We report the discovery of a new magnetic DA white dwarf (WD), WD0011-721,
which is located within the very important 20pc volume-limited sample of the
closest WDs to the Sun. This star has a mean field modulus <|B|> of 343 kG, and
from the polarisation signal we deduce a line-of-sight field component of 75
kG. The magnetic field is sufficiently weak to have escaped detection in
classification spectra. We then present a preliminary exploration of the data
concerning the frequency of such fields among WDs with hydrogen-rich
atmospheres (DA stars). We find that 20 +- 5% of the DA WDs in this volume have
magnetic fields, mostly weaker than 1 MG. Unlike the slow field decay found
among the magnetic Bp stars of the upper main sequence, the WDs in this sample
show no evidence of magnetic field or flux changes over several Gyr.

Title:HSC16aayt: Slowly evolving interacting transient rising for more than 100 days,"
Abstract:  We report our observations of HSC16aayt (SN 2016jiu), which was discovered by
the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) transient survey conducted as part of Subaru
Strategic Program (SSP). It shows very slow photometric evolution and its rise
time is more than 100 days. The optical magnitude change in 400 days remains
within 0.6 mag. Spectra of HSC16aayt show a strong narrow emission line and we
classify it as a Type IIn supernova. The redshift of HSC16aayt is 0.6814 +/-
0.0002 from the spectra. Its host galaxy center is at 5 kpc from the supernova
location and HSC16aayt might be another example of isolated Type IIn
supernovae, although the possible existence of underlying star forming activity
of the host galaxy at the supernova location is not excluded.

"Title:Astro2020 APC White Paper: The Early Career Perspective on the Coming Decade, Astrophysics Career Paths, and the Decadal Survey Process","
Abstract:  In response to the need for the Astro2020 Decadal Survey to explicitly engage
early career astronomers, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine hosted the Early Career Astronomer and Astrophysicist Focus Session
(ECFS) on October 8-9, 2018 under the auspices of Committee of Astronomy and
Astrophysics. The meeting was attended by fifty six pre-tenure faculty,
research scientists, postdoctoral scholars, and senior graduate students, as
well as eight former decadal survey committee members, who acted as
facilitators. The event was designed to educate early career astronomers about
the decadal survey process, to solicit their feedback on the role that early
career astronomers should play in Astro2020, and to provide a forum for the
discussion of a wide range of topics regarding the astrophysics career path.
This white paper presents highlights and themes that emerged during two days
of discussion. In Section 1, we discuss concerns that emerged regarding the
coming decade and the astrophysics career path, as well as specific
recommendations from participants regarding how to address them. We have
organized these concerns and suggestions into five broad themes. These include
(sequentially): (1) adequately training astronomers in the statistical and
computational techniques necessary in an era of ""big data"", (2) responses to
the growth of collaborations and telescopes, (3) concerns about the adequacy of
graduate and postdoctoral training, (4) the need for improvements in equity and
inclusion in astronomy, and (5) smoothing and facilitating transitions between
early career stages. Section 2 is focused on ideas regarding the decadal survey
itself, including: incorporating early career voices, ensuring diverse input
from a variety of stakeholders, and successfully and broadly disseminating the
results of the survey.

Title:Constraining the inner density slope of massive galaxy clusters,"
Abstract:  We determine the inner density profiles of massive galaxy clusters (M$_{200}$
> $5 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) in the Cluster-EAGLE (C-EAGLE) hydrodynamic
simulations, and investigate whether the dark matter density profiles can be
correctly estimated from a combination of mock stellar kinematical and
gravitational lensing data. From fitting mock stellar kinematics and lensing
data generated from the simulations, we find that the inner density slopes of
both the total and the dark matter mass distributions can be inferred
reasonably well. We compare the density slopes of C-EAGLE clusters with those
derived by Newman et al. for 7 massive galaxy clusters in the local Universe.
We find that the asymptotic best-fit inner slopes of ""generalized"" NFW (gNFW)
profiles, ${\gamma}_{\rm gNFW}$, of the dark matter haloes of the C-EAGLE
clusters are significantly steeper than those inferred by Newman et al.
However, the mean mass-weighted dark matter density slopes of the simulated
clusters are in good agreement with the Newman et al. estimates. We also find
that the estimate of ${\gamma}_{\rm gNFW}$ is very sensitive to the constraints
from weak lensing measurements in the outer parts of the cluster and a bias can
lead to an underestimate of ${\gamma}_{\rm gNFW}$.

Title:The relation between the turbulent Mach number and observed fractal dimensions of turbulent clouds,"
Abstract:  Supersonic turbulence is a key player in controlling the structure and star
formation potential of molecular clouds (MCs). The three-dimensional (3D)
turbulent Mach number, $\mathcal{M}$, allows us to predict the rate of star
formation. However, determining Mach numbers in observations is challenging
because it requires accurate measurements of the velocity dispersion. Moreover,
observations are limited to two-dimensional (2D) projections of the MCs and
velocity information can usually only be obtained for the line-of-sight
component. Here we present a new method that allows us to estimate
$\mathcal{M}$ from the 2D column density, $\Sigma$, by analysing the fractal
dimension, $\mathcal{D}$. We do this by computing $\mathcal{D}$ for six
simulations, ranging between $1$ and $100$ in $\mathcal{M}$. From this data we
are able to construct an empirical relation, $\log\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{D}) =
\xi_1(\text{erfc}^{-1} [(\mathcal{D}-\mathcal{D}_{\text{min}})/\Omega] +
\xi_2),$ where $\text{erfc}^{-1}$ is the inverse complimentary error function,
$\mathcal{D}_{\text{min}} = 1.55 \pm 0.13$ is the minimum fractal dimension of
$\Sigma$, $\Omega = 0.22 \pm 0.07$, $\xi_1 = 0.9 \pm 0.1$ and $\xi_2 = 0.2 \pm
0.2$. We test the accuracy of this new relation on column density maps from
$Herschel$ observations of two quiescent subregions in the Polaris Flare MC,
`saxophone' and `quiet'. We measure $\mathcal{M} \sim 10$ and $\mathcal{M} \sim
2$ for the subregions, respectively, which is similar to previous estimates
based on measuring the velocity dispersion from molecular line data. These
results show that this new empirical relation can provide useful estimates of
the cloud kinematics, solely based upon the geometry from the column density of
the cloud.

Title:Fragmented Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3,"
Abstract:  Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 has been observed to fragment on several
occasions, yet the cause of its fragmentation remains poorly understood. We use
previously unpublished archival Hubble Space Telescope data taken in 2006 to
study the properties of the primary fragment, 73P-C, in order to constrain the
potential fragmentation mechanisms. Currently the literature presents a wide
range of measured rotational periods, some of which suggest that the nucleus
might have split due to rotational instability. However, we find the most
likely value of the rotation period to be 10.38 $\pm$ 0.04 hours (20.76 $\pm$
0.08 hours if double-peaked), much longer than the critical period for
rotational instability for any reasonable nucleus density and shape, even in
the absence of tensile strength. We also find strong, cyclic photometric
variations of about 0.31 $\pm$ 0.01 magnitudes in the central light from this
object, while similar variations with a smaller range are apparent in the
surrounding dust coma. These observations are compatible with rotational
modulation of the mass loss rate and with dust having a mean outflow speed of
$107 \pm 9$ m s$^{-1}$. Finally, we also estimate the radius of the nucleus to
be 0.4 $\pm$ 0.1 km accounting for dust contamination and assuming a geometric
albedo of 0.04.

"Title:OGLE-2018-BLG-1011L\lowercase{b,c}: Microlensing Planetary System with Two Giant Planets Orbiting a Low-mass Star","
Abstract:  We report a multiplanetary system found from the analysis of microlensing
event OGLE-2018-BLG-1011, for which the light curve exhibits a double-bump
anomaly around the peak. We find that the anomaly cannot be fully explained by
the binary-lens or binary-source interpretations and its description requires
the introduction of an additional lens component. The 3L1S (3 lens components
and a single source) modeling yields three sets of solutions, in which one set
of solutions indicates that the lens is a planetary system in a binary, while
the other two sets imply that the lens is a multiplanetary system. By
investigating the fits of the individual models to the detailed light curve
structure, we find that the multiple-planet solution with planet-to-host mass
ratios $\sim 9.5\times 10^{-3}$ and $\sim 15\times 10^{-3}$ are favored over
the other solutions. From the Bayesian analysis, we find that the lens is
composed of two planets with masses $1.8^{+3..4}_{-1.1}~M_{\rm J}$ and
$2.8^{+5.1}_{-1.7}~M_{\rm J}$ around a host with a mass
$0.18^{+0.33}_{-0.10}~M_\odot$ and located at a distance
$7.1^{+1.1}_{-1.5}~{\rm kpc}$. The estimated distance indicates that the lens
is the farthest system among the known multiplanetary systems. The projected
planet-host separations are $a_{\perp,2}=1.8^{+2.1}_{-1.5}~{\rm au}$
($0.8^{+0.9}_{-0.6}~{\rm au}$) and $a_{\perp,3}=0.8^{+0.9}_{-0.6}~{\rm au}$,
where the values of $a_{\perp,2}$ in and out the parenthesis are the
separations corresponding to the two degenerate solutions, indicating that both
planets are located beyond the snow line of the host, as with the other four
multiplanetary systems previously found by microlensing.

Title:Some things special about NEAs: Geometric and environmental effects on the optical signatures of hydration,"
Abstract:  Here were report on a laboratory study aiming to reproduce specificities of
near-Earth Asteroid. We study how the elevated surface temperature, their
surface roughness (rock or regolith), as well as observation geometry can
affect the absorption features detected on asteroids. For that purpose, we
selected a recent carbonaceous chondrite fall, the Mukundpura CM2 chondrite
which fell in India in June 2017. Bidirectional reflectance spectroscopy was
performed to analyze the effect of the geometrical configuration (incidence,
emergence and azimuth angle) on the measurement. Our results show that
reflectance spectra obtained under warm environment (NEA-like) tends to show
shallower absorption bands compared to low-temperature conditions (MBA-like),
but still detectable in our experiments under laboratory timescales.
Irreversible alteration of the sample because of the warm environment (from
room temperature to 250C) has been detected as an increase of the
spectral slope and a decrease of the band depths (at 0.7{\mu}m, 0.9{\mu}m and
2.7{\mu}m). Comparing the meteoritic chip and the powdered sample, we found
that surface texture strongly affects the shape of the reflectance spectra of
meteorites and thus of asteroids, where a dust-covered surface presents deeper
absorption features. We found that all spectral parameters, such as the
reflectance value, spectral slope and possible absorption bands are affected by
the geometry of measurement. We observed the disappearance of the 0.7 {\mu}m
absorption feature at phase angle larger than 120, but the 3{\mu}m band
remains detectable on all measured spectra.

Title:Reduced Order Estimation of the Speckle Electric Field History for Space-Based Coronagraphs,"
Abstract:  In high-contrast space-based coronagraphs, one of the main limiting factors
for imaging the dimmest exoplanets is the time varying nature of the residual
starlight (speckles). Modern methods try to differentiate between the
intensities of starlight and other sources, but none incorporate models of
space-based systems which can take into account actuations of the deformable
mirrors. Instead, we propose formulating the estimation problem in terms of the
electric field while allowing for dithering of the deformable mirrors. Our
reduced-order approach is similar to intensity-based PCA (e.g. KLIP) although,
under certain assumptions, it requires a considerably lower number of modes of
the electric field. We illustrate this by a FALCO simulation of the WFIRST
hybrid Lyot coronagraph.

Title:Investigations on MultiView VLBI for SKA,"
Abstract:  The SKA will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity, but most
astrometric VLBI observations are limited by systematic errors. In these cases
improved sensitivity offers no benefit. The best current solution for improving
the accuracy of the VLBI calibration is \MV\ VLBI, where multiple simultaneous
observations around the target are used to deduce the corrections required for
the line of sight to the target. We have estimated and quantified the
applicability of \MV\ from real-world ionospheric studies, making projections
into achievable astrometric accuracies. These predict systematic measurement
errors, with calibrators separated by several degrees, of $\sim$10\uas\ with
current VLBI facilities. For closer calibrators, that are in-beam for single
dish VLBI facilities, we predict systematic measurement errors of a few \uas.
This is the ideal combination, where the sensitivity of the SKA will provide
the precision and \MV\ will provide the accuracy. Based on these results we
suggest that the SKA design should increase the number of VLBI beams it can
form from four to as many as ten.

Title:Modelling the post-reionization neutral hydrogen (${\rm HI}$) 21-cm bispectrum,"
Abstract:  Measurements of the post-reionization 21-cm bispectrum $B_{\rm
HI}(\mathbf{k_1},\mathbf{k_2},\mathbf{k_3})$ using various upcoming intensity
mapping experiments hold the potential for determining the cosmological
parameters at a high level of precision. In this paper we have estimated the
21-cm bispectrum in the $z$ range $1 \le z \le 6$ using semi-numerical
simulations of the neutral hydrogen (${\rm HI}$) distribution. We determine the
$k$ and $z$ range where the 21-cm bispectrum can be adequately modelled using
the predictions of second order perturbation theory, and we use this to predict
the redshift evolution of the linear and quadratic ${\rm HI}$ bias parameters
$b_1$ and $b_2$ respectively. The $b_1$ values are found to decreases nearly
linearly with decreasing $z$, and are in good agreement with earlier
predictions obtained by modelling the 21-cm power spectrum $P_{\rm HI}(k)$.
The $b_2$ values fall sharply with decreasing $z$, becomes zero at $z \sim 3$
and attains a nearly constant value $b_2 \approx - 0.36$ at $z<2$. We provide
polynomial fitting formulas for $b_1$ and $b_2$ as functions of $z$. The
modelling presented here is expected to be useful in future efforts to
determine cosmological parameters and constrain primordial non-Gaussianity
using the 21-cm bispectrum.

Title:How well do we understand the belt/zone circulation of Giant Planet atmospheres?,"
Abstract:  The atmospheres of the four giant planets of our Solar System share a common
and well-observed characteristic: they each display patterns of planetary
banding, with regions of different temperatures, composition, aerosol
properties and dynamics separated by strong meridional and vertical gradients
in the zonal (i.e., east-west) winds. On Jupiter, the reflective white bands of
low temperatures, elevated aerosol opacities, and enhancements of
quasi-conserved chemical tracers are referred to as 'zones.' Conversely, the
darker bands of warmer temperatures, depleted aerosols, and reductions of
chemical tracers are known as `belts.' On Saturn, we define cyclonic belts and
anticyclonic zones via their temperature and wind characteristics, although
their relation to Saturn's albedo is not as clear as on Jupiter. On distant
Uranus and Neptune, the exact relationships between the banded albedo contrasts
and the environmental properties is a topic of active study. This review is an
attempt to reconcile the observed properties of belts and zones with (i) the
meridional overturning inferred from the convergence of eddy angular momentum
into the eastward zonal jets at the cloud level on Jupiter and Saturn and the
prevalence of moist convective activity in belts; and (ii) the opposing
meridional motions inferred from the upper tropospheric temperature structure,
which implies decay and dissipation of the zonal jets with altitude above the
clouds. These two scenarios suggest meridional circulations in opposing
directions, the former suggesting upwelling in belts, the latter suggesting
upwelling in zones. This presents an unresolved paradox for our current
understanding of the banded structure of giant planet atmospheres, that could
be addressed via a multi-tiered vertical structure of 'stacked circulation
cells.' [Abridged]

Title:Time variations of H2O and SiO masers in the proto-Planeatry Nebula OH231.8+4.2,"
Abstract:  H2O (22 GHz) and SiO masers (43, 86, 129 GHz) in the bipolar proto-planetary
nebula OH231.8+4.2 were simultaneously monitored using the 21-m antennas of the
Korean VLBI Network in 2009-2015. Both species exhibit periodic flux variations
that correlate with the central star's optical light curve, with a phase delay
of up to 0.15 for the maser flux variations with respect to the optical light
curve. The flux densities of SiO v = 2, J = 1-0 and H2O masers decrease with
time, implying that they may disappear in 10-20 years. However, there seems to
have been a transient episode of intense H2O maser emission around 2010. We
also found a systematic behaviour in the velocity profiles of these masers. The
velocities of the H2O maser components appear to be remarkably constant,
suggesting ballistic motion for the bipolar outflow in this nebula. On the
other hand, those of the SiO maser clumps show a systematic radial acceleration
of the individual clumps, converging to the outflow velocity of the H2O maser
clumps. Measuring the full widths at zero power of the detected lines, we
estimated the expansion velocities of the compact bipolar outflow traced by H2O
maser and SiO thermal line, and discussed the possibility of the expanding SiO
maser region in the equatorial direction. All of our analyses support that the
central host star of OH231.8 is close to the tip of the AGB phase, and that the
mass-loss rate recently started to decrease because of incipient post-AGB
evolution.

numbers of MBHB mergers. We find that: (i) among the three MBHB models, the
Q3nod model can provide the tightest constraints on the cosmological
parameters; (ii) TianQin's standard siren observation can effectively break the
parameter degeneracies inherent in the cosmic microwave background observation;
and (iii) the future standard siren observation from TianQin can significantly

Abstract:  We examine the the emission from optically bright gamma-ray burst (GRB)
afterglows as the Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) on the Neil Gehrels
Swift Observatory first begins observing, following the slew to target the GRB,
while the pointing of the Swift satellite is still settling. We verify the
photometric quality of the UVOT settling data using bright stars in the field
of view. In the majority of cases we find no problems with the settling
exposure photometry, but in one case we excise the first second of the exposure
to mitigate a spacecraft attitude reconstruction issue, and in a second case we
exclude the first second of the exposure in which the UVOT photocathode voltage
appears to be ramping up. Of a sample of 23 afterglows which have peak V
magnitudes <16, we find that all are detected in the settling exposures, when
Swift arrives on target. For 9 of the GRBs the UVOT settling exposure took
place before the conclusion of the prompt gamma-ray emission. Five of these
GRBs have well defined optical peaks after the settling exposures, with rises
of >0.5 mag in their optical lightcurves, and there is a marginal trend for
these GRBs to have long T90. Such a trend is expected for thick-shell
afterglows, but the temporal indices of the optical rises and the timing of the
optical peaks appear to rule out thick shells.

Title:Envelopes of embedded super-Earths I. Two-dimensional simulations,"
Abstract:  Measurements of exoplanetary masses and radii have revealed a population of
massive super-Earths --- planets sufficiently large that, according to one
dimensional models, they should have turned into gas giants. To better
understand the origin of these objects, we carry out hydrodynamical simulations
of planetary cores embedded in a nascent protoplanetary disk. In this first
paper of a series, to gain intuition as well as to develop useful diagnostics,
we focus on two-dimensional simulations of the flow around protoplanetary
cores. We use the pluto code to study isothermal and adiabatic envelopes around
cores of sub- to super-thermal masses, fully resolving the envelope properties
down to the core surface. Owing to the conservation of vortensity, envelopes
acquire a substantial degree of rotational support when the core mass increases
beyond the thermal mass, suggesting a limited applicability of one-dimensional
models for describing the envelope structure. The finite size of the core
(relatively large for super-Earths) also controls the amount of rotational
support in the entire envelope. Steady non-axisymmetric shocks develop in the
supersonic envelopes of high-mass cores, triggering mass accretion and
turbulent mixing in their interiors. We also examine the influence of the gas
self-gravity on the envelope structure. Although it only weakly alters the
properties of the envelopes, the gas gravity has significant effect on the
properties of the density waves triggered by the core in the protoplanetary
disk.

Abstract:  The bulge represents the best compromise between old and massive Galactic
component, and as such its study is a valuable opportunity to understand how
the bulk of the Milky Way formed and evolved. In addition, being the only bulge
in which we can individually resolve stars in all evolutionary sequences, the
properties of its stellar content provide crucial insights on the formation of
bulges at large. We aim at providing a detailed and comprehensive census of the
Milky Way bulge stellar populations by producing deep and accurate photometric
catalogs of the inner ~300 sqdeg of the Galaxy. We perform DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME
PSF-fitting photometry of multi-epochs J and Ks images provided by the VVV
survey to obtain deep photometric catalogs. Artificial star experiments have
been conducted on all images to properly assess the completeness and the
accuracy of the photometric measurements. We present a photometric database
containing nearly 600 million stars across the bulge area surveyed by the VVV.
Through the comparison of derived color-magnitude diagrams of selected fields
representative of different levels of extinction and crowding, we show the
quality, completeness and depth of the new catalogs. With the exception of the
fields located along the plane, this new photometry samples stars down to ~1-2
mag below the MS-TO with unprecedented accuracy. To demonstrate the tremendous
potential inherent to this new dataset, we give few examples of possible
applications such as: i) star counts studies through the dataset completeness
map; ii) surface brightness map; and iii) cross-correlation with Gaia DR2. The
database presented here represents an invaluable collection for the whole

Title:The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Science case and survey design,"
Abstract:  The Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) is a synoptic, all-sky radio sky
survey with a unique combination of high angular resolution ($\approx$2.5""),
sensitivity (a 1$\sigma$ goal of 70 $\mu$Jy/beam in the coadded data), full
linear Stokes polarimetry, time domain coverage, and wide bandwidth (2-4 GHz).
The first observations began in September 2017, and observing for the survey
will finish in 2024. VLASS will use approximately 5500 hours of time on the
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to cover the whole sky visible to the VLA
(Declination $>-40^{\circ}$), a total of 33,885 deg$^2$. The data will be taken
in three epochs to allow the discovery of variable and transient radio sources.
The survey is designed to engage radio astronomy experts, multi-wavelength

Title:Exploring the origin of multiwavelength activities of high-redshift FSRQ PKS 1502+106 during 2014-2018,"
Abstract:  The origin of the multi-band activities (outbursts/flares) of blazars is
still a heavily debated topic. Shock and magnetic reconnection have long been
considered as possible triggers for the multi-band activities. In this paper,
we present an exploration of the origin of multi-band activities for a
high-redshift (z =1.8385) FSRQ PKS 1502+106. Utilizing multi-band data from
radio to $\gamma$-ray and optical polarization observations, we investigate two
dramatic activities in detail: a $\gamma$-ray dominated outburst in 2015 and an
optical dominated outburst in 2017. Our main results are as follows. (I) A fast
$\gamma$-ray flare with a flux-doubling time-scale as short as 1-hr in 2015 is
discovered. Based on the variability time-scale, the physical parameters of the
flaring region (e.g, minimum Doppler factor, emission region size, etc.) are
constrained. At the peak of the flare, the $\gamma$-ray spectrum hardens to
$\Gamma_{\gamma} = 1.82\pm0.04$ and exhibits an obvious curvature/break
characteristic that is caused by the typical ""cooling break"". Modelings of
multi-band SEDs reveal a very hard electronic energy spectrum with the
electronic spectral index of $1.07\pm0.53$. This result suggests that this fast
$\gamma$-ray flare may be triggered by magnetic reconnection. (II) During the
outburst in 2017, the optical polarization degree and optical fluxes show a
very tight correlation. By analyzing Stokes parameters of polarization
observations, our results show that this outburst could be triggered by a
transverse shock with a compression ratio of $\eta> 2.2$, and the magnetic
field intensity of the shock emission region is about $0.032$ G.

Title:Conformable Fractional Polytropic Gas Spheres,"
Abstract:  Lane Emden differential equation of the polytropic gas sphere could be used
to construct simple models of stellar structures, star clusters and many
configurations in astrophysics. This differential equation suffers from the
singularity at the center and has an exact solution only for the polytropic
index n=0,1 and 5. In the present paper, we present an analytical solution to
the fractional polytropic gas sphere via accelerated series expansion. The
solution is performed in the frame of conformable fractional derivatives. The
calculated models recover the well-known series of solutions when \alpha=1.
Physical parameters such as mass-radius relation, density ratio, pressure ratio
and temperature ratio for different fractional models have been calculated and
investigated. We found that the present models of the conformable fractional
stars have smaller volume and mass than that of both the integer star and
fractional models performed in the frame of modified Rienmann Liouville
derivatives.

Title:The dwarf galaxy satellite system of Centaurus A,"
Abstract:  Dwarf galaxy satellite systems are essential probes to test models of
structure formation, making it necessary to establish a census of dwarf
galaxies outside of our own Local Group. We present deep FORS2 VI band images
from the ESO Very Large Telescope for 15 dwarf galaxy candidates in the
Centaurus group of galaxies. We confirm nine dwarfs to be members of CenA by
measuring their distances using a Bayesian approach to determine the tip of the
red giant branch luminosity. We have also fitted theoretical isochrones to
measure their mean metallicities. The properties of the new dwarfs are similar
to those in the Local Group in terms of their sizes, luminosities, and mean
metallicities. Within our photometric precision there is no evidence of a
metallicity spread, but we do observe possible extended star formation in
several galaxies, as evidenced by a population of asymptotic giant branch stars
brighter than the red giant branch tip. The new dwarfs do not show any signs of
tidal disruption. Together with the recently reported dwarf galaxies by the
complementary PISCeS survey, we study the luminosity function and 3D structure
of the group. By comparing the observed luminosity function to the
high-resolution cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG, we find agreement within
a 90% confidence interval. However, CenA seems to be missing its brightest
satellites and has an overabundance of the faintest dwarfs in comparison to its
simulated analogs. In terms of the overall 3D distribution of the observed
satellites, we find that the whole structure is flattened along the
line-of-sight, with an root-mean-square (rms) height of 130 kpc and a rms semi
major axis length of 330 kpc. Future distance measurements of the remaining
dwarf galaxy candidates are needed to complete the census of dwarf galaxies in
the Centaurus group.

Title:The peculiar acceleration of stellar-origin black hole binaries: measurement and biases with LISA,"
Abstract:  We investigate the ability of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)
to measure the center of mass acceleration of stellar-origin black hole
binaries emitting gravitational waves. Our analysis is based on the idea that
the acceleration of the center of mass induces a time variation in the redshift
of the gravitational wave, which in turn modifies its waveform. We confirm that
while the cosmological acceleration is too small to leave a detectable imprint
on the gravitational waveforms observable by LISA, larger peculiar
accelerations may be measurable for sufficiently long lived sources. We focus
on stellar mass black hole binaries, which will be detectable at low
frequencies by LISA and near coalescence by ground based detectors. These
sources may have large peculiar accelerations, for instance, if they form in
nuclear star clusters or in AGN accretion disks. If that is the case, we find
that in an astrophysical population calibrated to the LIGO-Virgo observed
merger rate, LISA will be able to measure the peculiar acceleration of a small
but significant fraction of the events if the mission lifetime is extended
beyond the nominal duration of 4 years. In this scenario LISA will be able to
assess whether black hole binaries form close to galactic centers, particularly
in AGN disks, and will thus help discriminate between different formation
mechanisms. Although for a nominal 4 years LISA mission the peculiar
acceleration effect cannot be measured, a consistent fraction of events may be
biased by strong peculiar accelerations which, if present, may imprint large
systematic errors on some waveform parameters. In particular, estimates of the
luminosity distance could be strongly biased and consequently induce large
systematic errors on LISA measurements of the Hubble constant with stellar mass
black hole binaries.

Title:On the Gamma-Ray Nebula of Vela Pulsar. I. Very Slow Diffusion of Energetic Electrons within the TeV Nebula,"
Abstract:  High-energy particle transport in pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) plays an
essential role in explaining the characteristics revealed in multiwavelength
observations. In this paper, the TeV-gamma-ray-emitting electrons in the Vela X
PWN are approximated to be injected impulsively when the cocoon is formed due
to the interaction between the SNR reverse shock and the PWN. By solving the
diffusion-loss equation analytically, we reproduce the broadband spectral
energy distribution and surface brightness profile simultaneously. The
diffusion coefficient of TeV electrons and positrons, which is well constrained
by the spectral and spatial properties of the TeV nebula, is thus determined to
be $1 \times 10^{26}$\,cm$^{2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for 10\,TeV electrons and positrons.
This coefficient is more than three orders of magnitude lower than that in the
interstellar medium, in agreement with a constraint recently obtained from HAWC
observations of a TeV nebula associated with the Geminga pulsar. These results
suggest that slow diffusion of high-energy particles might be common in PWNe.

Title:On the Gamma-ray Nebula of Vela Pulsar. II. the Soft Spectrum of the Extended Radio Nebula,"
Abstract:  The Vela\,X pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is characterized by the extended radio
nebula (ERN) and the central X-ray ""cocoon"". We have interpreted the
$\gamma$-ray spectral properties of the cocoon in the sibling paper (Bao et
al.\,2019); here, we account for the broadband photon spectrum of the ERN.
Since the diffusive escape of the electrons from the TeV emitting region is
expected to play an insignificant role in shaping the spectrum of the ERN, we
attribute the GeV cutoff of the ERN to the reverse shock-PWN interaction. Due
to the disruption of the reverse shock, most of plasma of the PWN is driven
into the ERN. During the subsequent reverberation phase, the ERN could be
compressed by a large factor in radius, and the magnetic field in the ERN is
thus significantly enhanced, burning off the high energy electrons. We thus
obtain the electron spectrum of the ERN and the broadband spectrum of the ERN
are explained satisfactorily.

Title:Nonlocal gravity and gravitational-wave observations,"
Abstract:  We discuss a modified gravity model which fits cosmological observations at a
level statistically indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM and at the same time
predicts very large deviations from General Relativity (GR) in the propagation
of gravitational waves (GWs) across cosmological distances. The model is a
variant of the RT nonlocal model proposed and developed by our group, with
initial conditions set during inflation, and predicts a GW luminosity distance
that, at the redshifts accessible to LISA or to a third-generation GW detector
such as the Einstein Telescope (ET), can differ from that in GR by as much as
$60\%$. An effect of this size could be detected with just a single standard
siren with counterpart by LISA or ET. At the redshifts accessible to a
LIGO/Virgo/Kagra network at target sensitivity the effect is smaller but still
potentially detectable. Indeed, for the recently announced LIGO/Virgo NS-BH
candidate S190814bv, the RT model predicts that, given the measured GW
luminosity distance, the actual luminosity distance, and the redshift of an
electromagnetic counterpart, would be smaller by as much as $7\%$ with respect
to the value inferred from $\Lambda$CDM.

Title:Bias and robustness of eccentricity estimates from radial velocity data,"
Abstract:  Eccentricity is a parameter of particular interest as it is an informative
indicator of the past of planetary systems. It is however not always clear
whether the eccentricity fitted on radial velocity data is real or if it is an
artefact of an inappropriate modelling. In this work, we address this question
in two steps: we first assume that the model used for inference is correct and
present interesting features of classical estimators. Secondly, we study
whether the eccentricity estimates are to be trusted when the data contain
incorrectly modelled signals, such as missed planetary companions, non Gaussian
noises, correlated noises with unknown covariance, etc. Our main conclusion is
that data analysis via posterior distributions, with a model including a free
error term gives reliable results provided two conditions. First, convergence
of the numerical methods needs to be ascertained. Secondly, the noise power
spectrum should not have a particularly strong peak at the semi period of the
planet of interest. As a consequence, it is difficult to determine if the
signal of an apparently eccentric planet might be due to another inner
companion in 2:1 mean motion resonance. We study the use of Bayes factors to
disentangle these cases. Finally, we suggest methods to check if there are
hints of an incorrect model in the residuals. We show on simulated data the
performance of our methods and comment on the eccentricities of Proxima b and
55 Cnc f.

Title:Radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the evolution of the diffuse ionized gas in disc galaxies,"
Abstract:  There is strong evidence that the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in disc galaxies
is photoionized by radiation from UV luminous O and B stars in the galactic
disc, both from observations and detailed numerical models. However, it is
still not clear what mechanism is responsible for providing the necessary
pressure support for a diffuse gas layer at kpc-scale above the disc. In this
work we investigate if the pressure increase caused by photoionization can
provide this support. We run self-consistent radiation hydrodynamics models of
a gaseous disc in an external potential. We find that photoionization feedback
can drive low levels of turbulence in the dense galactic disc, and that it
provides pressure support for an extended diffuse gas layer. Our results show
that there is a natural fine-tuning between the total ionizing radiation budget
of the sources in the galaxy and the amount of gas in the different ionization
phases of the ISM, and provide the first fully consistent radiation
hydrodynamics model of the DIG.

Title:Chemical composition of the outer halo globular cluster Palomar 15,"
Abstract:  Globular clusters (GCs) in the outer Milky Way halo are important tracers of
the assembly history of our Galaxy. Only a few of these objects show spreads in
heavier elements beyond the canonical light-element variations that have
essentially been found throughout the entire Galactic GC system, suggesting a
more complex origin and evolution of these objects. Here, we present the first
abundance analysis of three red giants in the remote ($R_{\rm GC}=38$ kpc)
outer halo GC Palomar 15, based on medium-resolution spectra obtained with the
Keck/ESI instrument. Our results ascertain a low iron abundance of
$-$1.94$\pm$0.06 dex with no evidence of any significant abundance spreads,
although this is based on low number statistics. Overall, abundance ratios of
16 species were measured, including carbon, Na, Al, $\alpha$-peak (Mg,Si,Ca,Ti)
and Fe-peak (Sc,V,Cr,Fe,Co,Ni) elements, and the three neutron-capture elements
Sr, Ba, and Eu. The majority of abundances are compatible with those of halo
field stars and those found in other GCs in the outer and inner halos at
similar metallicity. Pal 15 is enhanced to [Mg/Fe]=0.45 dex, while other
$\alpha$-elements, Ca and Ti, are lower by 0.3 dex. Taking Mg as a
representative for [$\alpha$/Fe], and coupled with the lack of any significant
spread in any of the studied elements we conclude that Pal 15 is typical of the
outer halo, as is bolstered by its chemical similarity to the benchmark outer
halo cluster NGC 7492. One star shows evidence of elevated Na and Al
abundances, hinting at the presence of multiple stellar populations in this
cluster.

Title:On the patterns observed in Kepler multi-planet systems,"
Abstract:  Recent studies claimed that planets around the same star have similar sizes
and masses and regular spacings, and that planet pairs usually show ordered
sizes such that the outer planet is usually the larger one. Here I show that
these patterns can be largely explained by detection biases. The \emph{Kepler}
planet detections are set by the transit signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). For
different stellar properties and orbital period values, the same S/N
corresponds to different planetary sizes. This variation in the detection
threshold naturally leads to apparent correlations in planet sizes and the
observed size ordering. The apparently correlated spacings, measured in period
ratios, between adjacent planet pairs in systems with at least three detected
planets are partially due to the arbitrary upper limit that the earlier study
imposed on the period ratio, and partially due to the varying stability
threshold for different planets. After these detection biases are taken into
account, we do not find strong evidence for the so-called ""intra-system
uniformity"" or the size ordering effect. Instead, the physical properties of
\emph{Kepler} planets are largely independent of the properties of their
siblings and the parent star. It is likely that the dynamical evolution has
erased the memory of \emph{Kepler} planets about their initial formation
conditions. In other words, it will be difficult to infer the initial
conditions from the observed properties and the architecture of \emph{Kepler}
planets.

Title:The Role of Magnetic Field Geometry in the Evolution of Neutron Star Merger Accretion Discs,"
Abstract:  Neutron star mergers are unique laboratories of accretion, ejection, and
r-process nucleosynthesis. We used 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations to study the role of the post-merger magnetic geometry in the
evolution of merger remnant discs around stationary Kerr black holes. Our
simulations fully capture mass accretion, ejection, and jet production, owing
to their exceptionally long duration exceeding $4$ s. Poloidal post-merger
magnetic field configurations produce jets with energies $E_\mathrm{jet} \sim
(4{-}30)\times10^{50}$ erg, isotropic equivalent energies
$E_\mathrm{iso}\sim(4{-}20)\times10^{52}$ erg, opening angles
$\theta_\mathrm{jet}\sim6{-}13^\circ$, and durations $t_j\lesssim1$ s.
Accompanying the production of jets is the ejection of
$f_\mathrm{ej}\sim30{-}40\%$ of the post-merger disc mass, continuing out to
times $> 1$ s. We discover that a more natural, purely toroidal post-merger
magnetic field geometry generates large-scale poloidal magnetic flux of
alternating polarity and striped jets. The first stripe, of
$E_\mathrm{jet}\simeq2\times10^{48}\,\mathrm{erg}$, $E_\mathrm{iso}\sim10^{51}$
erg, $\theta_\mathrm{jet}\sim3.5{-}5^\circ$, and $t_j\sim0.1$ s, is followed by
$\gtrsim4$ s of striped jet activity with $f_\mathrm{ej}\simeq27\%$. The
dissipation of such stripes could power the short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) prompt
emission. Our simulated jet energies and durations span the range of sGRBs. We
find that although the blue kilonova component is initially hidden from view by
the red component, it expands faster, outruns the red component, and becomes
visible to off-axis observers. In comparison to GW 170817/GRB 170817A, our
simulations under-predict the mass of the blue relative to red component by a
factor of few. Including the dynamical ejecta and neutrino absorption may
reduce this tension.

Title:Screening maps of the local Universe I -- Methodology,"
Abstract:  We introduce the LOCal Universe Screening Test Suite (LOCUSTS) project, an
effort to create 'screening maps' in the nearby Universe to identify regions in
our neighbourhood which are screened, i.e., regions where deviations from
General Relativity (GR) are suppressed, in various modified gravity (MG)
models. In these models, deviations from the GR force law are often stronger
for smaller astrophysical objects, making them ideal test beds of gravity in
the local Universe. However, the actual behaviour of the modified gravity force
also depends on the environment of the objects, and to make accurate
predictions one has to take the latter into account. This can be done
approximately using luminous objects in the local Universe as tracers of the
underlying dark matter field. Here, we propose a new approach that takes
advantage of state-of-the-art Bayesian reconstruction of the mass distribution
in the Universe, which allows us to solve the modified gravity equations and
predict the screening effect more accurately. This is the first of a series of
works, in which we present our methodology and some qualitative results of
screening for a specific MG model, $f(R)$ gravity. Applications to test models
using observations and extensions to other classes of models will be studied in
future works.

Abstract:  We study the galactic bulges in the Auriga simulations, a suite of thirty

in Milky Way-sized dark matter haloes performed with the moving-mesh code
AREPO. We aim to characterize bulge formation mechanisms in this large suite of
galaxies simulated at high resolution in a fully cosmological context. The
bulges of the Auriga galaxies show a large variety in their shapes,sizes and
formation histories. According to observational classification criteria, such
as Sersic index and degree of ordered rotation, the majority of the Auriga
bulges can be classified as pseudo-bulges, while some of them can be seen as
composite bulges with a classical component; however, none can be classified as
a classical bulge. Auriga bulges show mostly an in-situ origin, 21 percent of
them with a negligible accreted fraction (facc < 0.01). In general,their
in-situ component was centrally formed, with 75 percent of the bulges forming
most of their stars inside the bulge region at z=0. Part of their in-situ mass
growth is rapid and is associated with the effects of mergers, while another
part is more secular in origin. In 90 percent of the Auriga bulges, the
accreted bulge component originates from less than four satellites.We
investigate the relation between the accreted stellar haloes and the bulges of
the Auriga simulations. The total bulge mass shows no correlation with the
accreted stellar halo mass, as in observations. However, the accreted mass of
bulges tends to correlate with their respective accreted stellar halo mass.

Title:The Bridge: a transient phenomenon of forming stellar multiples,"
Abstract:  Observations with modern instruments such as Herschel reveal that stars form
clustered inside filamentary arms of ~1 pc length embedded in Giant Molecular
Clouds. On smaller scales (~1000 au), observations of, e.g., IRAS 16293--2422
show signs of filamentary `bridge' structures connecting young protostars in
their birth environment. We investigate the formation of a deeply embedded
triple protostellar system, and characterize its connection to the filamentary
structure present on GMC scales. Using the magnetohydrodynamical code RAMSES,
we carry out zoom-in simulations of low-mass star formation starting from
Giant-Molecular-Cloud-scales. Colliding flows of gas in the filamentary arms
induce the formation of two protostellar companions at distances of ~1000 au
from the primary. After their birth, the stellar companions quickly (~10 kyr)
approach and orbit the primary on eccentric orbits with separations of ~100 au.
The colliding flows induce transient structures lasting for up to a few 10 kyr
connecting two forming protostellar objects that are kinematically quiescent
along the line-of-sight. Colliding flows compress the gas and trigger the
formation of stellar companions via turbulent fragmentation. Our results
suggest that protostellar companions form with a wide separation of ~1000 au.
Smaller separations (~100 au or less) are a consequence of subsequent migration
and capturing. Associated with the formation phase of the companion, the
turbulent environment induces arc- and bridge-like structures. These bridges
can become kinematically quiescent, when the velocity components of the
colliding flows eliminate each other. However, the gas in bridges still
contributes to stellar accretion later. Our results demonstrate: bridge-like
structures are a transient phenomenon of stellar multiple formation.

profile fitting. We show that the observed two-, three-point correlation
functions and reduced three-point correlation (i.e Q) are well reproduced by
our simulations. We assign probabilities for realising all the observed
correlation properties simultaneously using our simulations. Our simulations
suggest an increase in correlation amplitudes and Q with increasing $N_{\rm
HI}$. We roughly see this trend in the observations too. We identify a
concurrent gap of 17$\mathring{A}$ (i.e 14.2 $h^{-1}$cMpc, one of the longest
reported) wide in one of the triplets. Such gap is realised only in 14.2% of
our simulated sightlines and most of the time belongs to a void in the matter
distribution. In the second triplet, we detect DLAs along all three sightlines
(with spatial separations 0.64 to 1.6 pMpc) within a narrow redshift interval
(i.e $\Delta z = 0.088$). Detection of a foreground quasar ($\sim$ 1 pMpc from
the triplet sightlines) and excess partial Lyman Limit systems around these
DLAs suggest that we may be probing a large over-dense region. We also report
positive CIV- CIV correlations up to $\sim 500$ $km s^{-1}$ only in the
longitudinal direction. Additionally, we conclude a positive CIV-Ly$\alpha$
correlations for higher $N_{\rm HI}$ thresholds up to a scale of $\sim 1000$

Title:Exploring a new definition of the green valley and its implications,"
Abstract:  The distribution of galaxies on a colour-magnitude diagram reveals a
bimodality, featuring a passively evolving red sequence and a star-forming blue
cloud. The region between these two, the Green Valley (GV), represents a
fundamental transition where quenching processes operate. We exploit an
alternative definition of the GV using the 4,000 Angstrom break strength, an
indicator that is more resilient than colour to dust attenuation. We compare
and contrast our GV definition with the traditional one, based on
dust-corrected colour, making use of data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
Our GV selection - that does not need a dust correction and thus does not carry
the inherent systematics - reveals very similar trends regarding nebular
activity (star formation, AGN, quiescence) to the standard dust-corrected
$^{0.1}(g-r)$. By use of high SNR stacked spectra of the quiescent GV
subsample, we derive the simple stellar population (SSP) age difference across
the GV, a rough proxy of the quenching timescale ($\Delta$t). We obtain an
increasing trend with velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), from
$\Delta$t$\sim$1.5Gyr at $\sigma$=100km/s, up to 3.5Gyr at $\sigma$=200km/s,
followed by a rapid decrease in the most massive GV galaxies
($\Delta$t$\sim$1Gyr at $\sigma$=250km/s), suggesting two different modes of
quenching, or the presence of an additional channel (rejuvenation).

its intrinsic brightness (M_v~-22.7), it is expected to belong to a galaxy
cluster instead of a poor group. Observational material consists of g', r', i'

candidates present a clear bimodal colour distribution at different
galactocentric radii, with mean colours and dispersions for the metal-poor
(""blue"") and metal-rich (""red"") typical of old GCs. The red subpopulation
dominates close to the galaxy centre, in addition to the radial projected
distribution showing that they are more concentrated towards the galaxy centre.
The azimuthal projected distribution shows an overdensity in the red
subpopulation in the direction of a trail observed in X-ray that could be
evidence of interactions with its spiral neighbour NGC 6872. The turn-over of
the luminosity function gives an estimated distance modulus (m - M)~ 33.5 and
the total population amounts to 9400 GCs, i.e. a quite populous system. The

rapidly rotating UCDs tend to have strong radio emission - although this is not
always the case. We present radio observations of TRAPPIST-1 using ALMA at 97.5
GHz and the VLA at 44 GHz. TRAPPIST-1 was not detected at either frequency and
we place $3 \sigma$ upper flux limits of 10.6 and 16.2 $\mu$Jy, respectively.
We use our results to constrain the magnetic properties and possible outgoing
high energy particle radiation from the star. The presence of radio emission
from UCDs is indicative of a stellar environment that could pose a threat to
life on surrounding planets. Gyrosynchrotron emission, discernible at
frequencies between 20 and 100 GHz, is one of the only processes that can be
used to infer the presence of high energy particles released during magnetic
reconnection events. Since M dwarfs are frequent hosts of terrestrial planets,
characterizing their stellar emission is a crucial part of assessing
habitability. Exposure to outgoing high energy particle radiation - traceable
by radio flux - can erode planetary atmospheres. While our results do not imply
that the TRAPPIST-1 planets are suitable for life, we find no evidence that
they are overtly unsuitable due to proton fluxes.

"Title:Variation in the fine-structure constant, distance-duality relation and the next generation of high-resolution spectrograph","
Abstract:  The possibility of variation of the fundamental constants of nature has been
a long-standing question, with important consequences for fundamental physics
and cosmology. In particular, it has been shown that variations in the
fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, are directly related to violation of the
distance duality relation (DDR), which holds true as long as photons travel on
unique null geodesics and their number is conserved. In this paper we use the
currently available measurements of ${\Delta \alpha}/{\alpha}$ to impose the
most stringent constraints on departures of the DDR to date, here quantified by
the parameter $\eta$. We also perform a forecast analysis to discuss the
ability of the new generation of high-resolution spectrograph, like
ESPRESSO/VLT and E-ELT-HIRES, to constrain the DDR parameter $\eta$. From the
current data we obtain constraints on $\eta$ of the order of $10^{-7}$ whereas
the forecasted constraints are two orders of magnitude lower. Considering the
expected level of uncertainties of the upcoming measurements, we also estimate
the necessary number of data points to confirm the hypotheses behind the DDR.

Title:Supersoft X-ray emission from a white dwarf binary not powered by nuclear fusion,"
Abstract:  Supersoft X-ray sources are stellar objects which emit X-rays with
temperatures of about 1 million Kelvin and luminosities well in excess of what
can be produced by stellar coronae. It has generally been presumed that the
objects in this class are binary star systems in which mass transfer leads to
nuclear fusion on the surface of a white dwarf. Classical novae, the runaway
fusion events on the surfaces of white dwarfs, generally have supersoft phases,
and it is often stated that the bright steady supersoft X-ray sources seen from
white dwarfs accreting mass at a high rate are undergoing steady nuclear
fusion. In this letter, we report the discovery of a transient supersoft source
in the Small Magellanic Cloud without any signature of nuclear fusion having
taken place. This discovery indicates that the X-ray emission probably comes
from a ""spreading layer"" - a belt on the surface of the white dwarf near the
inner edge of the accretion disk in which a large fraction of the total
accretion energy is emitted - and (albeit more tentatively) that the accreting
white dwarf is relatively massive. We thus establish that the presence of a
supersoft source cannot always be used as a tracer of nuclear fusion, in
contradiction with decades-old consensus about the nature of supersoft
emission.

Title:Fractional Polarisation of Extragalactic Sources in the 500-square-degree SPTpol Survey,"
Abstract:  We study the polarisation properties of extragalactic sources at 95 and 150
GHz in the SPTpol 500 deg$^2$ survey. We estimate the polarised power by
stacking maps at known source positions, and correct for noise bias by
subtracting the mean polarised power at random positions in the maps. We show
that the method is unbiased using a set of simulated maps with similar noise
properties to the real SPTpol maps. We find a flux-weighted mean-squared
polarisation fraction $\langle p^2 \rangle= [8.9\pm1.1] \times 10^{-4}$ at 95
GHz and $[6.9\pm1.1] \times 10^{-4}$ at 150~GHz for the full sample. This is
consistent with the values obtained for a sub-sample of active galactic nuclei.
For dusty sources, we find 95 per cent upper limits of $\langle p^2
\rangle_{\rm 95}<16.9 \times 10^{-3}$ and $\langle p^2 \rangle_{\rm 150}<2.6
\times 10^{-3}$. We find no evidence that the polarisation fraction depends on
the source flux or observing frequency. The 1-$\sigma$ upper limit on measured
mean squared polarisation fraction at 150 GHz implies that extragalactic
foregrounds will be subdominant to the CMB E and B mode polarisation power
spectra out to at least $\ell\lesssim5700$ ($\ell\lesssim4700$) and
$\ell\lesssim5300$ ($\ell\lesssim3600$), respectively at 95 (150) GHz.

"Title:Solar models with convective overshoot, the solar-wind mass loss, and a PMS disk accretion: helioseismic quantities, Li depletion and neutrino fluxes","
Abstract:  Helioseismic observations have revealed many properties of the Sun: the depth
and the helium abundance of the convection zone, the sound-speed and the
density profiles in the solar interior. Those constraints have been used to
judge the stellar evolution theory. With the old solar composition (e.g.,
GS98), the solar standard model is in reasonable agreement with the
helioseismic constraints. However, a solar model with revised composition
(e.g., AGSS09) with low abundance $Z$ of heavy elements cannot be consistent
with those constraints. This is the so-called ""solar abundance problem"",
standing for more than ten years even with the recent upward revised Ne
abundance. Many mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate the problem. However,
there is still not a low-$Z$ solar model satisfying all helioseismic
constraints. In this paper, we report a possible solution to the solar
abundance problem. With some extra physical processes that are not included in
the standard model, solar models can be significantly improved. Our new solar
models with convective overshoot, the solar wind, and an early mass accretion
show consistency with helioseismic constraints, the solar Li abundance, and
observations of solar neutrino fluxes.

Abstract:  The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE), a satellite-based cosmic ray and
gamma-ray detector, was launched on December 17, 2015, and began its on-orbit

known GeV gamma-ray sources, and charge injection into the front-end

Title:Clues on Arp 142: The Spiral-Elliptical merger,"
Abstract:  Nearby merging pairs are unique laboratories in which one can study the
gravitational effects on the individual interacting components. In this
manuscript, we report the characterization of selected HII regions along the
peculiar galaxy NGC 2936, member of the galaxy pair Arp 142, an E+S
interaction, known as ""The Penguin"". Using Gemini South spectroscopy we have
derived a high enhancement of the global star formation rate SFR=35.9 Msun/yr
probably stimulated by the interaction. Star-forming regions on this galaxy
display oxygen abundances that are consistent with solar metallicities. The
current data set does not allow us to conclude any clear scenario for NGC 2936.
Diagnostic diagrams suggest that the central region of NGC 2936 is ionized by
AGN activity and the eastern tidal plume in NGC 2936 is experiencing a burst of
star formation, which may be triggered by the gas compression due to the
interaction event with its elliptical companion galaxy: NGC 2937. The
ionization mechanism of these sources is consistent with shock models of
low-velocities of 200-300 km/s The isophotal analysis shows tidal features on
NGC 2937: at inner radii non-concentric (or off-centering) isophotes, and at
large radii, a faint excess of the surface brightness profile with respect to
de Vaucouleurs law. By comparing the radial velocity profiles and morphological
characteristics of Arp 142 with a library of numerical simulations, we conclude
that the current stage of the system would be about 50 +-25 Myr after the first
pericenter passage.

Title:Influence of macroclumping on type II supernova light curves,"
Abstract:  Core-collapse supernova (SN) ejecta are probably structured on both small and
large scales, with greater deviations from spherical symmetry nearer the
explosion site. Here, we present 2D and 3D gray radiation-hydrodynamics
simulations of type II SN light curves from red (RSG) and blue supergiant (BSG)
star explosions to investigate the impact on SN observables of inhomogeneities
in density or composition, with a characteristic scale set to a few percent of
the local radius. Clumping is found to hasten the release of stored radiation,
boosting the early time luminosity and shortening the photospheric phase.
Around the photosphere, radiation leaks between the clumps where the photon
mean free path is greater. Since radiation is stored uniformly in volume, a
greater clumping can increase this leakage by storing more and more mass into
smaller and denser clumps containing less and less radiation energy. An
inhomogeneous medium in which different regions recombine at different
temperatures can also impact the light curve. Clumping can thus be a source of
diversity in SN brightness. Clumping may lead to a systematic underestimate of
ejecta masses from light curve modeling, although a significant offset seems to
require a large density contrast of a few tens between clumps and interclump
medium.

Title:Smoking Gun of the Dynamical Processing of the Solar-type Field Binary Stars,"
Abstract:  We investigate the binarity properties in field stars using more than 50\,000
main-sequence stars with stellar mass from 0.4 to 0.85\,$M_\odot$ observed by
LAMOST and {\emph Gaia} in the solar neighborhood. By adopting a power-law
shape of the mass-ratio distribution with power index of $\gamma$, we conduct a
hierarchical Bayesian model to derive the binary fraction ($f_{b}$) and
$\gamma$ for stellar populations with different metallicities and primary
masses ($m_1$). We find that $f_b$ is tightly anti-correlated with $\gamma$,
i.e. the populations with smaller binary fraction contains more binaries with
larger mass-ratio and vice versa.The high-$\gamma$ populations with
$\gamma>1.2$ have lower stellar mass and higher metallicity, while the
low-$\gamma$ populations with $\gamma<1.2$ have larger mass or lower
metallicity. The $f_b$ of the high-$\gamma$ group is anti-correlated with
[Fe/H] but flat with $m_1$.Meanwhile, the $f_b$ of the low-$\gamma$ group
displays clear correlation with $m_1$ but quite flat with [Fe/H]. The
substantial differences are likely due to the dynamical processing when the
binaries were in the embedded star clusters in their early days. The dynamical
processing tends to destroy binaries with smaller primary mass, smaller
mass-ratio, and wider separation. Consequently, the high-$\gamma$ group
containing smaller $m_1$ is more effectively influenced and hence contains less
binaries, many of which have larger mass-ratio and shorter period. However, the
low-$\gamma$ group is less affected by the dynamical processing due to their
larger $m_1$. These are evident that the dynamical processing does effectively
work and significantly reshape the present-day binary properties of field
stars.

Title:On the nature of a shell of young stars in the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud,"
Abstract:  Understanding the evolutionary history of the Magellanic Clouds requires an
in-depth exploration and characterization of the stellar content in their outer
regions, which ultimately are key to tracing the epochs and nature of past
interactions. We present new deep images of a shell-like over-density of stars
in the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The shell, also detected
in photographic plates dating back to the fifties, is located at ~1.9 degr from
the center of the SMC in the north-east direction.The structure and stellar
content of this feature were studied with multi-band, optical data from the
Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH) carried out with the Dark
Energy Camera on the Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American
Observatory. We also investigate the kinematic of the stars in the shell using
the Gaia Data Release 2. The shell is composed of a young population with an
age ~ 150 Myr, with no contribution from an old population. Thus, it is hard to
explain its origin as the remnant of a tidally disrupted stellar system. The
spatial distribution of the young main-sequence stars shows a rich
sub-structure, with a spiral arm-like feature emanating from the main shell and
a separated small arc of young stars close to the globular cluster NGC 362. We
find that the absolute g-band magnitude of the shell is M_{g,shell} = -10.78+/-
0.02, with a surface brightness of mu_{g,shell} = 25.81+/- 0.01 mag/arcsec^{2}.
We have not found any evidence that this feature is of tidal origin or a bright
part of a spiral arm-like structure. Instead, we suggest that the shell formed
in a recent star formation event, likely triggered by an interaction with the
Large Magellanic Cloud and/or the Milky Way, ~150 Myr ago.

Title:Formation of supermassive primordial black holes by Affleck-Dine mechanism,"
Abstract:  We study the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed in the galactic
centers. Although the origin of SMBHs has not been well understood yet,
previous studies suggest that seed black holes (BHs) with masses
$10^{4-5}M_\odot$ exist at a high redshift ($z \sim 10$). We examine whether
primordial black holes (PBHs) produced by inhomogeneous baryogenesis can
explain those seed black holes. The inhomogeneous baryogenesis is realized in
the modified Affleck-Dine mechanism. In this scenario, there is no stringent
constraint from CMB $\mu$-distortion in contrast to the scenario where Gaussian
fluctuations collapse into PBHs. It is found that the model can account for the
origin of the seed BHs of the SMBHs.

how these effects should make it possible to learn about the eccentricity

Title:Accelerated FDPS --- Algorithms to Use Accelerators with FDPS,"
Abstract:  In this paper, we describe the algorithms we implemented in FDPS to make
efficient use of accelerator hardware such as GPGPUs. We have developed FDPS to
make it possible for many researchers to develop their own high-performance
parallel particle-based simulation programs without spending large amount of
time for parallelization and performance tuning. The basic idea of FDPS is to
provide a high-performance implementation of parallel algorithms for
particle-based simulations in a ""generic"" form, so that researchers can define
their own particle data structure and interparticle interaction functions and
supply them to FDPS. FDPS compiled with user-supplied data type and interaction
function provides all necessary functions for parallelization, and using those
functions researchers can write their programs as though they are writing
simple non-parallel program. It has been possible to use accelerators with
FDPS, by writing the interaction function that uses the accelerator. However,
the efficiency was limited by the latency and bandwidth of communication
between the CPU and the accelerator and also by the mismatch between the
available degree of parallelism of the interaction function and that of the
hardware parallelism. We have modified the interface of user-provided
interaction function so that accelerators are more efficiently used. We also
implemented new techniques which reduce the amount of work on the side of CPU
and amount of communication between CPU and accelerators. We have measured the
performance of N-body simulations on a systems with NVIDIA Volta GPGPU using
FDPS and the achieved performance is around 27 \% of the theoretical peak
limit. We have constructed a detailed performance model, and found that the
current implementation can achieve good performance on systems with much
smaller memory and communication bandwidth.

Abstract:  The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) has observed bright spots at
the transition region footpoints associated with heating in the overlying

significant blueshifts in the Si iv line at 1402.77 A (logT[K] = 4.9). Such
blueshifts cannot be reproduced by coronal loop models assuming heating by
thermal conduction only, but are consistent with electron beam heating,
highlighting for the first time the possible importance of non-thermal
electrons in the heating of non-flaring active regions. Here we report on the
coronal counterparts of these brightenings observed in the hot channels of the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We
show that the IRIS bright spots are the footpoints of very hot and transient
coronal loops which clearly experience strong magnetic interactions and
rearrangements, thus confirming the impulsive nature of the heating and
providing important constraints for their physical interpretation.

Abstract:  This paper constraints dynamic dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameters
using the type Ia supernovae from Union 2.1 dataset. The paper also discusses
the dependency of dynamic dark energy EoS parameters on the chosen or assumed
value of the Hubble Constant. To understand the correlation between the Hubble
Constant values and measured dynamic dark energy EoS parameters, we used recent
surveys being done through various techniques such as cosmic microwave
background studies, gravitational waves, baryonic acoustic oscillations and
standard candles to set values for different Hubble Constant values as fixed
parameters with CPL and WCDM models. Then we applied trust region reflective
(TRF) and dog leg (dogbox) algorithms to fit dark energy density parameter and
dynamic dark energy EoS parameters. We found a significant negative correlation
between the fixed Hubble Constant parameter and measured EoS parameter, w0.
Then we used two best fit Hubble Constant values (70 and 69.18474) km $s^{-1}$
$Mpc^{-1}$ based on Chi-square test to test more dark energy EoS parameters
like: JBP, BA, PADE-I, PADE-II, and LH4 models and compared the results with
$\Lambda$-CDM with constant $w_{de}$=-1, WCDM and CPL models. We conclude that
flat $\Lambda$-CDM and WCDM models clearly provide best results while using the
BIC criteria as it severely penalizes the use of extra parameters. However, the
dependency of EoS parameters on Hubble Constant value and the increasing
tension in the measurement of Hubble Constant values using different techniques
warrants further investigation into looking for optimal dynamic dark energy EoS
models to optimally model the relation between the expansion rate and evolution
of dark energy in our universe.

Title:Constraining neutrino mass and dark energy with peculiar velocities and lensing dispersions of Type Ia supernovae,"
Abstract:  We show that peculiar velocities of Type Ia supernovae can be used to derive
constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_{\nu}$, and dark energy
equation of state, $w = w_0+w_a(1-a)$, from measurements of the
magnitude-redshift relation, complementary to galaxy redshift and weak lensing
surveys. Light from a supernova propagates through a perturbed Universe so the
luminosity distance is modified from its homogeneous prediction. This
modification is proportional to the matter density fluctuation and its time
derivative due to gravitational lensing and peculiar velocity respectively. At
low redshifts, the peculiar velocity signal dominates while at high redshifts
lensing does. We show that using lensing and peculiar velocity of supernovae
from the upcoming surveys WFIRST and ZTF, without other observations, we can
constrain $\Sigma m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.31$ eV, $\sigma(w_0) \lesssim 0.02$, and
${\sigma(w_a)} \lesssim 0.18$ ($1-\sigma$ CL) in the $\Sigma
m_{\nu}$-$w_0$-$w_a$ parameter space, where all the other cosmological
parameters are fixed. We find that adding peculiar velocity information from
low redshifts shrinks the volume of the parameter ellipsoid in this space by
$\sim 33$%. We also allow $\Omega_{\text{CDM}}$ to vary as well as $\Sigma
m_{\nu}$, $w_0$ and $w_a$, and demonstrate how these constraints degrade as a
consequence.

Title:Reconstructing large-scale structure with neutral hydrogen surveys,"
Abstract:  Upcoming 21-cm intensity surveys will use the hyperfine transition in
emission to map out neutral hydrogen in large volumes of the universe.
Unfortunately, large spatial scales are completely contaminated with spectrally
smooth astrophysical foregrounds which are orders of magnitude brighter than
the signal. This contamination also leaks into smaller radial and angular modes
to form a foreground wedge, further limiting the usefulness of 21-cm
observations for different science cases, especially cross-correlations with
tracers that have wide kernels in the radial direction. In this paper, we
investigate reconstructing these modes within a forward modeling framework.
Starting with an initial density field, a suitable bias parameterization and
non-linear dynamics to model the observed 21-cm field, our reconstruction
proceeds by combining the likelihood of a forward simulation to match the
observations (under given modeling error and a data noise model) with the
Gaussian prior on initial conditions and maximizing the obtained posterior. For
redshifts $z=2$ and $4$, we are able to reconstruct 21cm field with cross
correlation, $r_c > 0.8$ on all scales for both our optimistic and pessimistic
assumptions about foreground contamination and for different levels of thermal
noise. The performance deteriorates slightly at $z=6$. The large-scale
line-of-sight modes are reconstructed almost perfectly. We demonstrate how our
method also reconstructs baryon acoustic oscillations, outperforming standard
methods on all scales. We also describe how our reconstructed field can provide
superb clustering redshift estimation at high redshifts, where it is otherwise
extremely difficult to obtain dense spectroscopic samples, as well as open up
cross-correlation opportunities with projected fields (e.g. lensing) which are
restricted to modes transverse to the line of sight.

computed with the code CMFGEN. We uncover a population of 25 early-type (OB and
Wolf-Rayet) stars, 19 being newly discovered by our observations out of which
15 are likely cluster members. The cluster's spectrophotometric distance is
10.2+/-1.6 kpc, placing it close to the intersection of the galactic bar and
the Norma arm, beyond the galactic center. This makes VVV CL074 one the
farthest young massive clusters identified so far. Among the massive stars
population, three objects are Wolf-Rayet stars, the remaining are O and B
stars. From the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram we find that most stars have an age
between 3 and 6 Myr according to the Geneva evolutionary tracks. WN8 and WC8-9
stars are the descendants of stars with initial masses between 40 and 60 Msun.
The massive star population of VVV CL074 is very similar to that of the cluster
DBS2003-179 and to a lesser extent to that of the Quintuplet cluster,
indicating the same age. The central cluster of the Galaxy is ~3 Myr older.
From the comparison of the massive stars populations in these four clusters,

Msun likely go through a WN8-9 phase.

Title:Signature of solar g modes in first-order p-mode frequency shifts,"
Abstract:  Context. Solar gravity modes (g modes) are buoyancy waves trapped in the
solar radiative zone that have been very difficult to detect at the surface.
Solar g modes would complement solar pressure modes (p modes) in probing the
central regions of the Sun, for example the core rotation rate.
Aims. A detection of g modes using changes in the large frequency separation
of p modes has recently been reported. However, it is unclear how p and g modes
interact. The aim of this study is to evaluate to what extent g modes can
perturb the frequencies of p modes.
Methods. We computed the first-order perturbation to global p-mode
frequencies due to a flow field and perturbations to solar structure caused by
a g mode. We focused on long-period g modes and assumed that the g-mode
perturbations are constant in time. The surface amplitude of g modes is assumed
to be $1$ mm s$^{-1}$, which is close to the observational limit.
Results. Gravity modes do perturb p-mode frequencies to first order if the
harmonic degree of the g mode is even and if its azimuthal order is zero. The
effect is extremely small. For dipole and quadrupole p modes, all frequency
shifts are smaller than $0.1$ nHz, or $2\times10^{-8}$ in relative numbers.
This is because the relative perturbation to solar structure quantities caused
by a g mode of realistic amplitude is of the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5}$.
We find that structural changes dominate over advection. Surprisingly, the
interaction of g and p modes takes place to a large part near the surface,
where p modes spend most of their propagation times and g modes generate the
largest relative changes to solar structure.
Conclusions. It appears to be impossible to detect g modes solely through
their signature in p-mode frequency shifts. Whether g modes leave a detectable
signature in p-mode travel times under a given observational setup remains an
open question.

Title:Apse-alignment in narrow-eccentric ringlets and its implications for the EPSILON-ring of Uranus and the ring system of (10199) Chariklo,"
Abstract:  The discovery of ring systems around objects of the outer Solar System
provides a strong motivation to apply theoretical models in order to better
estimate their physical and orbital parameters, which can constrain scenarios
for their origin. We review the criterion for maintaining apse-alignment across
a ring and the balance between the energy input rate provided by a close by
satellite and the internal dissipation rate occurring through ring particle
collisions that is required to maintain ring eccentricity, as derived from the
equations of motion governing the Lagrangian-displacements of the ring-particle
orbits. We use the case of the epsilon-ring of Uranus, to calibrate our
theoretical discussion and illustrate the basic dynamics governing these types
of ring. In the case of the ring system of (10199) Chariklo, where the evidence
that the rings are eccentric is not conclusive, we apply the theory of
apse-alignment to derive information about the most plausible combination of
values of the surface density and eccentricity-gradient, as well as the masses
and locations of their postulated but -presently
undetected-shepherd-satellites. When the balance conditions that we predict are
applied to the ring system of (10199) Chariklo, we are able to estimate the
minimum mass of a shepherd satellite required to prevent eccentricity decay, as
a function of its orbital location, for two different models of dissipation. We
conclude that the satellite mass required to maintain the m = 1 eccentric mode
in the ring, would be similar or smaller than that needed to confine the rings
radially.

Title:Do evolved stars in the LMC show dual dust chemistry?,"
Abstract:  We study a group of evolved M-stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud,
characterized by a peculiar spectral energy distribution. While the $9.7~\mu$m
feature arises from silicate particles, the whole infrared data seem to suggest
the presence of an additional featureless dust species. We propose that the
circumstellar envelopes of these sources are characterized by a dual dust
chemistry, with an internal region, harbouring carbonaceous particles, and an
external zone, populated by silicate, iron and alumina dust grains. Based on
the comparison with results from stellar modelling that describe the dust
formation process, we deduce that these stars descend from low-mass ($M <
2~M_{\odot}$) objects, formed $1-4$ Gyr ago, currently evolving either in the
post-AGB phase or through an after-pulse phase, when the shell CNO nuclear
activity is temporarily extinguished. Possible observations able to confirm or
disregard the present hypothesis are discussed.

Title:The missing dwarf galaxies of the Local Group,"
Abstract:  We study the Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxy population predicted by the
\apostle $\Lambda$CDM cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. These indicate
that: (i)~the total mass within $3$ Mpc of the Milky Way-Andromeda midpoint
($M_{\rm 3Mpc}$) typically exceeds $\sim 3$ times the sum of the virial masses
($M_{\rm 200crit}$) of the two primaries and (ii)~the dwarf galaxy formation
efficiency per unit mass is uniform throughout the volume. This suggests that
the satellite population within the virial radii of the Milky Way and Andromeda
should make up fewer than one third of all LG dwarfs within $3$ Mpc. This is
consistent with the fraction of observed LG galaxies with stellar mass
$M_*>10^7\,M_{\odot}$ that are satellites ($12$ out of $42$; i.e., $28$ per
cent). For the \apostle galaxy mass-halo mass relation, the total number of
such galaxies further suggests a LG mass of $M_{\rm 3 Mpc}\sim 10^{13} \,
M_{\odot}$. At lower galaxy masses, however, the observed satellite fraction is
substantially higher ($42$ per cent for $M_*>10^5\,M_{\odot}$). If this is due
to incompleteness in the field sample, then $\sim 50$ dwarf galaxies at least
as massive as the Draco dwarf spheroidal must be missing from the current LG
{\it field} dwarf inventory. The incompleteness interpretation is supported by
the pronounced flattening of the LG luminosity function below $M_*\sim 10^7\,
M_{\odot}$, and by the scarcity of low-surface brightness LG field galaxies
compared to satellites. The simulations indicate that most missing dwarfs
should lie near the virial boundaries of the two LG primaries, and predict a
trove of nearby dwarfs that await discovery by upcoming wide-field imaging
surveys.

Title:Sub-arcsecond (sub)millimeter imaging of the massive protocluster G358.93-0.03: Discovery of 14 new methanol maser lines associated with a hot core,"
Abstract:  We present (sub)millimeter imaging at 0.5'' resolution of the massive
star-forming region G358.93-0.03 acquired in multiple epochs at 2 and 3 months
following the recent flaring of its 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission. Using SMA
and ALMA, we have discovered 14 new Class II methanol maser lines ranging in
frequency from 199 GHz to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from vt=1
torsionally-excited transitions and include one vt=2 transition. The latter
detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping
involves levels in the vt=2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest
continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a
consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1,
suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the
thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive
position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature
or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly
over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0 to 7.2, with the
vt=2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only
the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven
additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot
core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter
continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and
the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single dish
measurements.

Title:Planetesimals Around Stars with TESS (PAST): I. Transient Dimming of a Binary Solar Analog at the End of the Planet Accretion Era,"
Abstract:  We report detection of quasi-periodic (1.5 day) dimming of HD 240779, the
solar-mass primary in a 5"" visual binary (also TIC 284730577), by the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. This dimming, as has been shown for
other ""dipper"" stars, is likely due to occultation by circumstellar dust. The
barycentric space motion, lithium abundance, rotation, and chromospheric
emission of the stars in this system point to an age of ~125 Myr, and possible
membership in the AB Doradus moving group. As such it occupies an important but
poorly explored intermediate regime of stars with transient dimming between
young stellar objects in star forming regions and main sequence stars, and
between UX Orionis-type Ae/Be stars and M-type ""dippers"". HD 240779, but not
its companion BD+10714B, has WISE-detected excess infrared emission at 12 and
22 microns indicative of circumstellar dust. We propose that infrared emission
is produced by collisions of planetesimals during clearing of a residual disk
at the end of rocky planet formation, and that quasi-periodic dimming is
produced by the rapid disintegration of a 100 km planetesimal near the silicate
evaporation radius. Further studies of this and similar systems will illuminate
a poorly understood final phase of rocky planet formation like that which
produced the inner Solar System.

Title:An Examination of Galactic Polarization with Application to the Planck TB Correlation,"
Abstract:  Angular power spectra computed from Planck HFI 353 GHz intensity and
polarization maps produce a TB correlation that can be approximated by a power
law. Whether the observed TB correlation is an induced systematic feature or a
physical property of Galactic dust emission is of interest both for
cosmological and Galactic studies. We investigate the large angular scale E-
and B-mode morphology of microwave polarized thermal dust emission, and relate
it to physical quantities of polarization angle and polarization fraction. We
use empirical models of polarized dust to show that dust polarization angle is
a key factor in producing the TB correlation. A small sample of both simulated
and observed polarization angle maps are combined with 353 GHz intensity and
dust polarization fraction to produce a suite of maps from which we compute TB
and EB. Model realizations that produce a positive TB correlation are common
and can result from large-scale (>5 degree) structure in the polarization
angle. The TB correlation appears robust to introduction of individual
intensity, polarization angle and polarization fraction model components that
are independent of the 353 GHz observations. We conclude that the observed TB
correlation is likely the result of large-scale Galactic dust polarization
properties.

Title:Effect of polarisation and choice of event generator on spectra from dark matter annihilations,"
Abstract:  If indirect detection searches are to be used to discriminate between dark
matter particle models, it is crucial to understand the expected energy spectra
of secondary particles such as neutrinos, charged antiparticles and gamma-rays
emerging from dark matter annihilations in the local Universe. In this work we
study the effect that both the choice of event generator and the polarisation
of the final state particles can have on these predictions. For a variety of
annihilation channels and dark matter masses, we compare yields obtained with
Pythia8 and Herwig7 of all of the aforementioned secondary particle species. We
investigate how polarised final states can change these results and do an
extensive study of how the polarisation can impact the expected flux of
neutrinos from dark matter annihilations in the centre of the Sun.
We find that differences between the event generators are larger for yields
of hadronic end products such as antiprotons, than for leptonic end products.
Concerning polarisation, we conversely find the largest differences in the
leptonic spectra. The large differences in the leptonic spectra point to the
importance of including polarisation effects in searches for neutrinos from
dark matter annihilations in the Sun. However, we find that these differences
are ultimately somewhat washed out by propagation effects of the neutrinos in
the Sun.

Title:On the Unusually Large Spatial Extent of the TeV nebula HESS J1825-137: Implication from the Energy-Dependent Morphology,"
Abstract:  Deep observation of the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) on the most
extended pulsar wind nebula HESS J1825-137 reveals an enhanced energy-dependent
morphology, providing useful information on the particle transport mechanism in
the nebula. We find that the energy-dependent morphology is consistent with a
diffusion-dominated transport of electrons/positrons. It provides an
alternative possible interpretation for the unusually large spatial extent
(i.e., $\gtrsim 100$pc) of the nebula, which could then be attributed to the
diffusion of escaping electrons/positrons from a compact plerion. The influence
of various model parameters on the energy-dependent extent of the nebula is
studied in the diffusion-dominated scenario. We also show that the
energy-dependent morphology of the nebula may also be used to study the
spin-down history of the pulsar.

Title:Detection of anti-correlation of hot and cold baryons in galaxy clusters,"
Abstract:  The largest clusters of galaxies in the Universe contain vast amounts of dark
matter, plus baryonic matter in two principal phases, a majority hot gas
component and a minority cold stellar phase comprising stars, compact objects,
and low-temperature gas. Hydrodynamic simulations indicate that the
highest-mass systems retain the cosmic fraction of baryons, a natural
consequence of which is anti-correlation between the masses of hot gas and
stars within dark matter halos of fixed total mass. We report observational
detection of this anti-correlation based on 4 elements of a $9\times9$ element
covariance matrix for nine cluster properties, measured from X-ray, optical,
infrared and millimetre wavelength observations of 41 clusters from the Local
Cluster Substructure Survey. These clusters were selected using explicit and
quantitative selection rules that were then encoded in our hierarchical
Bayesian model. Our detection of anti-correlation is consistent with
predictions from contemporary hydrodynamic cosmological simulations that were
not tuned to reproduce this signal.

Title:Reflection geometries in absorbed and unabsorbed AGN,"
Abstract:  The hard X-ray emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and in particular,
the reflection component, is shaped by the innermost and outer regions of the
galactic nucleus. Our main goal is to investigate the variation of the Compton
hump amongst a population of sources and correlate it with other spectral
properties to constrain the source geometry. We studied the NuSTAR hard X-ray
spectra of a sample of 83 AGN and performed a detailed spectral analysis of
each of them. Based on their spectral shape, we divided the sample into five
categories and also studied their stacked spectra. We found a stronger
reflection in mildly obscured sources, which verifies the results reported in
previous works. In addition, the reflection behaviour, and probably origin,
varies with absorption. The accretion disc seems to be the main reflector in
unabsorbed sources. A clumpy torus seems to produce most of the reflection in
obscured sources. The filling factor of the clouds surrounding the active
nucleus is a key parameter that drives the appearance of AGN. Finally, we found
that the Fe line and the Compton hump are roughly correlated, as expected.

Title:Identifying Stellar Streams in Gaia DR2 with Data Mining Techniques,"
Abstract:  Streams of stars from captured dwarf galaxies and dissolved globular clusters
are identifiable through the similarity of their orbital parameters, a fact
that remains true long after the streams have dispersed spatially. We calculate
the integrals of motion for 44855 stars, to a distance of 4 kpc from the Sun,
which have full and accurate 6D phase space positions in the Gaia DR2
catalogue. We then apply a novel combination of data mining, numerical and
statistical techniques to search for stellar streams. This process returns
seven high-confidence streams (including four that were not previously known),
all of which display tight clustering in the integral of motion space.
Colour-magnitude diagrams indicate that these streams are relatively simple,
old, metal-poor populations. A combined evaluation of the kinematics and
colour-magnitude properties suggests that the previously undiscovered streams
are fragments of the Gaia-Enceladus progenitor. The success of this project
demonstrates the usefulness of data mining techniques in exploring large
datasets.

Title:A SHARP view of H0LiCOW: $H_{0}$ from three time-delay gravitational lens systems with adaptive optics imaging,"
Abstract:  We present the measurement of the Hubble Constant, $H_0$, with three strong
gravitational lens systems. We describe a blind analysis of both PG1115+080 and
HE0435-1223 as well as an extension of our previous analysis of RXJ1131-1231.
For each lens, we combine new adaptive optics (AO) imaging from the Keck
Telescope, obtained as part of the SHARP AO effort, with Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) imaging, velocity dispersion measurements, and a description of the
line-of-sight mass distribution to build an accurate and precise lens mass
model. This mass model is then combined with the COSMOGRAIL measured time
delays in these systems to determine $H_{0}$. We do both an AO-only and an
AO+HST analysis of the systems and find that AO and HST results are consistent.
After unblinding, the AO-only analysis gives $H_{0}=82.8^{+9.4}_{-8.3}~\rm
km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$ for PG1115+080, $H_{0}=70.1^{+5.3}_{-4.5}~\rm
km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$ for HE0435-1223, and $H_{0}=77.0^{+4.0}_{-4.6}~\rm
km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$ for RXJ1131-1231. The joint AO-only result for the three
lenses is $H_{0}=75.6^{+3.2}_{-3.3}~\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. The joint result
of the AO+HST analysis for the three lenses is $H_{0}=76.8^{+2.6}_{-2.6}~\rm
km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. All of the above results assume a flat $\Lambda$ cold
dark matter cosmology with a uniform prior on $\Omega_{\textrm{m}}$ in [0.05,
0.5] and $H_{0}$ in [0, 150] $\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. This work is a
collaboration of the SHARP and H0LiCOW teams, and shows that AO data can be
used as the high-resolution imaging component in lens-based measurements of
$H_0$. The full time-delay cosmography results from a total of six strongly

Abstract:  We report on ~0.35""(~2 kpc) resolution observations of the [CII] and dust
continuum emission from five z>6 quasar host-companion galaxy pairs obtained
with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The [CII] emission is
resolved in all galaxies, with physical extents of 3.2-5.4 kpc. The dust
continuum is on-average 40% more compact, which results in larger [CII]
deficits in the center of the galaxies. However, the measured [CII] deficits
are fully consistent with those found at lower redshifts. Four of the galaxies
show [CII] velocity fields that are consistent with ordered rotation, while the
remaining six galaxies show no clear velocity gradient. All galaxies have high
(~80-200 km/s) velocity dispersions, consistent with the interpretation that
the interstellar medium (ISM) of these high redshift galaxies is turbulent. By
fitting the galaxies with kinematic models, we estimate the dynamical mass of
these systems, which range between (0.3 -> 5.4) x 1E10 Msun. For the three
closest separation galaxy pairs, we observe dust and [CII] emission from gas in
between and surrounding the galaxies, which is an indication that tidal
interactions are disturbing the gas in these systems. Although gas exchange in
these tidal interactions could power luminous quasars, the existence of quasars
in host galaxies without nearby companions suggests that tidal interactions are
not the only viable method for fueling their active centers. These observations
corroborate the assertion that accreting supermassive black holes do not
substantially contribute to the [CII] and dust continuum emission of the quasar
host galaxies, and showcase the diverse ISM properties of galaxies when the
universe was less than one billion years old.

Abstract:  We still do not understand how planets form, or why extra-solar planetary
systems are so different from our own solar system. But the last few years have
dramatically changed our view of the discs of gas and dust around young stars.
Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and
extreme adaptive-optics systems have revealed that most --- if not all ---
discs contain substructure, including rings and gaps, spirals, azimuthal dust
concentrations, and shadows cast by misaligned inner discs. These features have
been interpreted as signatures of newborn protoplanets, but the exact origin is
unknown. Here we report the kinematic detection of a few Jupiter-mass planet
located in a gas and dust gap at 130 au in the disc surrounding the young star
HD 97048. An embedded planet can explain both the disturbed Keplerian flow of
the gas, detected in CO lines, and the gap detected in the dust disc at the
same radius. While gaps appear to be a common feature in protoplanetary discs,
we present a direct correspondence between a planet and a dust gap, indicating
that at least some gaps are the result of planet-disc interactions.

Title:Interacting Young M-dwarfs in Triple System -- Par 1802 Binary System Case Study,"
Abstract:  The binary star Par 1802 in the Orion Nebula presents an interesting puzzle
in the field of stellar dynamics and evolution. Binary systems such as Par 1802
are thought to form from the same natal material and thus the stellar members
are expected to have very similar physical attributes. However, Par 1802's
stars have significantly different temperatures despite their identical (within
$3\%$) masses of about $0.39$ solar mass. The leading proof-of-concept idea is
that a third companion gravitationally induced the two stars to orbit closer
than their Roche-limit, which facilitated heating through tidal effects. Here
we expand on this idea and study the three-body dynamical evolution of such a
system, including tidal and pre-main-sequence evolution. We also include tidal
heating and mass transfer at the onset of Roche-limit Crossing. We show, as a
proof-of-concept, that mass transfer combined with tidal heating can naturally
explain the observed temperature discrepancy. We also predict the orbital
configuration of the possible tertiary companion. Finally we suggest that the
dynamical evolution of such a system has pervasive consequences. We expect an
abundance of systems to undergo mass transfer during their pre-main-sequence
time, which can cause temperature differences.

"Title:Clustering with JWST: Constraining Galaxy Host Halo Masses, Satellite Quenching Efficiencies, and Merger Rates at z=4-10","
Abstract:  Galaxy clustering measurements can be used to constrain many aspects of
galaxy evolution, including galaxy host halo masses, satellite quenching
efficiencies, and merger rates. We simulate JWST galaxy clustering measurements
at z$\sim$4$-$10 by utilizing mock galaxy samples produced by an empirical
model, the UniverseMachine. We also adopt the survey footprints and typical
depths of the planned joint NIRCam and NIRSpec Guaranteed Time Observation
program planned for Cycle 1 to generate realistic JWST survey realizations and
to model high-redshift galaxy selection completeness. We find that galaxy
clustering will be measured with $\gtrsim$5$\sigma$ significance at
z$\sim$4$-$10. Halo mass precisions resulting from Cycle 1 angular clustering
measurements will be $\sim$0.2 dex for faint (-18 $\gtrsim$
$\mathit{M}_{\mathrm{UV}}^{ }$ $\gtrsim$ -19) galaxies at z$\sim$4$-$10 as well
as $\sim$0.3 dex for bright ($\mathit{M}_{\mathrm{UV}}^{ }$ $\sim$ -20)
galaxies at z$\sim$4$-$7. Dedicated spectroscopic follow-up over $\sim$150
arcmin$^2$ would improve these precisions by $\sim$0.1 dex by removing chance
projections and low-redshift contaminants. Future JWST observations will
therefore provide the first constraints on the stellar-halo mass relation in
the epoch of reionization and substantially clarify how this relation evolves
at z$>$4. We also find that $\sim$1000 individual satellites will be
identifiable at z$\sim$4$-$8 with JWST, enabling strong tests of satellite
quenching evolution beyond currently available data (z$\lesssim$2). Finally, we
find that JWST observations can measure the evolution of galaxy major merger
pair fractions at z$\sim$4$-$8 with $\sim$0.1$-$0.2 dex uncertainties. Such
measurements would help determine the relative role of mergers to the build-up
of stellar mass into the epoch of reionization.

matter produced in various type collisions with ultra-high energy cosmic ray

Based on the analytic functions suggested previously elsewhere, estimations for

various particle collisions at energies of UHECR. The space particle densities
at freeze-out are derived also and allow the possibility of novel features for
secondary particle production like Bose-Einstein condensation at least for
nuclear interactions with UHECR particles. The estimations obtained for global
and geometrical parameters indicate the creation of deconfined quark-gluon
matter with large enough volume and lifetime even in light nuclear collisions
at UHECR energies. These quantitative results can be important for both the
future collider experiments at center-of-mass energy frontier and the

companion galaxies of four quasars at $z\gtrsim 6$, specifically acquired to
probe their stellar content and unobscured star formation rate. Three companion
galaxies do not show significant emission in the observed optical/IR wavelength
range. The photometric limits suggest that these galaxies are highly
dust-enshrouded, with unobscured star formation rates SFR$_{\rm UV}<$few
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and a stellar content of $M_{*}<$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$. However, the companion to PJ167-13 shows bright rest-frame UV

Title:Joint estimation of the Epoch of Reionization power spectrum and foregrounds,"
Abstract:  The power spectrum of redshifted 21 cm emission brightness temperature
fluctuations is a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). However,
bright foreground emission presents a significant impediment to its unbiased
recovery from interferometric data. We build on the Bayesian power spectral
estimation methodology introduced in Sims et al. 2016 and demonstrate that
incorporating a priori knowledge of the spectral structure of foregrounds in

improved modelling of the foregrounds without increasing the model complexity.
We explore two astrophysically motivated parametrisations of the large spectral
scale model: (i) a constant plus power law model of the form
$q_{0}+q_{1}(\nu/\nu_{0})^{b_{1}}$ for two values of $b_{1}$: $b_{1} =
<\beta>_\mathrm{GDSE}$ and $b_{1} = <\beta>_\mathrm{EGS}$, the mean spectral
indices of the Galactic diffuse synchrotron emission and extragalactic source
foreground emission, respectively, and (ii) a constant plus double power law
model of the form $q_{0}+q_{1}(\nu/\nu_{0})^{b_{1}}+q_{2}(\nu/\nu_{0})^{b_{2}}$
with $b_{1} = <\beta>_\mathrm{GDSE}$ and $b_{2} = <\beta>_\mathrm{EGS}$. We
estimate the EoR power spectrum from simulated interferometric data consisting
of an EoR signal, Galactic diffuse synchrotron emission, extragalactic sources
and diffuse free-free emission from the Galaxy. We show that, by jointly
estimating a model of the EoR signal with the constant plus double power law
parametrisation of the large spectral scale model, unbiased estimates of the
EoR power spectrum are recoverable on all spatial scales accessible in the data
set, including on the large spatial scales that were found to be contaminated
in earlier work.

Title:Extraction of globular clusters members with Gaia DR2 astrometry,"
Abstract:  In this work we present a method to identify possible members of globular
clusters using data from Gaia DR2. The method consists of two stages: the first
one based on a clustering algorithm, and the second one based on the analysis
of the projected spatial distribution of stars with different proper motions.
In order to confirm that the clusters members extracted by the method
correspond to actual globular clusters, the spatial distribution, the vector
point diagram of the proper motions and the colour-magnitude diagrams are
analysed. We apply the developed method to eight clusters: NGC 1261, NGC 3201,
NGC 6139, NGC 6205, NGC 6362, NGC 6397, NGC 6712 and Palomar 13; we show the
number of members extracted, the mean proper motions derived from them and
finally we compare our results with other authors. In order to analyse the
efficiency of the extraction method we perform an estimation of the
completeness and the degree of contamination of the extracted members.

Title:Small Solar System Bodies as granular media,"
Abstract:  Asteroids and other Small Solar System Bodies (SSSBs) are of high general and
scientific interest in many aspects. The origin, formation, and evolution of
our Solar System (and other planetary systems) can be better understood by
analysing the constitution and physical properties of small bodies in the Solar
System. Currently, two space missions (Hayabusa2, OSIRIS-REx) have recently
arrived at their respective targets and will bring a sample of the asteroids
back to Earth. Other small body missions have also been selected by, or
proposed to, space agencies. The threat posed to our planet by near-Earth
objects (NEOs) is also considered at the international level, and this has
prompted dedicated research on possible mitigation techniques. The DART
mission, for example, will test the kinetic impact technique. Even ideas for
industrial exploitation have risen during the last years. Lastly, the origin of
water and life on Earth appears to be connected to asteroids. Hence, future
space mission projects will undoubtedly target some asteroids or other SSSBs.
In all these cases and research topics, specific knowledge of the structure and
mechanical behaviour of the surface as well as the bulk of those celestial
bodies is crucial. In contrast to large telluric planets and dwarf planets, a
large proportion of such small bodies is believed to consist of gravitational
aggregates ('rubble piles') with no -- or low -- internal cohesion, with
varying macro-porosity and surface properties (from smooth regolith covered
terrain, to very rough collection of boulders), and varying topography
(craters, depressions, ridges) [...].

Title:Nonlinear structure formation in Bound Dark Energy,"
Abstract:  We study nonlinear structure formation in the Bound Dark Energy model (BDE),
where dark energy (DE) corresponds to a light scalar meson particle $\phi$
dynamically formed at a condensation energy scale $\Lambda_c$. The evolution of
this dark-energy meson is determined by the potential
$V(\phi)=\Lambda_c^{4+2/3}\phi^{-2/3}$, with a distinguishing phenomenology
from other quintessence scenarios. Particularly, the expansion rate of the
universe is affected not only at late times, but also when the condensation of
$\phi$ occurs, which in linear theory leads to an enhancement (with respect to
standard $\Lambda$CDM) of matter perturbations on small scales. We study how
much of this signature is still present at late times as well as the properties
of dark matter halos in the nonlinear regime through N-body simulations. Our
results show that nonlinear corrections wash out this feature from the matter
power spectrum even before DE becomes dominant. There is, however, a small but
clear suppression of the BDE spectrum of $2\%$ today on the largest scales due
to the distinct late-time dynamics of DE. The differences on the clustering
power between BDE and $\Lambda$CDM are reflected in the halo mass function,
where small halos are more abundant in BDE as opposed to large heavy
structures, whose formation is delayed because of the expansion history of the
universe. This result is well captured by the semi-analytical Sheth-Tormen
formula. However, despite these differences, the halo concentration parameter
is essentially the same in both models, which suggest that clustering inside
the halos decouple from the general expansion once the halos form.

Title:Final Masses of Giant Planets III: Effect of Photoevaporation and a New Planetary Migration Model,"
Abstract:  We herein develop a new simple model for giant planet formation, which
predicts the final mass of a giant planet born in a given disk, by adding the
disk mass loss due to photoevaporation and a new type II migration formula to
our previous model. The proposed model provides some interesting results.
First, it gives universal evolution tracks in the diagram of planetary mass and
orbital radius, which clarifies how giant planets migrate at growth in the
runaway gas accretion stage. Giant planets with a few Jupiter masses or less
suffer only a slight radial migration in the runaway gas accretion stage.
Second, the final mass of giant planets is approximately given as a function of
only three parameters: the initial disk mass at the starting time of runaway
gas accretion onto the planet, the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation, and
the starting time. On the other hand, the final planet mass is almost
independent of the disk radius, viscosity, and initial orbital radius. The
obtained final planet mass is similar to or less than 10% of the initial disk
mass. Third, the proposed model successfully explains properties in the mass
distribution of giant exoplanets with the mass distribution of observed
protoplanetary disks for a reasonable range of the mass loss rate due to
photoevaporation.

Title:Search for transient variations of the fine structure constant and dark matter using fiber-linked optical atomic clocks,"
Abstract:  We search for transient variations of the fine structure constant using data
from a European network of fiber-linked optical atomic clocks. By searching for
coherent variations in the recorded clock frequency comparisons across the
network, we significantly improve the constraints on transient variations of
the fine structure constant. For example, we constrain the variation in alpha
to <5*10^-17 for transients of duration 10^3 s. This analysis also presents a
possibility to search for dark matter, the mysterious substance hypothesised to
explain galaxy dynamics and other astrophysical phenomena that is thought to
dominate the matter density of the universe. At the current sensitivity level,
we find no evidence for dark matter in the form of topological defects (or,
more generally, any macroscopic objects), and we thus place constraints on
certain potential couplings between the dark matter and standard model
particles, substantially improving upon the existing constraints, particularly
for large (>~10^4 km) objects.

Title:Are Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies powered by low mass black holes?,"
Abstract:  Narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are believed to be powered by
accretion of matter onto low mass black holes (BHs) in spiral host galaxies
with BH masses M_BH of 10^6 - 10^8 M_sun . However, the broad band spectral
energy distribution of the gamma-ray emitting NLS1s are found to be similar to
flat spectrum radio quasars. This challenges our current notion of NLS1s having
low M_BH . To resolve this tension of low M_BH values in NLS1s, we fitted the
observed optical spectrum of a sample of radio-loud NLS1s (RL-NLS1s),
radio-quiet NLS1s (RQ-NLS1s) and radio-quiet broad line Seyfert 1 galaxies
(RQ-BLS1s) of about 500 each with the standard Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk
(AD) model. For RL-NLS1s we found a mean log(M_ADBH/M_sun) of 7.98 +/- 0.54.
For RQ-NLS1s and RQ-BLS1s we found mean log(M_ADBH/M_sun) of 8.00 +/- 0.43 and
7.90 +/- 0.57, respectively. While the derived M_BH values of RQ-BLS1s are
similar to their virial masses, for NLS1s the derived M_ADBH values are about
an order of magnitude larger than their virial estimates. Our analysis thus
indicates that NLS1s have M_BH similar to RQ-BLS1s and their available virial
M_BH values are underestimated influenced by their observed relatively small
emission line widths. Considering Eddington ratio as an estimation of the
accretion rate and using M_ADBH, we found the mean accretion rate of our
RQ-NLS1s, RL-NLS1s and RQ-BLS1s as 0.06 (+0.16, -0.05), 0.05 (+0.18, -0.04) and
0.05 (+0.15, -0.04) respectively. Our results therefore suggest that NLS1s have
BH masses and accretion rates similar to BLS1s.

Title:Calibrating the standard candles with strong lensing,"
Abstract:  We propose a new model-independent strategy to calibrate the distance
relation in Type Ia supernova (SN) observations and to probe the intrinsic
properties of SNe Ia, especially the absolute magnitude $M_B$, basing on strong
lensing observations in the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)
era. The strongly lensed quasars can provide the Time Delay Distances (TDD) and
the Angular Diameter Distances (ADD) to the lens galaxies. These absolute
distance measurements can model-independently anchor the SNe Ia at cosmological
distances. We simulated 55 high-quality lensing systems with $5\%$
uncertainties for both TDD and ADD measurements basing on future observation
conditions. For the time delay distances and the angular diameter distances as
the calibration standards, the calibrated $1\sigma$ uncertainties of $M_{B}$
are approximately 0.24 mag and 0.03 mag, respectively. Besides, we also
consider an evolving distance relation, for example, caused by the cosmic
opacity. In this case, the $1\sigma$ uncertainties of $M_B$ calibrated with TDD
and ADD are approximately 0.31 mag and 0.06 mag, respectively. The results show
that the ADD method will be a promising tool for calibrating supernovae.

Title:Polarization reversal of scattered thermal dust emission in protoplanetary disks at (sub-)mm wavelengths,"
Abstract:  The investigation of polarized light of protoplanetary disks is key for
constraining the dust properties, disk morphology and embedded magnetic fields.
However, different polarization mechanisms and the diversity of dust grain
shapes and compositions lead to ambiguities in the polarization pattern. The
so-called ""self-scattering"" of thermal, re-emitted radiation in the infrared
and mm/submm is discussed as a major polarization mechanism. If the net flux of
the radiation field is in radial direction, it is commonly assumed that the
polarization pattern produced by scattering in a protoplanetary disk shows
concentric rings for disks seen in face-on orientation. We show that a flip of
$90^\circ$ of the polarization vectors may occur and mimic the typical pattern
of dichroic emission of dust grains aligned by a toroidal magnetic field in
disks seen close to face-on. Furthermore, this effect of polarization reversal
is a fast changing function of wavelength and grain size, and thus a powerful
tool to constrain grain composition and size distribution present in
protoplanetary disks. In addition, the effect may also provide unique
constraints for the disk inclination, especially if the disk is seen close to
face-on.

likely originate from a system of interacting star-forming galaxies that might
host a quasar(s). We also report the detection of a new emission line from the

Title:Ambipolar diffusion and the molecular abundances in prestellar cores,"
Abstract:  We investigate differences in the molecular abundances between magnetically
super- and sub-critical prestellar cores, performing three-dimensional
non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations with varying densities and
magnetic field strengths, and post-processing the results with a time-dependent
gas-grain chemical code. Most molecular species show significantly more central
depletion in subcritical models, due to the longer duration of collapse.
However, the directly observable quantities - the molecule to hydrogen column
density ratios - are generally too similar for observational data to
discriminate between models. The profiles of N$_2$H$^+$ and HCO$^+$ show
qualitative differences between supercritical and subcritical models on scales
of $0.01 \, {\rm pc}$, which may allow the two cases to be distinguished.
However, this requires knowledge of the hydrogen column density, which is not
directly measureable, and predicted line intensity profiles from radiative
transfer modelling are similar for these molecules. Other commonly observed
species, such as HCN and CH$_3$OH, have line intensity profiles which differ
more strongly between models, and so are more promising as tracers of the
mechanism of cloud collapse.

Title:The need for active region disconnection in 3D kinematic dynamo simulations,"
Abstract:  In this paper we address a discrepancy between the surface flux evolution in
a 3D kinematic dynamo model and a 2D surface flux transport model that has been
closely calibrated to the real Sun. We demonstrate that the difference is due
to the connectivity of active regions to the toroidal field at the base of the
convection zone, which is not accounted for in the surface-only model.
Initially, we consider the decay of a single active region, firstly in a
simplified Cartesian 2D model and subsequently the full 3D model. By varying
the turbulent diffusivity profile in the convection zone, we find that
increasing the diffusivity - so that active regions are more rapidly
disconnected from the base of the convection zone - improves the evolution of
the surface field. However, if we simulate a full solar cycle, we find that the
dynamo is unable to sustain itself under such an enhanced diffusivity. This
suggests that in order to accurately model the solar cycle, we must find an
alternative way to disconnect emerging active regions, whilst conserving
magnetic flux.

Title:Envelopes of embedded super-Earths II. Three-dimensional isothermal simulations,"
Abstract:  Massive planetary cores embedded in protoplanetary discs are believed to
accrete extended atmospheres, providing a pathway to forming gas giants and
gas-rich super-Earths. The properties of these atmospheres strongly depend on
the nature of the coupling between the atmosphere and the surrounding disc. We
examine the formation of gaseous envelopes around massive planetary cores via
three-dimensional inviscid and isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We focus
the changes in the envelope properties as the core mass varies from low
(sub-thermal) to high (super-thermal) values, a regime relevant to close-in
super-Earths. We show that global envelope properties such as the amount of
rotational support or turbulent mixing are mostly sensitive to the ratio of the
Bondi radius of the core to its physical size. High-mass cores are fed by
supersonic inflows arriving along the polar axis and shocking on the densest
parts of the envelope, driving turbulence and mass accretion. Gas flows out of
the core's Hill sphere in the equatorial plane, describing a global mass
circulation through the envelope. The shell of shocked gas atop the core
surface delimits regions of slow (inside) and fast (outside) material recycling
by gas from the surrounding disc. While recycling hinders the runaway growth
towards gas giants, the inner regions of protoplanetary atmospheres, more
immune to mixing, may remain bound to the planet.

Title:A statistical study of long-term evolution of coronal hole properties as observed by SDO,"
Abstract:  The study of the evolution of coronal holes (CHs) is especially important in
the context of high-speed solar wind streams (HSS) emanating from them. Stream
interaction regions may deliver large amount of energy into the Earths system,
cause geomagnetic storms, and shape interplanetary space. By statistically
analysing 16 long-living CHs observed by the SDO, we focus on coronal,
morphological and underlying photospheric magnetic field characteristics as
well as investigate the evolution of the associated HSSs. We use CATCH to
extract and analyse CHs using observations taken by AIA and HMI. We derive
changes in the CH properties and correlate them to the CH evolution. Further we
analyse the properties of the HSS signatures near 1au from OMNI data by
manually extracting the peak bulk velocity of the solar wind plasma. We find
that the area evolution of CHs mostly shows a rough trend of growing to a
maximum followed by a decay. No correlation of the area evolution to the
evolution of the signed magnetic flux and signed magnetic flux density enclosed
in the projected CH area was found. From this we conclude that the magnetic
flux within the extracted CH boundaries is not the main cause for its area
evolution. We derive CH area change rates (growth and decay) of 14.2 +/- 15.0 *
10^8 km^2/day showing a reasonable anti-correlation (cc =-0.48) to the solar
activity, approximated by the sunspot number. The change rates of the signed
mean magnetic flux density (27.3 +/- 32.2 mG/day) and the signed magnetic flux
(30.3 +/- 31.5 * 10^18 Mx/day) were also found to be dependent on solar
activity (cc =0.50 and cc =0.69 respectively) rather than on the individual CH
evolutions. Further we find that the CH area-to-HSS peak velocity relation is
valid for each CH over its evolution but revealing significant variations in
the slopes of the regression lines.

Abstract:  The evolution of contact binary star systems in mass asymmetry (transfer)
coordinate is considered. The orbital period changes is explained by an
evolution in mass asymmetry towards the symmetry (symmetrization of binary
system). It is predicted that a decreasing and an increasing orbital periods
are related, respectively, with the non-overlapping and overlapping stage of
the binary star during its symmetrization. A huge amount of energy $\Delta
U\approx 10^{41}$ J is converted from the potential energy into internal energy
of the stars during the symmetrization. As shown, the merger of stars in the
binary systems, including KIC 9832227, is energetically an unfavorable process.
The sensitivity of the calculated results to the values of total mass and
orbital angular momentum is analyzed.

cosmology, towards the next two decades, we give an universal limitation
$\Delta\gamma<8.24\times10^{-22}$ from photons with different energies emitted

scenario of this asymmetric velocity structure is caused by the mechanisms
generated in-plane, rather than vertical perturbations.

metal-poor regime, [Fe/H] $\lesssim -1$. The NLTE [Fe/H] values are
systematically higher, whereas the average NLTE [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios are
$\sim 0.15$ dex lower, compared to LTE. Our LTE measurements of metallicities

Abstract:  Light pollution poses a growing threat to optical astronomy, in addition to
its detrimental impacts on the natural environment, the intangible heritage of
humankind related to the contemplation of the starry sky and, potentially, on
human health. The computation of maps showing the spatial distribution of
several light pollution related functions (e.g. the anthropogenic zenithal
night sky brightness, or the average brightness of the celestial hemisphere) is
a key tool for light pollution monitoring and control, providing the scientific
rationale for the adoption of informed decisions on public lighting and
astronomical site preservation. The calculation of such maps from satellite
radiance data for wide regions of the planet with sub-kilometric spatial
resolution often implies a huge amount of basic pixel operations, requiring in
many cases extremely large computation times. In this paper we show that, using
adequate geographical projections, a wide set of light pollution map
calculations can be reframed in terms of two-dimensional convolutions that can
be easily evaluated using conventional fast Fourier-transform (FFT) algorithms,
with typical computation times smaller than 10^-6 s per output pixel.

Title:Ice Giant Circulation Patterns: Implications for Atmospheric Probes,"
Abstract:  Atmospheric circulation patterns derived from multi-spectral remote sensing
can serve as a guide for choosing a suitable entry site for a future in situ
probe mission. Since the Voyager-2 flybys in the 1980s, three decades of
observations from ground- and space-based observatories have generated a
picture of Ice Giant circulation that is complex, perplexing, and altogether
unlike that seen on the Gas Giants. This review seeks to reconcile the various
competing circulation patterns from an observational perspective, accounting
for spatially-resolved measurements of: zonal albedo contrasts and banded
appearances; cloud-tracked zonal winds; temperature and para-H$_2$ measurements
above the condensate clouds; and equator-to-pole contrasts in condensable
volatiles (methane and hydrogen sulphide) in the deeper troposphere. These
observations identify three distinct latitude domains: an equatorial domain of
deep upwelling and upper-tropospheric subsidence, potentially bounded by peaks
in the retrograde zonal jet and analogous to Jovian cyclonic belts; a
mid-latitude transitional domain of upper-tropospheric upwelling, vigorous
cloud activity, analogous to Jovian anticyclonic zones; and a polar domain of
strong subsidence, volatile depletion, and small-scale (and potentially
seasonally-variable) convective activity. Taken together, the multi-wavelength
observations suggest a tiered structure of stacked circulation cells (at least
two in the troposphere and one in the stratosphere), potentially separated in
the vertical by (i) strong molecular weight gradients associated with cloud
condensation, and by (ii) transitions from a thermally-direct circulation
regime at depth to a wave-driven circulation regime at high altitude. The
inferred circulation can be tested in the coming decade by 3D simulations and
by observations from future world-class facilities. [Abridged]

weather research to understand solar flares to the point of being able to
forecast them. As data and algorithms improve dramatically, questions must be
asked concerning how well the forecasting performs; crucially, we must ask how
to rigorously measure performance in order to critically gauge any
improvements. Building upon earlier-developed methodology (Barnes et al, 2016,
Paper I), international representatives of regional warning centers and
research facilities assembled in 2017 at the Institute for Space-Earth
Environmental Research, Nagoya University, Japan to - for the first time -
directly compare the performance of operational solar flare forecasting
methods. Multiple quantitative evaluation metrics are employed, with focus and
discussion on evaluation methodologies given the restrictions of operational
forecasting. Numerous methods performed consistently above the ""no skill""
level, although which method scored top marks is decisively a function of flare
event definition and the metric used; there was no single winner. Following in
this paper series we ask why the performances differ by examining
implementation details (Leka et al. 2019, Paper III), and then we present a
novel analysis method to evaluate temporal patterns of forecasting errors in
(Park et al. 2019, Paper IV). With these works, this team presents a
well-defined and robust methodology for evaluating solar flare forecasting
methods in both research and operational frameworks, and today's performance
benchmarks against which improvements and new methods may be compared.

Title:A Comparison of Flare Forecasting Methods. III. Systematic Behaviors of Operational Solar Flare Forecasting Systems,"
Abstract:  A workshop was recently held at Nagoya University (31 October - 02 November
2017), sponsored by the Center for International Collaborative Research, at the
Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, Japan, to
quantitatively compare the performance of today's operational solar flare
forecasting facilities. Building upon Paper I of this series (Barnes et al.
2016), in Paper II (Leka et al. 2019) we described the participating methods
for this latest comparison effort, the evaluation methodology, and presented
quantitative comparisons. In this paper we focus on the behavior and
performance of the methods when evaluated in the context of broad
implementation differences. Acknowledging the short testing interval available
and the small number of methods available, we do find that forecast
performance: 1) appears to improve by including persistence or prior flare
activity, region evolution, and a human ""forecaster in the loop""; 2) is hurt by
restricting data to disk-center observations; 3) may benefit from long-term
statistics, but mostly when then combined with modern data sources and
statistical approaches. These trends are arguably weak and must be viewed with
numerous caveats, as discussed both here and in Paper II. Following this
present work, we present in Paper IV a novel analysis method to evaluate
temporal patterns of forecasting errors of both types (i.e., misses and false
alarms; Park et al. 2019). Hence, most importantly, with this series of papers
we demonstrate the techniques for facilitating comparisons in the interest of
establishing performance-positive methodologies.

Title:The effect of hyperfine splitting on Stark broadening for three blue-green Cu I lines in laser-induced plasma,"
Abstract:  Stark effect is observed in many natural and artificial plasmas and is of
great importance for diagnostic purposes. Since this effect alters profiles of
spectral lines, it should be taken into account when assessing chemical
composition of radiation sources, including stars. Copper is one of the
elements which studies of stellar atmospheres deal with. To this end, UV and
visible Cu lines are used. However, there is a lack of agreement between
existing data on their Stark parameters. It is therefore of interest to obtain
new experimental data on these lines and to compare them to previous results.
In this work, we have estimated Stark widths and shifts for three blue-green
lines at 5105.54, 5153.24, and 5218.20 A (corresponding transitions are
[3d104p] 2P - [3d94s2] 2D and [3d104d] 2D - [3d104p] 2P) observed
in a ""long-spark"" laser-induced plasma. For the first time, we have accurately
estimated an impact of hyperfine splitting on the profile shapes of the studied
lines taking also into account the isotope shifts. We have shown that both
effects considerably influence shift and width of Cu I line at 5105.54 A, and
shifts of Cu I lines at 5153.24 and 5218.20 A.

Title:Propagation of star formation at sub-kiloparsec scales,"
Abstract:  We study the propagation of star formation based on the investigation of the
separation of young star clusters from HII regions nearest to them. The
relation between the separation and U-B colour index (or age) of a star cluster
was found. The average age of star clusters increases with the separation as
the 1.0-1.2 power in the separation range from 40 to 200 pc and as the 0.4-0.9
power in the range of 100-500 pc in the galaxies with symmetric morphology. The
galaxies with distorted asymmetric disc structure show more complex and steeper
(power >1.2 at separations from 40 to 500 pc) dependence between the age and
the separation. Our results confirm the findings of previous studies on the
dominant role of turbulence in propagation of the star formation process on
spatial scales up to 500 pc and on time scales up to 300 Myr. On a smaller
scale (=<100 pc), other physical processes, such as stellar winds and supernova
explosions, play an important role along with turbulence. On the scale of
stellar associations (100-200 pc and smaller), the velocity of star formation
propagation is almost constant and it has a typical value of a few km/s.

inflation \cite{Chen:2009zp, Chen:2009we}, in which the couplings between

Title:UV regulated star formation in high-redshift galaxies,"
Abstract:  The first galaxies forming a few hundred million years after the Big Bang are
the key drivers of cosmic evolution and ideal laboratories to study theories of
galaxy formation. We here study the role of UV radiation in suppressing star
formation in primordial galaxies by destroying molecular hydrogen, the main
coolant in primordial gas and provide estimates of cold dense gas at the onset
of star formation. To accomplish this goal, we perform three dimensional
cosmological simulations of minihalos in different environments forming at $
z\sim 25$ by varying strength of background UV flux below the Lyman limit
between 0.01-1000 in units of $\rm J_{21}=10^{-21}~erg/cm^2/s/Hz/sr$.
Particularly, we include photo-detachment of $\rm H^-$, the self-shielding of
$\rm H_2$ which both were neglected in previous studies and use updated
reaction rates. Our results show that depending on the background level $\rm
H_2$ formation is suppressed, delaying gravitational collapse until halos reach
the atomic cooling limit. We find that the formation of cold dense molecular
gas and subsequently star formation gets delayed by 100 to 230 Myr depending on
the level of the background radiation and the growth history of the dark matter
halos. The fraction of dense self-shielded gas is a strong function of the
background flux and exponentially declines with the strength of incident UV
flux above $\rm J_{21} \geq 1$. We find that taking into account $\rm H_2$
self-shielding is crucial for accurately estimating the amount of cold dense
gas available for star formation.

Title:Ice Giant Systems: The Scientific Potential of Orbital Missions to Uranus and Neptune,"
Abstract:  Uranus and Neptune, and their diverse satellite and ring systems, represent
the least explored environments of our Solar System, and yet may provide the
archetype for the most common outcome of planetary formation throughout our
galaxy. Ice Giants will be the last remaining class of Solar System planet to
have a dedicated orbital explorer, and international efforts are under way to
realise such an ambitious mission in the coming decades. In 2019, the European
Space Agency released a call for scientific themes for its strategic science
planning process for the 2030s and 2040s, known as Voyage 2050. We used this
opportunity to review our present-day knowledge of the Uranus and Neptune
systems, producing a revised and updated set of scientific questions and
motivations for their exploration. This review article describes how such a
mission could explore their origins, ice-rich interiors, dynamic atmospheres,
unique magnetospheres, and myriad icy satellites, to address questions at the
heart of modern planetary science. These two worlds are superb examples of how
planets with shared origins can exhibit remarkably different evolutionary
paths: Neptune as the archetype for Ice Giants, whereas Uranus may be atypical.
Exploring Uranus' natural satellites and Neptune's captured moon Triton could
reveal how Ocean Worlds form and remain active, redefining the extent of the
habitable zone in our Solar System. For these reasons and more, we advocate
that an Ice Giant System explorer should become a strategic cornerstone mission
within ESA's Voyage 2050 programme, in partnership with international
collaborators, and targeting launch opportunities in the early 2030s.

Title:Beyond UVJ: More Efficient Selection of Quiescent Galaxies With UV / Mid-IR Fluxes,"
Abstract:  The UVJ color-color diagram is a popular and efficient method to distinguish
between quiescent and star-forming galaxies through their rest-frame $U-V$ vs.
$V-J$ colors. Here we explore the information content of this color-color space
using the Bayesian inference machine Prospector. We fit the same physical model
to two datasets: (i) UVJ fluxes alone, and (ii) full UV-mid IR (MIR) broadband
SEDs from the 3D-HST survey. Notably this model uses both nonparametric SFHs
and a flexible dust attenuation curve, both of which have the potential to
`break' the typical correlations observed in UVJ color-color space. Instead,
these fits confirm observed trends between UVJ colors and observed galaxy
properties, including specific star formation rate (sSFR), dust attenuation,
stellar age, and stellar metallicity. They also demonstrate that UVJ colors do
not, on their own, constrain stellar age or metallicity; the observed trends in
the UVJ diagram are instead driven by galaxy scaling relationships and thus
will evolve with cosmological time. We also show that UVJ colors 'saturate'
below $\log(\mathrm{sSFR/yr}^{-1})\lesssim -10.5$, i.e. changing sSFR no longer
produces substantial changes in UVJ colors. We show that far-UV and/or MIR
fluxes continue to correlate with sSFR down to low sSFRs and can be used in
color-color diagrams to efficiently target galaxies with much lower levels of
ongoing star formation. We provide selection criteria in these new color-color
spaces as a function of desired sample sSFR.

Title:Dynamical Properties of Molecular-forming Gas Clumps in Galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization,"
Abstract:  We study the properties of molecular-forming gas clumps (MGCs) at the epoch
of reionization using cosmological zoom-in simulations. We identify MGCs in a
z=6 prototypical galaxy (""Althaea"") using an H2 density-based clump finder. We
compare their mass, size, velocity dispersion, gas surface density, and virial
parameter (alpha_vir) to observations. In Althaea, the typical MGC mass and
size are Mgas=10^6.5 Msun and R=45-100 pc, which are comparable to those found
in nearby spirals and starburst galaxies. MGCs are highly supersonic and
supported by turbulence, with rms velocity dispersions of sigma_gas=20-100 km
s^-1 and pressure of P/k_B=10^7.6 K cm^-3 (i.e., >1000x with respect to the
Milky Way), similar to those found in nearby and z~2 gas-rich starburst
galaxies. In addition, we perform stability analysis to understand the origin
and dynamical properties of MGCs. We find that MGCs are globally stable in the
main disk of Althaea. Densest regions where star formation is expected to take
place in clouds and cores on even smaller scales instead have lower alpha_vir
and Toomre-Q values. Detailed studies of the star-forming gas dynamics at the
epoch of reionization thus require a spatial resolution of <40 pc (=0.01""),
which is within reach with the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array and the
Next Generation Very Large Array.

Title:Inferring high redshift large-scale structure dynamics from the Lyman-alpha forest,"
Abstract:  One of the major science goals over the coming decade is to test fundamental
physics with probes of the cosmic large-scale structure out to high redshift.
Here we present a fully Bayesian approach to infer the three-dimensional cosmic
matter distribution and its dynamics at $z>2$ from observations of the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We demonstrate that the method recovers the unbiased
mass distribution and the correct matter power spectrum at all scales. Our
method infers the three-dimensional density field from a set of one-dimensional
spectra, interpolating the information between the lines of sight. We show that
our algorithm provides unbiased mass profiles of clusters, becoming an
alternative for estimating cluster masses complementary to weak lensing or
X-ray observations. The algorithm employs a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to
generate realizations of initial and evolved density fields and the
three-dimensional large-scale flow, revealing the cosmic dynamics at high
redshift. The method correctly handles multi-modal parameter distributions,
which allow constraining the physics of the intergalactic medium (IGM) with
high accuracy. We performed several tests using realistic simulated quasar
spectra to test and validate our method. Our results show that detailed and
physically plausible inference of three-dimensional large-scale structures at
high redshift has become feasible.

Title:Constraints on the growth rate using the observed galaxy power spectrum,"
Abstract:  The large-scale structure growth index $\gamma$ provides a consistency test
of the standard cosmology and is a potential indicator of modified gravity. We
investigate the constraints on $\gamma$ from next-generation spectroscopic
surveys, using the power spectrum that is observed in redshift space, i.e., the
angular power spectrum. The angular power spectrum avoids the need for an
Alcock-Packzynski correction. It also naturally incorporates cosmic evolution
and wide-angle effects, without any approximation. We include the
cross-correlations between redshift bins, using a hybrid approximation when the
total number of bins is computationally unfeasible. We show that the
signal-to-noise on $\gamma$ increases as the redshift bin-width is decreased.
Noise per bin also increases -- but this is compensated by the increased number
of auto- and cross-spectra. In our forecasts, we marginalise over the amplitude
of primordial fluctuations and other standard cosmological parameters,
including the dark energy equation of state parameter, as well as the
clustering bias. Neglecting cross-bin correlations increases the errors by
$\sim40 - 150\%$. Using only linear scales, we find that a DESI-like BGS survey
and an HI intensity mapping survey with the SKA1 precursor MeerKAT deliver
similar errors of $\sim4-6\%$, while a Euclid-like survey and an SKA1 intensity
mapping survey give $\sim3\%$ errors.

Title:Realistic simulations of galaxy formation in f(R) modified gravity,"
Abstract:  We have carried out a set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that
follow galaxy formation in $f(R)$ modified gravity models. Our simulations
employ the Illustris-TNG full physics model and a new modified gravity solver
in the AREPO code. For the first time we are able to investigate the degeneracy
in the matter power spectrum between the effects of $f(R)$-gravity and feedback
from active galactic nuclei (AGN), and the imprint of modified gravity on the
properties of galaxies and on the distribution of dark matter, gas and stars in
the universe. $f(R)$-gravity has an observable effect on the neutral hydrogen
power spectrum at high redshift at a level of 20%. For both the F6 and F5
models, this is significantly larger than the predicted errors for the SKA1-MID
survey, making this probe a powerful test of gravity on large scales. A similar
effect is present in the power spectrum of the stars at high redshift. We also
show that rotationally supported disc galaxies can form in $f(R)$-gravity, even
in the partially screened regime. Our simulations indicate that there might be
more disc galaxies in F6 compared to GR, and fewer in F5. Finally, we show that
the back reaction between AGN feedback and modified gravity in the matter power
spectrum is not important in the F6 model but has a sizeable effect in F5.

Title:Planetary Magnetic Field Control of Ion Escape from Weakly Magnetized Planets,"
Abstract:  Intrinsic magnetic fields have long been thought to shield planets from
atmospheric erosion via stellar winds; however, the influence of the plasma
environment on atmospheric escape is complex. Here we study the influence of a
weak intrinsic dipolar planetary magnetic field on the plasma environment and
subsequent ion escape from a Mars sized planet in a global three-dimensional
hybrid simulation. We find that increasing the strength of a planet's magnetic
field enhances ion escape until the magnetic dipole's standoff distance reaches
the induced magnetosphere boundary. After this point increasing the planetary
magnetic field begins to inhibit ion escape. This reflects a balance between
shielding of the southern hemisphere from ``misaligned"" ion pickup forces and
trapping of escaping ions by an equatorial plasmasphere. Thus, the planetary
magnetic field associated with the peak ion escape rate is critically dependent
on the stellar wind pressure. Where possible we have fit power laws for the
variation of fundamental parameters (escape rate, escape power, polar cap
opening angle and effective interaction area) with magnetic field, and assessed
upper and lower limits for the relationships.

Title:Dark and luminous satellites of LMC-mass galaxies in the FIRE simulations,"
Abstract:  Within $\Lambda$CDM, dwarf galaxies like the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are
expected to host numerous dark matter subhalos, several of which should host
faint dwarf companions. Recent Gaia proper motions confirm new members of the
LMC-system in addition to the previously known SMC, including two classical
dwarf galaxies ($M_\ast$ > $10^5$ M$_{\odot}$; Carina and Fornax) as well as
several ultra-faint dwarfs (Car2, Car3, Hor1, and Hyd1). We use the Feedback In
Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations to study the dark and luminous (down
to ultrafaint masses, $M_\ast$ ~ $6\times10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) substructure
population of isolated LMC-mass hosts ($M_\text{200}$ = $1-3\times10^{11}$
M$_{\odot}$) and place the Gaia + DES results in a cosmological context. By
comparing number counts of subhalos in simulations with and without baryons, we
find that, within 0.2 $r_\text{200}$, LMC-mass hosts deplete ~30% of their
substructure, significantly lower than the ~70% of substructure depleted by
Milky Way (MW) mass hosts. For our highest resolution runs ($m_\text{bary}$ =
880 M$_{\odot}$), ~5-10 subhalos form galaxies with $M_\ast$ > $10^4$
M$_{\odot}$, in agreement with the 7 observationally inferred pre-infall LMC
companions. However, we find steeper simulated luminosity functions than
observed, hinting at observation incompleteness at the faint end. The predicted
DM content for classical satellites in FIRE agrees with observed estimates for
Carina and Fornax, supporting the case for an LMC association. We predict that
tidal stripping within the LMC potential lowers the inner dark matter density
of ultra faint companions of the LMC. Thus, in addition to their orbital
consistency, the low densities of dwarfs Car2, Hyd1, and Hyd2 reinforce their
likelihood of Magellanic association.

Abstract:  We present an analysis of the matter, halo and galaxy clustering in

suite. Our analysis focuses on the interplay between baryonic feedback and
$f(R)$-gravity in the matter power spectrum, the matter and halo correlation
functions, the halo and galaxy-host-halo mass function, the subhalo and
satellite-galaxy count and the correlation function of the stars in our

simulations in $f(R)$-gravity show, that it will be very difficult to derive
accurate fitting formulae for the power spectrum enhancement in $f(R)$-gravity

function due to $f(R)$-gravity and its suppression due to feedback effects do
not show significant back-reaction effects and can thus be estimated from
independent GR-hydro and $f(R)$ dark matter only simulations. Our simulations
furthermore show, that the number of subhalos and satellite-galaxies per halo
is not significantly affected by $f(R)$-gravity. Low mass halos are
nevertheless more likely to be populated by galaxies in $f(R)$-gravity. This
suppresses the clustering of stars and the galaxy correlation function in the
theory compared to standard cosmology.

Title:High-redshift test of gravity using enhanced growth of small structures probed by the neutral hydrogen distribution,"
Abstract:  Future 21 cm intensity mapping surveys such as SKA can provide precise
information on the spatial distribution of the neutral hydrogen (HI) in the
post-reionization epoch. This information will allow to test the standard LCDM
paradigm and with that the nature of gravity. In this work, we employ the
SHYBONE simulations, which model galaxy formation in f(R) modified gravity

abundance and power spectra. We find that the enhanced growth low-mass dark
matter halos experience in f(R) gravity at high redshifts alters the HI power
spectrum and can be observable through 21 cm intensity mapping. Our results
suggest that the HI power spectrum is suppressed by 13\% on scales
$k\lesssim2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at z=2 for F6, a f(R) model which passes
most observational constraints. We show that this suppression can be detectable

Title:The Evolution of O I over 3.2 < z < 6.5: Reionization of the Circumgalactic Medium,"
Abstract:  We present a survey for metal absorption systems traced by neutral oxygen
over $3.2 < z < 6.5$. Our survey uses Keck/ESI and VLT/X-Shooter spectra of 199
QSOs with redshifts up to 6.6. In total we detect 74 O I absorbers, of which 57
are separated from the background QSO by more than 5000 km/s. We use a maximum
likelihood approach to fit the distribution of O I $\lambda$1302 equivalent
widths in bins of redshift, and from this determine the evolution in number
density of absorbers with $W_{1302} > 0.05$ angstroms. We find that the number
density does not monotonically increase with decreasing redshift, as would
naively be expected from the buildup of metal-enriched circumgalactic gas with
time. The number density over $4.9 < z < 5.7$ is a factor of 1.7--4.1 lower
(68% confidence) than over $5.7 < z < 6.5$, with a lower value at $z < 5.7$
favored with 99% confidence. This decrease suggests that the fraction of metals
in a low-ionization phase is larger at $z \sim 6$ than at lower redshifts.
Absorption from highly ionized metals traced by C IV is also weaker in
higher-redshift O I systems, supporting this picture. The evolution of O I
absorbers implies that metal-enriched circumgalactic gas at $z \sim 6$ is
undergoing an ionization transition driven by a strengthening ultraviolet
background. This in turn suggests that the reionization of the diffuse
intergalactic medium may still be ongoing at or only recently ended by this
epoch.

Title:Properties of extragalactic thick discs recovered from ultra-deep Stripe82 imaging,"

surface brightness limit of $\mu_{r_{\rm deep}} \sim$28.5$-$29~mag
arcsec$^{-2}$ with combined $g$,$r$,$i$ band images from the IAC Stripe 82
Legacy Project. We present the characterisation of the thick discs in a sample
of five edge-on galaxies. A study of the radial and vertical surface brightness
profiles is presented by comparing our data with point spread function (PSF)
deconvolved models. Our method begins with an analysis of the background and
masking processes. Then we consider the effects of the PSF through galaxy
modelling. The galaxy disc components are fitted considering that the thin and
thick discs are two stellar fluids that are gravitationally coupled in
hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that effects due to the PSF are significant
when low surface brightness is reached, especially in the vertical profiles,
but it can be accounted for by careful modelling. The galaxy outskirts are
strongly affected by the faint wings of the PSF, mainly by PSF-redistributed
light from the thin disc. This is a central problem for ultra-deep imaging. The
thick-disc component is required to reach satisfactory fit results in the more
complex galaxies in our sample, although it is not required for all galaxies.
When the PSF is ignored, the brightness of these structures may be
overestimated by up to a factor of $\sim$4. In general, our results are in good
agreement with those of previous works, although we reach deeper surface
brightness levels, so that the PSF effects are stronger. We obtain scale
heights and mass ratios of thin and thick discs ($z_{\rm t}$, $z_{\rm T}$,
and $M_{\rm T}/M_{\rm t}$), which provide excellent agreement with previous
studies. Our small initial sample provides evidence for aspects of a wide
variety of formation theories for the thick discs in disc galaxies.

Title:Mass transport in galaxy discs limits black hole growth to sub-Eddington rates,"
Abstract:  Super-massive black holes (SMBHs) observed to have masses of $M_\bullet \sim
10^9 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z\gtrsim6$, $<1$ Gyr after the Big Bang, are
thought to have been seeded by massive black holes which formed before growing
concurrently with the formation of their host galaxies. We model analytically
the idealised growth of seed black holes, fed through gas inflow from growing
proto-galaxy discs. The inflow depends on the disc gravitational stability and
thus varies with black hole and disc mass. We find that for a typical host
halo, the efficiency of angular momentum transport, as parametrised by the disc
viscosity, is the limiting factor in determining the inflow rate and the black
hole accretion rate. For our fiducial case we find an upper black hole mass
estimate of $M_\bullet \sim 1.8 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ at $z=6$.
Only in the extreme case of $\sim 10^{16}$ M$_{\odot}$ haloes at $z=6$ produces
SMBH masses of $\sim 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$. However, the number density of such
haloes is many orders of magnitude below the estimated 1 Gpc$^{-3}$ of SMBHs at
$z=6$, indicating that viscosity driven accretion is too inefficient to feed
the growth of seeds into $M_\bullet \sim 10^9 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ SMBHs by $z
\sim 6$. We demonstrate that major mergers are capable of resolving the
apparent discrepancy in black hole mass at $z=6$, with some dependence on the
exact choice of orbital parameters of the merger.

in an escape route from the mid-outer asteroid belt. Hamburg is the 14th known

Title:Partial Stellar Disruption by a Supermassive Black Hole: Is the Lightcurve Really Proportional to $t^{-9/4}$?,"
Abstract:  The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole, and the
subsequent accretion of the disrupted debris by that black hole, offers a
direct means to study the inner regions of otherwise-quiescent galaxies. These
tidal disruption events (TDEs) are being discovered at an ever-increasing rate.
We present a model for the evolution of the tidally-disrupted debris from a
partial TDE, in which a stellar core survives the initial tidal encounter and
continues to exert a gravitational influence on the expanding stream of
tidally-stripped debris. We use this model to show that the asymptotic fallback
rate of material to the black hole in a partial TDE scales as $\propto
t^{-2.26\pm0.01}$, and is effectively independent of the mass of the core that
survives the encounter; we also estimate the rate at which TDEs approach this
asymptotic scaling as a function of the core mass. These findings suggest that
the late-time accretion rate onto a black hole from a TDE either declines as
$t^{-5/3}$ if the star is completely disrupted or $t^{-9/4}$ if a core is left
behind. We emphasize that previous investigations have not recovered this
result due to the assumption of a Keplerian energy-period relationship for the
debris orbits, which is no longer valid when a surviving core generates a
time-dependent, gravitational potential. This dichotomy of fallback rates has
important implications for the characteristic signatures of TDEs in the current
era of wide-field surveys.

Title:Absolute colours and phase coefficients of trans-Neptunian objects: Correlations and Populations,"
Abstract:  The study of the visible colours of the trans-Neptunian objects opened a
discussion almost 20 years ago which, in spite of the increase in the amount of
available data, seems far from subside. Visible colours impose constraints to
the current theories of the early dynamical evolution of the Solar System such
as the environment of formation, initial surface composition, and how (if) they
were scattered to regions closer to the inner planets. In this paper we present
an updated version of our database of absolute colours and relative phase
coefficients for 117 objects. We define the absolute colours as the difference
of the absolute magnitudes $H_V-H_R$, and the relative phase coefficient as the
difference of the slopes of the phase curves $\Delta\beta$. These were obtained
joining our own observations plus data from the literature. The methodology has
been introduced in previous works and here we expand in some interesting
results, in particular the strong anti-correlation found between $H_V-H_R$ and
$\Delta\beta$, which means that redder objects have steeper phase curves in the
R filter, while bluer objects have steeper phase curves in the V filter. We
analyse a series of results published in the literature in view of our
database, which is free of phase effects, and show that their statistical
meaning is not very strong. We point out that phase-colouring and observational
errors play an important role in the understanding of these proposed
relationships.

Title:Wide-band Parametric Amplifier Readout and Resolution of Optical Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors,"
Abstract:  The energy resolution of a single photon counting Microwave Kinetic
Inductance Detector (MKID) can be degraded by noise coming from the primary low
temperature amplifier in the detector's readout system. Until recently, quantum
limited amplifiers have been incompatible with these detectors due to dynamic
range, power, and bandwidth constraints. However, we show that a kinetic
inductance based traveling wave parametric amplifier can be used for this
application and reaches the quantum limit. The total system noise for this
readout scheme was equal to ~2.1 in units of quanta. For incident photons in
the 800 to 1300 nm range, the amplifier increased the average resolving power
of the detector from ~6.7 to 9.3 at which point the resolution becomes limited
by noise on the pulse height of the signal. Noise measurements suggest that a
resolving power of up to 25 is possible if redesigned detectors can remove this
additional noise source.

Title:Galactic Gamma Ray Background from Interactions of Cosmic Rays,"
Abstract:  Various studies firmly establish the fact that gamma-ray observations can act
as a unique probe to detect the possible cosmic ray (CR) sources, study the CR
density distribution and explore the average properties of interstellar medium
(ISM) such as the gas density profile of ISM. We use the DRAGON code to study
different propagation models by incorporating realistic source distribution,
Galactic magnetic field (GMF) and gas density profile, and finally obtain the
proton distribution (both spatial and energy) in the Galaxy by fitting the
locally observed CR spectra. The uncertainties in the model parameters used to
study the CR propagation are also shown here. Our obtained proton distribution
is then used to calculate the diffuse gamma-ray flux produced by proton-proton
interactions in the Galactic halo. We compare our diffuse gamma-ray fluxes with
the previous results and the isotropic gamma-ray background (IGRB) at sub -TeV
energy regime measured by \textit{Fermi}-LAT. It is found to be much less than
IGRB, which suggests IGRB is mostly of extragalactic origin. Finally, we use
our obtained proton distribution to calculate gamma-ray fluxes from individual
Galactic Molecular Clouds (GMCs) and those fluxes are compared with the
\textit{Fermi}-LAT observations of GMCs.

Title:Formation and evolution of coronal holes during the rising phase of cycle 23,"
Abstract:  Regularities of formation of coronal holes (CH) at the rising phase of cycle
23 are investigated. The period from 01.01.1997 to 01.03.2000 (Carrington
rotations (CRs) 1918-2059) is considered in detail. The evolution of the global
magnetic field (GMF) of the Sun from the zonal to the sectorial structure is
analyzed. It is shown that the zonal structure is quasi-stable. The sum of
zonal harmonics dominated up to CR 1941, although a stable four-sector
structure of GMF was formed in 1932. In CRs 1941-1950 the contribution of the
zonal and sectorial components becomes approximately equal and from CR 1950 the
sectorial structure of GMF was dominated. Sectorial structure of GMF undergoing
sharp changes from four-sector, at the beginning of growth of the sectorial
harmonics (CR 1926), to the two-sector structure, then back to four-sector and
then again to the two-sector structure. CHs clearly trace all evolutionary
changes in the GMF. The structure of the polarity of the GMF uniquely
determines the zones of photospheric magnetic fields where the CHs are formed.

Title:Spectroscopy with the Engineering Development Array: cold H$^{+}$ at 63 MHz towards the Galactic Centre,"
Abstract:  The Engineering Development Array (EDA) is a single test station for Square
Kilometre Array (SKA) precursor technology. We have used the EDA to detect
low-frequency radio recombination lines (RRLs) from the Galactic Centre region.
Low-frequency RRLs are an area of interest for future low-frequency SKA work as
these lines provide important information on the physical properties of the
cold neutral medium. In this project we investigate the EDA, its bandpass and
the radio frequency interference environment for low-frequency spectroscopy. We
present line spectra from 30 to 325 MHz for the Galactic Centre region. The
decrease in sensitivity for the EDA at the low end of the receiver prevents
carbon and hydrogen RRLs to be detected below 40 and 60 MHz respectively. RFI
strongly affects frequencies in the range 276-292, 234-270, 131-138, 95-102 and
below 33 MHz. Cn$\alpha$ RRLs were detected in absorption for quantum levels n
= 378 to 550 (39-121 MHz) and in emission for n = 272 to 306 (228-325 MHz).
Cn$\beta$ lines were detected in absorption for n = 387 to 696 (39-225 MHz).
Hn$\alpha$ RRLs were detected in emission for n = 272 to 480 (59-325 MHz).
Hn$\beta$ lines were detected for n = 387 to 453 (141-225 MHz). The stacked
Hn$\alpha$ detection at 63 MHz is the lowest frequency detection made for
hydrogen RRLs and shows that a cold (partially) ionized medium exists along the
line of sight to the Galactic Centre region. The size and velocity of this cold
H$^{+}$ gas indicates that it is likely associated with the nearby
Riegel-Crutcher cloud.

Title:Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy: a Review,"
Abstract:  The discovery of cosmic acceleration has triggered a consistent body of
theoretical work aimed at modeling its phenomenology and understanding its
fundamental physical nature. In recent years, a powerful formalism that
accomplishes both these goals has been developed, the so-called effective field
theory of dark energy. It can capture the behavior of a wide class of modified
gravity theories and classify them according to the imprints they leave on the
smooth background expansion history of the Universe and on the evolution of
linear perturbations. The effective field theory of dark energy is based on a
Lagrangian description of cosmological perturbations which depends on a number
of functions of time, some of which are non-minimal couplings representing
genuine deviations from General Relativity. Such a formalism is thus
particularly convenient to fit and interpret the wealth of new data that will
be provided by future galaxy surveys. Despite its recent appearance, this
formalism has already allowed a systematic investigation of what lies beyond
the General Relativity landscape and provided a conspicuous amount of
theoretical predictions and observational results. In this review, we report on
these achievements.

Title:Observational signature of circumstellar interaction and $\rm ^{56}$Ni-mixing in the Type II Supernova 2016gfy,"
Abstract:  The optical and ultra-violet broadband photometric and spectroscopic
observations of the Type II supernova (SN) 2016gfy are presented. The $V$-band
light curve (LC) shows a distinct plateau phase with a slope, $s_2$ $\sim$ 0.12
mag / 100 d and a duration of 90 $\pm$ 5 d. Detailed analysis of SN 2016gfy
provided a mean $\rm^{56}Ni$ mass of 0.033 $\pm$ 0.003 $\rm M_{\odot}$, a
progenitor radius of $\sim$ 350-700 $\rm R_{\odot}$, a progenitor mass of
$\sim$ 12-15 $\rm M_{\odot}$ and an explosion energy of 0.9-1.4$\rm \times
10^{51}\ erg\ s^{-1}$. The P-Cygni profile of H$\rm \alpha$ in the early phase
spectra ($\sim$ 11-21 d) shows a boxy emission. Assuming that this profile
arises from the interaction of the SN ejecta with the pre-existing
circumstellar material (CSM), it is inferred that the progenitor underwent a
recent episode (30-80 years prior to the explosion) of enhanced mass loss.
Numerical modeling suggests that the early LC peak is reproduced better with an
existing CSM of 0.15 $\rm M_{\odot}$ spread out to $\sim$ 70 AU. A late-plateau
bump is seen in the $VRI$ LCs during $\sim$ 50-95 d. This bump is explained as
a result of the CSM interaction and/or partial mixing of radioactive $\rm
^{56}Ni$ in the SN ejecta. Using strong-line diagnostics, a sub-solar oxygen
abundance is estimated for the supernova H II region (12 + log(O/H) = 8.50
$\pm$ 0.11), indicating an average metallicity for the host of a Type II SN. A
star formation rate of $\sim$ 8.5 $\rm M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$ is estimated for NGC
2276 using the archival $GALEX$ FUV data.

Title:On the observational behaviour of the highly polarized Type IIn supernova SN 2017hcc,"
Abstract:  We present the results based on photometric ($Swift$ UVOT), broad-band
polarimetric ($V$ and $R$-band) and optical spectroscopic observations of the
Type IIn supernova (SN) 2017hcc. Our study is supplemented with
spectropolarimetric data available in literature for this event. The post-peak
light curve evolution is slow ($\sim$0.2 mag 100 d$^{-1}$ in $b$-band). The
spectrum of $\sim$+27 d shows a blue continuum with narrow emission lines,
typical of a Type IIn SN. Archival polarization data along with the $Gaia$ DR2
distances have been utilized to evaluate the interstellar polarization (ISP)
towards the SN direction which is found to be $P_{ISP}$ = 0.17 $\pm$ 0.02 per
cent and $\theta_{ISP}$ = 140$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 3$^{\circ}$. To extract the
intrinsic polarization of SN 2017hcc, both the observed and the literature
polarization measurements were corrected for ISP. We noticed a significant
decline of $\sim$3.5 per cent ($V$-band) in the intrinsic level of polarization
spanning a period of $\sim$2 months. In contrast, the intrinsic polarization
angles remain nearly constant at all epochs. Our study indicates a substantial
variation in the degree of asymmetry in either the ejecta and/or the
surrounding medium of SN 2017hcc. We also estimate a mass-loss rate of $\dot M$
= 0.12 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (for $v_w$ = 20 km s$^{-1}$) which suggests that
the progenitor of SN 2017hcc is most likely a Luminous Blue Variable.

Title:The impact of baryonic physics and massive neutrinos on weak lensing peak statistics,"
Abstract:  We study the impact of baryonic processes and massive neutrinos on weak
lensing peak statistics that can be used to constrain cosmological parameters.
We use the BAHAMAS suite of cosmological simulations, which self-consistently
include baryonic processes and the effect of massive neutrino free-streaming on
the evolution of structure formation. We construct synthetic weak lensing
catalogues by ray-tracing through light-cones, and use the aperture mass
statistic for the analysis. The peaks detected on the maps reflect the
cumulative signal from massive bound objects and general large-scale structure.
We present the first study of weak lensing peaks in simulations that include
both baryonic physics and massive neutrinos (summed neutrino mass $M_{\nu} =$
0.06, 0.12, 0.24, and 0.48 eV assuming normal hierarchy), so that the
uncertainty due to physics beyond the gravity of dark matter can be factored
into constraints on cosmological models. Assuming a fiducial model of baryonic
physics, we also investigate the correlation between peaks and massive haloes,
over a range of summed neutrino mass values. As higher neutrino mass tends to
suppress the formation of massive structures in the Universe, the halo mass
function and lensing peak counts are therefore modified as a function of
$M_{\nu}$. Over most of the S/N range, the impact of fiducial baryonic physics
is greater (less) than neutrinos for 0.06 and 0.12 (0.24 and 0.48) eV models.
Both baryonic physics and massive neutrinos should be accounted for when
deriving cosmological parameters from weak lensing observations.

Title:Inverse Compton Cascades in Pair-Producing Gaps: Effects of Triplet Pair Production,"
Abstract:  Inverse Compton-pair cascades are initiated when gamma-rays are absorbed on
an ambient soft photon field to produce relativistic pairs, which in turn
up-scatter the same soft photons to produce more gamma-rays. If the Compton
scatterings take place in the deep Klein-Nishina regime, then triplet pair
production ($e\gamma_b \rightarrow ee^{+}e^{-}$) becomes relevant and may even
regulate the development of the cascade. We investigate the properties of
pair-Compton cascades with triplet pair production in accelerating gaps, i.e.,
regions with an unscreened electric field. Using the method of transport
equations for the particle evolution, we compute the growth rate of the pair
cascade as a function of the accelerating electric field in the presence of
black-body and power-law ambient photon fields. Informed by the numerical
results, we derive simple analytical expressions for the peak growth rate and
the corresponding electric field. We show that for certain parameters, which
can be realized in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black holes at the
centers of active galactic nuclei, the pair cascade may well be regulated by
inverse Compton scattering in the deep Klein-Nishina regime and triplet pair
production. We present indicative examples of the escaping gamma-ray radiation
from the gap, and discuss our results in application to the TeV observations of
radio galaxy M87.

Title:Is gravity getting weaker at low z? Observational evidence and theoretical implications,"
Abstract:  Dynamical observational probes of the growth of density perturbations
indicate that gravity may be getting weaker at low redshifts $z$. This evidence
is at about $2-3\sigma$ level and comes mainly from weak lensing data that
measure the parameter $S_8=\sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{0m}/0.3}$ and redshift space
distortion data that measure the growth rate times the amplitude of the linear
power spectrum parameter $f\sigma_8 (z)$. The measured $f\sigma_8$ appears to
be lower than the prediction of General Relativity (GR) in the context of the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model as defined by the Planck best fit parameter values.
This is the well known $f\sigma_8$ tension of $\Lambda$CDM, which constitutes
one of the two main large scale challenges of the model along with the $H_0$
tension. We review the observational evidence that leads to the $f\sigma_8$
tension and discuss some theoretical implications. If this tension is not a
systematic effect it may be an early hint of modified gravity with an evolving
effective Newton's constant $G_{eff}$ and gravitational slip parameter $\eta$.
We discuss such best fit parametrizations of $G_{eff}(z)$ and point out that
they can not be reproduced by simple scalar-tensor and $f(R)$ modified gravity
theories because these theories generically predict stronger gravity than
General Relativity (GR) at low $z$ in the context of a $\Lambda$CDM background
$H(z)$. Finally, we show weak evidence for an evolving reduced absolute
magnitude of the SnIa of the Pantheon dataset at low redshifts ($z<0.1$) which
may also be explained by a reduced strength of gravity and may help resolve the
$H_0$ tension.

Title:Correlated timing noise and high precision pulsar timing: Measuring frequency second derivatives as an example,"
Abstract:  We investigate the impact of noise processes on high-precision pulsar timing.
Our analysis focuses on the measurability of the second spin frequency
derivative $\ddot{\nu}$. This $\ddot{\nu}$ can be induced by several factors
including the radial velocity of a pulsar. We use Bayesian methods to model the
pulsar times-of-arrival in the presence of red timing noise and dispersion
measure variations, modelling the noise processes as power laws. Using
simulated times-of-arrival that both include red noise, dispersion measure
variations and non-zero $\ddot{\nu}$ values, we find that we are able to
recover the injected $\ddot{\nu}$, even when the noise model used to inject and
recover the input parameters are different. Using simulations, we show that the
measurement uncertainty on $\ddot{\nu}$ decreases with the timing baseline $T$
as $T^\gamma$, where $\gamma=-7/2+\alpha/2$ for power law noise models with
shallow power law indices $\alpha$ ($0<\alpha<4$). For steep power law indices
($\alpha>8$), the measurement uncertainty reduces with $T^{-1/2}$. We applied
this method to times-of-arrival from the European Pulsar Timing Array and the
Parkes Pulsar Timing Array and determined $\ddot{\nu}$ probability density
functions for 49 millisecond pulsars. We find a statistically significant
$\ddot{\nu}$ value for PSR\,B1937+21 and consider possible options for its
origin. Significant (95 per cent C.L.) values for $\ddot{\nu}$ are also
measured for PSRs\,J0621+1002 and J1022+1001, thus future studies should
consider including it in their ephemerides. For binary pulsars with small
orbital eccentricities, like PSR\,J1909$-$3744, extended ELL1 models should be
used to overcome computational issues. The impacts of our results on the
detection of gravitational waves are also discussed.

Abstract:  In this work, we use the simulated gravitational wave (GW) standard siren
data from the future observation of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to constrain
various dark energy cosmological models, including the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM,
CPL, $\alpha$DE, GCG, and NGCG models. We also use the current mainstream
cosmological electromagnetic observations, i.e., the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies data, the baryon acoustic oscillations data, and the
type Ia supernovae data, to constrain these models. We find that the GW
standard siren data could tremendously improve the constraints on the
cosmological parameters for all these dark energy models. For all the cases,
the GW standard siren data can be used to break the parameter degeneracies
generated by the current cosmological electromagnetic observational data.
Therefore, it is expected that the future GW standard siren observation from
the ET would play a crucial role in the cosmological parameter estimation in
the future. The conclusion of this work is quite solid because it is based on
the analysis for various dark energy models.

Title:NGC 326: X-shaped no more,"
Abstract:  We present new 144-MHz LOFAR observations of the prototypical `X-shaped'
radio galaxy NGC 326, which show that the formerly known wings of the radio
lobes extend smoothly into a large-scale, complex radio structure. We argue
that this structure is most likely the result of hydrodynamical effects in an
ongoing group or cluster merger, for which pre-existing X-ray and optical data
provide independent evidence. The large-scale radio structure is hard to
explain purely in terms of jet reorientation due to the merger of binary black
holes, a previously proposed explanation for the inner structure of NGC 326.
For this reason, we suggest that the simplest model is one in which the
merger-related hydrodynamical processes account for all the source structure,
though we do not rule out the possibility that a black hole merger has
occurred. Inference of the black hole-black hole merger rate from observations
of X-shaped sources should be carried out with caution in the absence of deep,
sensitive low-frequency observations. Some X-shaped sources may be signposts of
cluster merger activity, and it would be useful to investigate the environments
of these objects more generally.

Abstract:  The Galactic Center has been under intense scrutiny in the recent years
thanks to the unprecedented missions aiming at measuring the gas and star
dynamics near the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and at finding gravitational
wave (GW) signatures of inspiralling stellar black holes. In the crowded
environment of galactic nuclei, the two-body interactions alter the
distribution of stars on long timescales, making them drift in energy and
angular momentum. We present a simplified analytical treatment of the
scattering processes in galactic stellar nuclei, assuming all stars have the
same mass. We have discussed how the interplay between two-body relaxation and
gravitational wave emission modifies the slope of the inner stellar cusp within
the SMBH sphere of influence, and calculated the rates of tidal disruption
events (TDEs) and main-sequence extreme-mass ratio inspirals (MS-EMRIs) of
stars that are tidally disrupted by the SMBH. We find that typically the ratio
of the TDE and MS-EMRI rates is the square of the ratio of the tidal and
Schwarzschild radii. For our Galaxy, this implies that the rate of MS-EMRIs is
just about a percent of the TDE rate. We then consider the role of stars
injected on highly eccentric orbits in the vicinity of the SMBH due to Hills
binary disruption mechanism, and show that the MS-EMRI rate can almost approach
the TDE rate if the binary fraction at the SMBH influence radius is close to
unity. Finally, we discuss that physical stellar collisions affect a large area
of phase space.

Title:A Comparison of the X-ray Properties of FU Ori-type Stars to Generic Young Stellar Objects,"
Abstract:  Like other young stellar objects (YSOs), FU Ori-type stars have been detected
as strong X-ray emitters. However, little is known about how the outbursts of
these stars affect their X-ray properties. We assemble available X-ray data
from XMM Newton and Chandra observations of 16 FU Ori stars, including a new
XMM Newton observation of Gaia 17bpi during its optical rise phase. Of these
stars, six were detected at least once, while 10 were non-detections, for which
we calculate upper limits on intrinsic X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) as a function
of plasma temperature ($kT$) and column density ($N_H$). The detected FU Ori
stars tend to be more X-ray luminous than typical for non-outbursting YSOs,
based on comparison to a sample of low-mass stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster.
FU Ori stars with high $L_X$ have been observed both at the onset of their
outbursts and decades later. We use the Kaplan-Meier estimator to investigate
whether the higher X-ray luminosities for FU Ori stars is characteristic or a
result of selection effects, and we find the difference to be statistically
significant ($p<0.01$) even when non-detections are taken into account. The
additional X-ray luminosity of FU Ori stars relative to non-outbursting YSOs
cannot be explained by accretion shocks, given the high observed plasma
temperatures. This suggests that, for many FU Ori stars, either 1) the outburst
leads to a restructuring of the magnetosphere in a way that enhances X-ray
emission, or 2) FU Ori outbursts are more likely to occur among YSOs with the
highest quiescent X-ray luminosity.

EUHFORIA. From the adopted WSA model we employ only the Potential Field Source
Surface (PFSS) model for the inner corona and the Schatten Current Sheet (SCS)
model for the outer (PFSS+SCS). The height, $R_{\rm ss}$, of the outer boundary
of the PFSS, known as the source surface, and the height, $R_{\rm i}$, of the
inner boundary of the SCS are important parameters affecting the modelled CH
areas. We investigate the impact the two model parameters can have in the
modelled results. We vary $R_{\rm ss}$ within the interval [1.4, 3.2]$R_{\rm
\odot}$ with a step of 0.1$R_{\rm \odot}$, and $R_{\rm i}$ within the interval

Title:Simulations Find Our Accounting of Dust-Obscured Star Formation May Be Incomplete,"
Abstract:  The bulk of the star-formation rate density peak at cosmic noon was obscured
by dust. How accurately we can assess the role of dust obscured star-formation
is affected by inherent biases in our empirical methods -- both those that rely
on direct dust emission and those that rely on the inferred dust attenuation of
starlight. We use a library of hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer
to explore these biases. We find that for IR luminous galaxies that are in
rapidly quenching systems (e.g. post-coalescence) standard luminosity-to-SFR
relations can strongly overestimate the true SFRs. We propose using the
$L_{IR}/L_{1.6}$ color to both help identify such systems and provide more
accurate SFRs. Conversely, we find that the diagnostic UVJ plot misidentifies a
subset of dusty star-forming galaxies. This is due to variability in the
effective attenuation curves including being much grayer in the
optical-to-near-IR regime than the Calzetti starburst law. This is in agreement
with recent observations of IR-selected galaxies at cosmic noon. Our results
support the view that we need a panchromatic approach from the rest-frame UV
through the IR and SED modeling that includes realistic SFHs and allows for
variable attenuation curves if we want to fully account for dust obscured
star-formation across the epochs of greatest galaxy build-up.

Title:A search for multi-planet systems with TESS using a Bayesian N-body retrieval and machine learning,"
Abstract:  Transiting exoplanets in multi-planet systems exhibit non-Keplerian orbits as
a result of the gravitational influence from companions which can cause the
times and durations of transits to vary. The amplitude and periodicity of the
transit time variations (TTV) are characteristic of the perturbing planet's
mass and orbit. The objects of interest (TOI) from the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS) are analyzed in a uniform way to search for TTVs with
sectors 1-3 of data. Due to the volume of targets in the TESS candidate list,
artificial intelligence is used to expedite the search for planets by vetting
non-transit signals prior to characterizing the light curve time series. The
residuals of fitting a linear orbit ephemeris are used to search for transit
timing variations. The significance of a perturbing planet is assessed by
comparing the Bayesian evidence between a linear and non-linear ephemeris,
which is based on an N-body simulation. Nested sampling is used to derive
posterior distributions for the N-body ephemeris and in order to expedite
convergence custom priors are designed using machine learning. A dual input,
multi-output convolutional neural network is designed to predict the parameters
of a perturbing body given the known parameters and measured perturbation
(O-C). There is evidence for 3 new multi-planet candidates (WASP-18, WASP-126,
TOI-193) with non-transiting companions using the 2 minute cadence observations
from TESS. This approach can be used to identify multi-planet systems and stars
in need of longer radial velocity and photometric follow-up than those already
performed.

Title:Fragmentation of Filamentary Cloud Permeated by Perpendicular Magnetic Field II. Dependence on the Initial Density Profile,"
Abstract:  We examine the linear stability of a filamentary cloud permeated by a
perpendicular magnetic field. The initial magnetic field is assumed to be
uniform and perpendicular to the cloud axis. The model cloud is assumed to have
a Plummer-like density profile and to be supported against the self-gravity by
turbulence. The effects of turbulence are taken into account by enhancing the
effective pressure of a low density gas. We derive the effective pressure as a
function of the density from the condition of the hydrostatic balance. It is
shown that the model cloud is more unstable against radial collapse, when the
radial density slope is shallower. When the magnetic field is mildly strong,
the radial collapse is suppressed. If the displacement vanishes in the region
very far from the cloud axis, the model cloud is stabilized completely by a
mildly strong magnetic field. If rearrangement of the magnetic flux tubes is
permitted, the model cloud is unstable even when the magnetic field is
extremely strong. The stability depends on the outer boundary condition as in
case of the isothermal cloud. The growth rate of the rearrangement mode is
smaller when the radial density slope is shallower.

Title:Star formation in low-redshift cluster dwarf galaxies,"
Abstract:  Evolution of galaxies in dense environments can be affected by close
encounters with neighbouring galaxies and interactions with the intracluster
medium. Dwarf galaxies (dGs) are important as their low mass makes them more
susceptible to these effects than giant systems. Combined luminosity functions
(LFs) in the r- and u-band of 15 galaxy clusters were constructed using
archival data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. LFs were measured as a
function of cluster-centric radius from stacked cluster data. Marginal evidence
was found for an increase in the faint-end slope of the u-band LF relative to
the r-band with increasing cluster-centric radius. The dwarf-to-giant ratio
(DGR) was found to increase toward the cluster outskirts, with the u-band DGR
increasing faster with cluster-centric radius compared to the r-band. The dG
blue fraction was found to be ~2 times larger than the giant galaxy blue
fraction over all cluster-centric distance (~5sigma level). The central
concentration (C) was used as a proxy to distinguish nucleated versus
non-nucleated dGs. The ratio of high-C to low-C dGs was found to be ~2 times
greater in the inner cluster region compared to the outskirts (2.8sigma level).
The faint-end slope of the r-band LF for the cluster outskirts (0.6 < r/r_200 <
1.0) is steeper than the SDSS field LF, while the u-band LF is marginally
steeper at the 2.5sigma level. Decrease in the faint-end slope of the r- and
u-band cluster LFs towards the cluster centre is consistent with quenching of
star formation via ram pressure stripping and galaxy-galaxy interactions.

Title:A measurement method for responsivity of microwave kinetic inductance detector by changing power of readout microwaves,"
Abstract:  Superconducting detectors are a modern technology applied in various fields.
The microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) is one of cutting-edge
superconducting detector. It is based on the principle of a superconducting
resonator circuit. A radiation entering the MKID breaks the Cooper pairs in the
superconducting resonator, and the intensity of the radiation is detected as a
variation of the resonant condition. Therefore, calibration of the detector
responsivity, i.e., the variation of the resonant phase with respect to the
number of Cooper-pair breaks (quasiparticles), is important. We propose a
method for responsivity calibration. Microwaves used for the detector readout
locally raise the temperature in each resonator, which increases the number of
quasiparticles. Since the magnitude of the temperature rise depends on the
power of readout microwaves, the number of quasiparticles also depends on the
power of microwaves. By changing the power of the readout microwaves, we
simultaneously measure the phase difference and lifetime of quasiparticles. We
calculate the number of quasiparticles from the measured lifetime and by using
a theoretical formula. This measurement yields a relation between the phase
response as a function of the number of quasiparticles. We demonstrate this
responsivity calibration using the MKID maintained at 285mK. We also confirm
consistency between the results obtained using this method and conventional
calibration methods in terms of the accuracy.

Title:Signature of stochastic acceleration and cooling processes in an outburst phase of the TeV blazar ON 231,"
Abstract:  We present a detailed spectral and temporal study of the intermediate-type
blazar ON 231 during the TeV outburst phase in 2008 June with observations
performed by Swift and XMM-Newton. The X-ray flux of the source, which was
significantly dominated by the soft photons (below $3-4$ keV), varies between
27$\%$ and 38$\%$ on day timescales, while mild variations were observed in the
optical/UV emissions. We found a maximum soft lag of $\sim 1$ hr between the UV
and soft X-ray bands, which can be understood if the magnetic field of the
emitting region is $\sim 5.6~ \delta^{-1/3}$ G. The $0.6-10$ keV spectra can be
well represented by a broken power-law model, which indicates the presence of
both synchrotron and inverse Compton components in the studied X-ray regime.
The synchrotron part of the SEDs constructed with simultaneous optical/UV and
X-ray data follows a log-parabolic shape. A time-resolved spectral analysis
shows that the break energy varies significantly between 2.4 and 7.3 keV with
the changing flux state of the source, and the similar variations of the
spectral slopes of the two components support the SSC scenario. The synchrotron
tail, following a log-parabolic function, shows that the peak frequency
($\nu_{p}$) varies by two orders of magnitude ($\sim 10^{14}-10^{16}$ Hz)
during the event. A significantly positive $E_{p}-\beta$ relation is observed
from both SED and time-resolved spectral analyses. The most feasible scenario
for the observed trend during the flaring event could be associated with a
magnetic-field-driven stochastic process evolving toward an equilibrium energy
level.

Title:Viscosity in cosmic fluids,"
Abstract:  The effective theory of large-scale structure formation based on $\Lambda$CDM
paradigm predicts finite dissipative effects in the resulting fluid equations.
In this work, we study how viscous effect that could arise if one includes
self-interaction among the dark-matter particles combines with the effective
theory. It is shown that these two possible sources of dissipation can operate
together in a cosmic fluid and the interplay between them can play an important
role in determining dynamics of the cosmic fluid. In particular, we demonstrate
that the viscosity coefficient due to self-interaction is added inversely with
the viscosity calculated using effective theory of $\Lambda$CDM model. Thus the
larger viscosity has less significant contribution in the effective viscosity.
Using the known bounds on $\,\sigma/m$ for self-interacting dark-matter, where
$\,\sigma\,$ and $m$ are the cross-section and mass of the dark-matter
particles respectively, we discuss role of the effective viscosity in various
cosmological scenarios.

Title:Variation of mass accretion rate onto the white dwarf in the dwarf nova VW Hyi in quiescence,"
Abstract:  We have analysed a series of Suzaku data and one dataset of XMM-Newton of the
SU UMa type dwarf nova VW Hyi in optical quiescence. The observed spectra in
the 0.2-10 keV band are moderately well represented by multi-temperature
thermal plasma emission models with a maximum temperature of 5-9 keV and
bolometric luminosity of 2.4-5.2 $\times$ 10$^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The mass
accretion rate derived from the hard X-ray spectra does not show any clear
trend as a function of time since the last superoutburst, in contradiction to
theoretical predictions of the disc behaviour of a SU UMa type dwarf nova. The
mass accretion rate, on the other hand, shows a clear declining trend with time
since the last outburst (including the superoutburst). The rate of decline is
of the same order as that evaluated from the hard X-ray light curves of the
other two dwarf novae SS Cyg and SU UMa. The standard disc instability model,
on the other hand, predicts that the mass accretion rate should increase
throughout the optically-quiescent phase. We need further observation and
theoretical consideration to resolve this discrepancy.

Abstract:  We perform a search for gravitational waves (GWs) from several supermassive
binary black hole (SMBBH) candidates (NGC 5548, Mrk 231, OJ 287, PG 1302-102,
NGC 4151, Ark 120 and 3C 66B) in long-term timing observations of the pulsar
PSR J1909$-$3744 obtained using the Parkes radio telescope. No statistically
significant signals were found. We constrain the chirp masses of those SMBBH
candidates and find the chirp mass of NGC 5548 and 3C 66B to be less than $2.4
\times 10^9\,\rm M_{\odot}$ and $2.5 \times 10^9\,\rm M_{\odot}$ (with 95%
confidence), respectively. Our upper limits remain a factor of 3 to 370 above
the likely chirp masses for these candidates as estimated from other
approaches. The observations processed here provide upper limits on the GW
strain amplitude that improve upon the results from the first Parkes Pulsar
Timing Array data release by a factor of 2 to 7. We investigate how information
about the orbital parameters can help improve the search sensitivity for
individual SMBBH systems. Finally, we show that these limits are insensitive to
uncertainties in the Solar System ephemeris model.

Title:First Generation Heterodyne Instrumentation Concepts for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope,"
Abstract:  (abridged) The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)
project aims to build a 50-m-class submm telescope with $>1^\circ$ field of
view, high in the Atacama Desert, providing fast and detailed mapping of the
mm/submm sky. It will thus serve as a strong complement to existing facilities
such as ALMA. ALMA's small field of view ($<15^{\prime\prime}$ at 350 GHz)
limits its mapping speed for large surveys. Instead, a single dish with a large
field of view such as the AtLAST concept can host large multi-element
instruments that can more efficiently map large portions of the sky. Small
aperture survey instruments (typically much smaller than $<3\times$ the size of
an interferometric array element) can mitigate this somewhat but lack the
resolution for accurate recovery of source location and have small collecting
areas. Furthermore, small aperture survey instruments do not provide sufficient
overlap in the spatial scales they sample to provide a complete reconstruction
of extended sources (i.e.\ the zero-spacing information is incomplete in
$u,v$-space.) The heterodyne instrumentation for the AtLAST telescope that we
consider here will take advantage of extensive developments in the past decade
improving the performance and pixel count of heterodyne focal plane arrays.
Such instrumentation, with higher pixel counts, has alredy begun to take
advantage of integration in the focal planes to increase packaging efficiency
over simply stacking modular mixer blocks in the focal plane. We extrapolate
from the current state-of-the-art to present concept first-generation
heterodyne designs for AtLAST.

Title:Astro2020 Science White Paper: Exploration and characterization of the earliest epoch of galaxy formation: beyond the re-ionization era,"
Abstract:  State-of-the-art rest-frame UV and FIR photometric and spectroscopic
observations are now pushing the redshift frontiers of galaxy formation studies
up to $z\sim9-11$ and beyond. Recent HST observations unveiled the presence of
a star-forming galaxy exhibiting the Lyman break at $\lambda_{\rm
obs}=1.47\pm0.01$ $\mu$m, i.e., a $z=11.09^{+0.08}_{-0.12}$ galaxy with a
stellar mass of $\sim10^9 M_\odot$, demonstrating that galaxy build-up was well
underway early in the epoch of reionization (EoR) at $z>10$. Targeted
spectroscopy of a lensed Lyman break galaxy uncovers the earliest metals known
to date up to $z=9.1096\pm0.0006$ by detecting the bright [OIII] 88~$\mu$m
nebular line, indicating the onset of star formation 250 million years after
the Big Bang, i.e., corresponding to a redshift of $z\sim15$. These latest
findings lead us to a number of key questions: How and when metal enrichment
happened in the EoR? What was the nature of the earliest-epoch star-forming
galaxies at $z=10-15$? What was the spatial distribution of such galaxies, and
what was the relation to the putative large-scale ionization bubbles during the
EoR? What were the dark-halo masses of such earliest-epoch star-forming
galaxies? To address all these questions, we need to uncover a statistically
large number of $z=10-15$ galaxies in the pre-reionization era. Here we argue
two possible pathways: (1) a wide-area, sensitive blind spectroscopic survey of
[OIII] 88 $\mu$m line-emitting galaxies at submillimeter wavelengths, and (2)
an ultra-wide-area, high-cadence photometric survey of transient sources at
radio-to-(sub)millimeter wavelengths, together with the immediate follow-up
spectroscopy with an ultra-wide-band spectrograph, to catch the pop-III
$\gamma$-ray bursts.

Title:Momentum and energy injection by a supernova remnant into an inhomogeneous medium,"
Abstract:  We investigate the effect of mass-loading from embedded clouds on the
evolution of supernova remnants and on the energy and momentum that they inject
into an inhomogeneous interstellar medium. We use 1D hydrodynamical
calculations and assume that the clouds are numerous enough that they can be
treated in the continuous limit. The destruction of embedded clouds adds mass
into the remnant, increasing its density and pressure, and decreasing its
temperature. The remnant cools more quickly, is less able to do PdV work on the
swept-up gas, and ultimately attains a lower final momentum (by up to a factor
of two or more). We thus find that the injection of momentum is more sensitive
to an inhomogeneous environment than previous work has suggested, and we
provide fits to our results for the situation where the cloud mass is not
limited. The behaviour of the remnant is more complex in situations where the
cloud mass is finite and locally runs out. In the case of multiple supernovae
in a clustered environment, later supernova explosions may encounter higher
densities than previous explosions due to the prior liberation of mass from
engulfed clouds. If the cloud mass is finite, later explosions may be able to
create a sustained hot phase when earlier explosions have not been able to.

Title:Dynamics of cluster-forming hub-filament systems: The case of the high-mass star-forming complex Monoceros R2,"
Abstract:  High-mass stars and star clusters commonly form within hub-filament systems.
Monoceros R2, harbors one of the closest such systems, making it an excellent
target for case studies. We investigate the morphology, stability and dynamical
properties of the hub-filament system on basis of 13CO and C18O observations
obtained with the IRAM-30m telescope and H2 column density maps derived from
Herschel dust emission observations. We identified the filamentary network and
characterized the individual filaments as either main (converging into the hub)
or secondary (converging to a main filament) filaments. The main filaments have
line masses of 30-100 Msun/pc and show signs of fragmentation. The secondary
filaments have line masses of 12-60 Msun/pc and show fragmentation only
sporadically. In the context of Ostriker's hydrostatic filament model, the main
filaments are thermally super-critical. If non-thermal motions are included,
most of them are trans-critical. Most of the secondary filaments are roughly
trans-critical regardless of whether non-thermal motions are included or not.
From the main filaments, we estimate a mass accretion rate of 10(-4)-10(-3)
Msun/pc into the hub. The secondary filaments accrete into the main filaments
with a rate of 0.1-0.4x10(-4) Msun/pc. The main filaments extend into the hub.
Their velocity gradients increase towards the hub, suggesting acceleration of
the gas. We estimate that with the observed infall velocity, the mass-doubling
time of the hub is ~2.5 Myr, ten times larger than the free-fall time,
suggesting a dynamically old region. These timescales are comparable with the
chemical age of the HII region. Inside the hub, the main filaments show a ring-
or a spiral-like morphology that exhibits rotation and infall motions. One
possible explanation for the morphology is that gas is falling into the central
cluster following a spiral-like pattern.

Title:Stochastic modeling of the time variability of ALMA calibrators,"
Abstract:  Characterizing the variability of the extragalactic sources used for
calibration in the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) is key
to assess the flux scale uncertainty of science observations. To this end, we
model the variability of 39 quasars which have been used by ALMA as secondary
flux calibrators using continuous time stochastic processes. This formalism is
specially adapted to the multi-frequency, quasi-periodic sampling which
characterizes the calibration monitoring of ALMA. We find that simple mixtures
of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes can describe well the flux and spectral index
variability of these sources for Bands 3 and 7 (91.5 and 103.5, and 343.5 GHz,
respectively). The spectral shape of the calibrators are characterized by
negative spectral indices, mostly between $-0.35$ and $-0.80$, and with
additional concavity. The model provides forecasts, interpolations, and
uncertainty estimations for the observed fluxes that depend on the intrinsic
variability of the source. These can be of practical use for the ALMA data
calibrator survey and data quality assurance.

Abstract:  We searched for isolated dark matter deprived galaxies within several

and Horizon-AGN and found a handful of promising objects in all except
Horizon-AGN. While our initial goal was to study their properties and
evolution, we quickly noticed that all of them were located at the edge of
their respective simulation boxes. After carefully investigating these objects
using the full particle data, we concluded that they are not merely caused by a
problem with the algorithm identifying bound structures. We provide strong
evidence that these oddballs were created from regular galaxies that get torn
apart due to unphysical processes when crossing the edge of the simulation box.
We show that these objects are smoking guns indicating an issue with the
implementation of the periodic boundary conditions of the particle data in
Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE, which was eventually traced down to be a
minor bug occurring for a very rare set of conditions.

host galaxies. We use the integral field spectrograph (IFS) of Mapping Nearby
Galaxies (MaNGA) at Apache Point Observatory (APO) to get the 2D maps of the
parameter properties for eleven SN host galaxies. The sample galaxies are
analyzed one by one in details on their properties of velocity field, star
formation rate, oxygen abundance and stellar mass etc. This sample of SN host
galaxies have redshifts around $z$ $\sim$ 0.03, which is higher than those of
the previous related works. The higher redshift distribution allows us to
obtain the properties of more distant SN host galaxies. Metallicity (gas-phase
oxygen abundance) estimated from integrated spectra could represent the local
metallicity at SN explosion sites with small bias. All the host galaxies in our
sample are metal-rich galaxies (12+log(O/H) $>$ 8.5) except for NGC 6387, which
means supernovae (SNe) may be more inclined to explode in rich-metallicity
galaxies. There is a positive relation between global gas-phase oxygen
abundance and the stellar mass of host galaxies. We also try to compare the
differences of the host galaxies between SN Ia and SN II. In our sample, both
SNe Ia and SNe II could explode in normal galaxies, while SNe II also could
explode in an interactive or merger system, which has star formation in the

that the radii agree within the limits of measurement errors, which proves

Abstract:  By incorporating quantum aspects of gravity, Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC)
provides a self-consistent extension of the inflationary scenario, allowing for
modifications in the primordial inflationary power spectrum with respect to the
standard General Relativity one. We investigate such modifications and explore
the constraints imposed by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Planck
Collaboration data on the Warm Inflation (WI) scenario in the LQC context. We
obtain useful relations between the dissipative parameter of WI and the bounce
scale parameter of LQC. We also find that the number of required e-folds of
expansion from the bounce instant till the moment the observable scales crossed
the Hubble radius during inflation can be smaller in WI than in CI. In
particular, we find that this depends on how large is the dissipation in WI,
with the amount of required e-folds decreasing with the increasing of the
dissipation value. Furthermore, by performing a Monte Carlo Markov Chain
analysis for the considered WI models, we find good agreement of the model with
the data. This shows that the WI models studied here can explain the current
observations also in the context of LQC.

Title:The Abundance and Structure of Subhaloes near the Free Streaming Scale and Their Impact on Indirect Dark Matter Searches,"
Abstract:  The free streaming motion of dark matter particles imprints a cutoff in the
matter power spectrum and set the scale of the smallest dark matter halo.
Recent cosmological $N$-body simulations have shown that the central density
cusp is much steeper in haloes near the free streaming scale than in more
massive haloes. Here, we study the abundance and structure of subhaloes near
the free streaming scale at very high redshift using a suite of unprecedentedly
large cosmological $N$-body simulations, over a wide range of the host halo
mass. The subhalo abundance is suppressed strongly below the free streaming
scale, but the ratio between the subhalo mass function in the cutoff and no
cutoff simulations is well fitted by a single correction function regardless of
the host halo mass and the redshift. In subhaloes, the central slopes are
considerably shallower than in field haloes, however, are still steeper than
that of the NFW profile. Contrary, the concentrations are significantly larger
in subhaloes than haloes and depend on the subhalo mass. We compare two methods
to extrapolate the mass-concentration relation of haloes and subhaloes to z=0
and provide a new simple fitting function for subhaloes, based on a suite of
large cosmological $N$-body simulations. Finally, we estimate the annihilation
boost factor of a Milky-Way sized halo to be between 1.8 and 6.2.

Abstract:  We investigate the possibility of dark matter being a pure geometrical
effect, rather than a particle or a compact object, by exploring a specific
modified gravity model: mimetic dark matter. We present an alternative
formulation of the theory, closer to the standard cosmological perturbation
theory framework. We make manifest the presence of arbitrary parameters and
extra functions, both at background level and at first order in perturbation
theory. We present the full set of independent equations of motion for this
model, and we discuss the amount of tuning needed to match predictions of the
theory to actual data. By using the matter power spectrum and cosmic microwave
background angular power spectra as benchmark observables, we explicitly show
that since there is no natural mechanism to generate adiabatic initial
conditions in this specific model, extra fine-tuning is required. We modify the
publicly available Boltzmann code \texttt{CLASS} to make accurate predictions
for the observables in mimetic dark matter. Our modified version of
\texttt{CLASS} is available on GitHub. We have used mimetic dark matter as an
illustration of how much one is allowed to change the initial conditions before
contradicting observations when modifying the laws of gravity as described by
General Relativity but we point out that modifying gravity without providing a
natural mechanism to generate adiabatic initial conditions will always lead to
highly fine-tuned models.

Title:Very high-energy constraints on the Infrared Extragalactic Background Light,"
Abstract:  Context. Measurements of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) are a
fundamental source of information on the collective emission of cosmic sources.
Aims. At infrared wavelengths, however, these measurements are precluded by
the overwhelming dominance from Interplanetary Dust emission and the Galactic
infrared foreground. Only at $\lambda > 300 \ \mu$m, where the foregrounds are
minimal, has the Infrared EBL (IR EBL) been inferred from analysis of the COBE
maps. The present paper aims to assess the possibility of evaluating the IR EBL
from a few $\mu$m up to the peak of the emission at >100 $\mu$m using an
indirect method that avoids the foreground problem.
Methods. To this purpose we exploit the effect of pair-production from
gamma-gamma interaction by considering the highest energy photons emitted by
extragalactic sources and their interaction with the IR EBL photons. We
simulate observations of a variety of low redshift emitters with the
forthcoming Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) arrays (CTA in
particular) and water Cherenkov observatories (LHAASO, HAWC, SWGO) to assess
their suitability to constrain the EBL at such long wavelengths.
Results. We find that, even under the most extremely favorable conditions of
huge emission flares, extremely high-energy emitting blazars are not very
useful for our purpose because they are much too distant (>100 Mpc the nearest
ones, MKN 501 and MKN 421). Observations of more local Very High Energy (VHE)
emitting AGNs, like low-redshift radio galaxies (M87, IC 310, Centaurus A), are
better suited and will potentially allow us to constrain the EBL up to $\lambda
\simeq 100\ \mu$m.

"Title:Metallicity, temperature, and gravity scales of M subdwarfs","
Abstract:  The aim of the project is to define a metallicity/gravity/temperature scale
vs spectral types for metal-poor M dwarfs.
We obtained intermediate-resolution ultraviolet (R~3300), optical (R~5400),
and near-infrared (R~3900) spectra of 43 M subdwarfs (sdM), extreme subdwarfs
(esdM), and ultra-subdwarfs (usdM) with the X-shooter spectrograph on the
European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope. We compared our atlas of
spectra to the latest BT-Settl synthetic spectral energy distribution over a
wide range of metallicities, gravities, and effective temperatures to infer the
physical properties for the whole M dwarf sequence (M0--M9.5) at sub-solar
metallicities and constrain the latest state-of-the-art atmospheric models.
The BT-Settl models reproduce well the observed spectra across the 450-2500
nm wavelength range except for a few regions. We find that the best fits are
obtained for gravities of log(g) = 5.0-5.5 dex for the three metal classes. We
infer metallicities of [Fe/H] = -0.5, -1.5, and -2.0+/-0.5 dex and effective
temperatures of 3700-2600 K, 3800-2900 K, and 3700-2900 K for subdwarfs,
extreme subdwarfs, and ultra-subdwarfs, respectively. Metal-poor M dwarfs tend
to be warmer by about 200+/-100 K and exhibit higher gravity than their
solar-metallicity counterparts. We derive abundances of several elements (Fe,
Na, K, Ca, Ti) for our sample but cannot describe their atmospheres with a
single metallicity parameter. Our metallicity scale expands the current scales
available for midly metal-poor planet-host low-mass stars. Our compendium of
moderate-resolution spectra covering the 0.45--2.5 micron range represents an
important legacy value for large-scale surveys and space missions to come.

Title:The Clustering of Undetected High-redshift Black Holes and Their Signatures in Cosmic Backgrounds,"
Abstract:  There exist hitherto unexplained fluctuations in the Cosmic Infrared
Background (CIB) on arcminute scales and larger. These have been shown to
cross-correlate with the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB), leading several authors
to attribute the excess to a high-redshift growing black hole population. In
order to investigate potential sources that could explain this excess, in this
paper, we develop a new framework to compute the power spectrum of undetected
sources that do not have constant flux as a function of halo mass. In this
formulation, we combine a semi-analytic model for black hole growth and their
simulated spectra from hydrodynamical simulations. Revisiting the possible
contribution of a high-redshift black hole population, we find that too much
black hole growth is required at early epochs for z>6 accretion to explain
these fluctuations. Examining a population of accreting black holes at more
moderate redshifts, z\sim 2-3, we find that such models produce a poor fit to
the observed fluctuations while simultaneously overproducing the local black
hole mass density. Additionally, we rule out the hypothesis of a missing
Galactic foreground of warm dust that produces coherent fluctuations in the
X-ray via reflection of Galactic X-ray binary emission. Although we firmly rule
out accreting massive black holes as the source of these missing fluctuations,
additional studies will be required to determine their origin.

Title:Performance and science reach of POEMMA for ultrahigh-energy particles,"
Abstract:  The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) is a potential
NASA Astrophysics Probe-class mission designed to observe ultra-high energy
cosmic rays (UHECRs) and cosmic neutrinos from space. POEMMA will monitor
colossal volumes of the Earth's atmosphere to detect extensive air showers
(EASs) produced by extremely energetic cosmic messengers: UHECRs above 20 EeV
over the full sky and cosmic neutrinos above 20 PeV. We focus most of this
study on the impact of POEMMA for UHECR science by simulating the detector
response and mission performance for EAS from UHECRs. We show that POEMMA will
provide a significant increase in the statistics of observed UHECRs at the
highest energies over the entire sky. POEMMA will be the first UHECR
fluorescence detector deployed in space that will provide high-quality
stereoscopic observations of the longitudinal development of air showers.
Therefore, it will be able to provide event-by-event estimates of the
calorimetric energy and nuclear mass of UHECRs. The particle physics in the
interactions limits the interpretation of the shower maximum on an event by
event basis. In contrast, the calorimetric energy measurement is significantly
less sensitive to the different possible final states in the early
interactions. We study the prospects to discover the origin and nature of
UHECRs using expectations for measurements of the energy spectrum, the
distribution of arrival direction, and the atmospheric column depth at which
the EAS longitudinal development reaches maximum. We also explore supplementary
science capabilities of POEMMA through its sensitivity to particle interactions
at extreme energies and its ability to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos and
photons produced by top-down models including cosmic strings and super-heavy
dark matter particle decay in the halo of the Milky Way.

Title:Features in cosmic-ray lepton data unveil the properties of nearby cosmic accelerators,"
Abstract:  We present a comprehensive discussion about the origin of the features in the
leptonic component of the cosmic-ray spectrum. Working in the framework of a
up-to-date CR transport scenario tuned on the most recent AMS-02 and Voyager
data, we show that the prominent features recently found in the positron and in
the all-electron spectra by several experiments are explained in a scenario in
which pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are the dominant sources of the positron flux,
and nearby supernova remnants shape the high-energy peak of the electron
spectrum. In particular we argue that the drop-off in positron spectrum found
by AMS-02 at $\sim 300$ GeV can be explained --- under different assumptions
--- in terms of a prominent PWN that provides the bulk of the observed
positrons in the $\sim 100$ GeV domain, on top of the contribution from a large
number of older objects. Finally, we turn our attention to the spectral
softening at $\sim 1$ TeV in the all-lepton spectrum, recently reported by
several experiments, showing that it requires the presence of a nearby
supernova remnant at its final stage.

Title:Angular momentum transport in massive stars and natal neutron star rotation rates,"
Abstract:  The internal rotational dynamics of massive stars are poorly understood. If
angular momentum (AM) transport between the core and the envelope is
inefficient, the large core AM upon core-collapse will produce rapidly rotating
neutron stars (NSs). However, observations of low-mass stars suggest an
efficient AM transport mechanism is at work, which could drastically reduce NS
spin rates. Here we study the effects of the baroclinic instability and the
magnetic Tayler instability in differentially rotating radiative zones.
Although the baroclinic instability may occur, the Tayler instability is likely
to be more effective for AM transport. We implement Tayler torques as
prescribed by Fuller et al. 2019 into models of massive stars, finding they
remove the vast majority of the core's AM as it contracts between the main
sequence and helium-burning phases of evolution. If core AM is conserved during
core-collapse, we predict natal NS rotation periods of $P_{\rm NS} \approx
50-200 \, {\rm ms}$, suggesting these torques help explain the relatively slow
rotation rates of most young NSs, and the rarity of rapidly rotating
engine-driven supernovae. Stochastic spin-up via waves just before
core-collapse, asymmetric explosions, and various binary evolution scenarios
may increase the initial rotation rates of many NSs.

Title:Most Black Holes are Born Very Slowly Rotating,"
Abstract:  The age of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has begun, and black hole (BH)
mergers detected by LIGO are providing novel constraints on massive star
evolution. A major uncertainty in stellar theory is the angular momentum (AM)
transport within the star that determines its core rotation rate and the
resulting BH's spin. Internal rotation rates of low-mass stars measured from
asteroseismology prove that AM transport is efficient, suggesting that massive
stellar cores may rotate slower than prior expectations. We investigate AM
transport via the magnetic Tayler instability, which can largely explain the
rotation rates of low-mass stars and white dwarfs. Implementing an updated AM
transport prescription into models of high-mass stars, we compute the spins of
their BH remnants. We predict that BHs born from single stars rotate very
slowly, with $a \sim 10^{-2}$, regardless of initial rotation rate, possibly
explaining the low $\chi_{\rm eff}$ of most BH binaries detected by LIGO thus
far. A limited set of binary models suggests slow rotation for many binary
scenarios as well, although homogeneous evolution and tidal spin-up of
post-common envelope helium stars can create moderate or high BH spins. We make
predictions for the values of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ in future LIGO events, and we
discuss implications for engine-powered transients.

Title:Revisiting the Fanaroff-Riley dichotomy and radio-galaxy morphology with the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS),"
Abstract:  The relative positions of the high and low surface brightness regions of
radio-loud active galaxies in the 3CR sample were found by Fanaroff and Riley
to be correlated with their luminosity. We revisit this canonical relationship
with a sample of 5805 extended radio-loud AGN from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky
Survey (LoTSS), compiling the most complete dataset of radio-galaxy
morphological information obtained to date. We demonstrate that, for this
sample, radio luminosity does *not* reliably predict whether a source is
edge-brightened (FRII) or centre-brightened (FRI). We highlight a large
population of low-luminosity FRIIs, extending three orders of magnitude below
the traditional FR break, and demonstrate that their host galaxies are on
average systematically fainter than those of high-luminosity FRIIs and of FRIs
matched in luminosity. This result supports the jet power/environment paradigm
for the FR break: low-power jets may remain undisrupted and form hotspots in
lower mass hosts. We also find substantial populations that appear physically
distinct from the traditional FR classes, including candidate restarting
sources and ``hybrids''. We identify 459 bent-tailed sources, which we find to
have a significantly higher SDSS cluster association fraction (at $z<0.4$) than
the general radio-galaxy population, similar to the results of previous work.
The complexity of the LoTSS faint, extended radio sources demonstrates the need
for caution in the automated classification and interpretation of extended
sources in modern radio surveys, but also reveals the wealth of morphological
information such surveys will provide and its value for advancing our physical
understanding of radio-loud AGN.

Title:Signatures of the Core-Powered Mass-Loss Mechanism in the Exoplanet Population: Dependence on Stellar Properties and Observational Predictions,"
Abstract:  Recent studies have shown that atmospheric mass-loss powered by the cooling
luminosity of a planet's core can explain the observed radius valley separating
super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, even without photoevaporation. In this work, we
investigate the dependence of this core-powered mass-loss mechanism on stellar
mass ($M_\ast$), metallicity ($Z_\ast$) and age ($\tau_\ast$). Without making
any changes to the underlying planet population, we find that the core-powered
mass-loss model yields a shift in the radius valley to larger planet sizes
around more massive stars with a slope given by $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d
log}M_\ast \simeq 0.35$, in agreement with observations. To first order, this
slope is driven by the dependence of core-powered mass-loss on the bolometric
luminosity of the host star and is given by $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}M_\ast
\simeq (3\alpha-2)/36 \simeq 0.33$, where $(L_\ast/L_\odot) =
(M_\ast/M_\odot)^\alpha$ is the stellar mass-luminosity relation and
$\alpha\simeq 4.6$ for the CKS dataset. We therefore find, in contrast to
photoevaporation models, no evidence for a linear correlation between planet
and stellar mass, but can't rule it out either. In addition, we show that the
location of the radius valley is, to first order, independent of stellar age
and metallicity. Since core-powered mass-loss proceeds over Gyr timescales, the
abundance of super-Earths relative to sub-Neptunes increases with age but
decreases with stellar metallicity. Finally, due the dependence of the
envelope's cooling timescale on metallicity, we find that the radii of
sub-Neptunes increase with metallicity and decrease with age with slopes given
by $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}Z_\ast \simeq 0.1$ and $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d
log}\tau_\ast \simeq -0.1$, respectively. We conclude with a series of
observational tests that can differentiate between core-powered mass-loss and
photoevaporation models.

Title:Ram-pressure stripping of a kicked Hill sphere: Prompt electromagnetic emission from the merger of stellar mass black holes in an AGN accretion disk,"
Abstract:  Accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBH) are promising sites
for stellar mass black hole (BH) mergers due to mass segregation and merger
acceleration by disk gas torques. Here we show that a GW-kick at BH merger
causes ram-pressure stripping of gas within the BH Hill sphere. If $R_{H}\geq
H$, the disk height, an off-center UV flare at $a_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{3}r_{g}$
emerges within $t_{\rm UV} \sim \rm{O}(2 {\rm days})(a_{\rm
BH}/10^{3}r_{g})(M_{\rm SMBH}/10^{8}M_{\odot})(v_{\rm kick}/10^{2}\rm{km/s})$
post-merger and lasts O$(R_{H}/v_{\rm kick}) \sim \rm{O}(5 t_{\rm UV}$). The
flare emerges with luminosity O($10^{42}{\rm erg/s})(t_{\rm UV}/2{\rm
days})^{-1}(M_{\rm Hill}/1M_{\odot})(v_{\rm kick}/10^{2}{\rm km/s})^{2}$. AGN
optical/UV photometry alters and asymmetric broad emission line profiles can
develop after weeks. If $R_{H}<H$, detectability depends on disk optical depth.
Follow-up by large optical sky surveys is optimized for small GW error volumes
and for LIGO/Virgo triggers $>50M_{\odot}$.

Title:Discovery of a close-separation binary quasar at the heart of a z~0.2 merging galaxy and its implications for low-frequency gravitational waves,"
Abstract:  Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries with masses of ~10^8--10^9 Msun are
expected to dominate the contribution to the as-yet undetected gravitational
wave background (GWB) signal at the nanohertz frequencies accessible to Pulsar
Timing Arrays (PTA). We currently lack firm empirical constraints on the
amplitude of the GWB due to the dearth of confirmed SMBH binaries in the
required mass range. Using HST/WFC3 images, we have discovered a z~0.2 quasar
hosted in a merger remnant with two closely separated (0.13'' or ~430pc)
continuum cores at the heart of the galaxy SDSSJ1010+1413. The two cores are
spatially coincident with two powerful [OIII]-emitting point sources with
quasar-like luminosities (L_AGN ~ 5x10^46 erg/s, suggesting the presence of a
bound SMBH system, each with M_BH > 4x10^8 Msun. We place an upper limit on the
merging timescale of the SMBH pair of 2.5 billion years, roughly the Universe
lookback time at z~0.2. There is likely a population of quasar binaries similar
to SDSSJ1010+1413 that contribute to a stochastic GWB that should be detected
in the next several years. If the GWB is not detected this could indicate that
SMBHs merge only over extremely long timescales, remaining as close separation
binaries for many Hubble times, the so-called `final-parsec problem'.

the component stars. Our analysis is based on archival photometry from the Wide
Angle Search for Planets (WASP), new photometry from the 32 cm {Command Module
Observatory (CMO) telescope in Arizona and the 70 cm telescope at Thacher
Observatory in California}, and new high-resolution infrared spectra obtained
with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) on the Discovery
Channel Telescope. The masses and radii we measure for each component star
disagree with previously reported measurements. We show that both stars are
early M-type main-sequence stars without evidence for youth or hyper-inflation
($M_1= 0.661\ ^{+0.008}_{-0.036}\ \rm{M_{sun}}$, $M_2= 0.608\

the orbital period and eclipse ephemerides for the system. We suggest that the
likely cause of the initial hyper-inflated result is the use of
moderate-resolution spectroscopy for precise radial velocity measurements.

Title:External photoevaporation of circumstellar disks constrains the timescale for planet formation,"
Abstract:  Planet-forming circumstellar disks are a fundamental part of the star
formation process. Since stars form in a hierarchical fashion in groups of up
to hundreds or thousands, the UV radiation environment that these disks are
exposed to can vary in strength by at least six orders of magnitude. This
radiation can limit the masses and sizes of the disks. Diversity in star
forming environments can have long lasting effects in disk evolution and in the
resulting planetary populations. We perform simulations to explore the
evolution of circumstellar disks in young star clusters. We include viscous
evolution, as well as the impact of dynamical encounters and external
photoevaporation. We find that photoevaporation is an important process in
destroying circumstellar disks: in regions of stellar density $\rho \sim 100
\mathrm{\ M}_\odot \mathrm{\ pc}^{-3}\mathrm{\ }$ around 80% of disks are
destroyed before 2 Myr of cluster evolution. Our findings are in agreement with
observed disk fractions in young star forming regions and support previous
estimations that planet formation must start in timescales < 0.1 - 1 Myr.

Abstract:  Using the cross-matched data of Gaia DR2 and 2MASS Point Source Catalog, we
investigated the surface density distribution of stars aged ~1 Gyr in the thin
disk in the range of 90 <= l <= 270. We selected 4,654 stars above
the turnoff corresponding to the age ~1 Gyr, that fall within a small box
region in the color-magnitude diagram, (J-Ks)0 versus M(Ks), for which the
distance and reddening are corrected. The selected sample shows an arm-like
overdensity at 90 <= l <= 190.This overdensity is located close to
the Local arm traced by high-mass star forming regions (HMSFRs), but its pitch
angle is slightly larger than that of the HMSFR-defined arm. Although the
significance of the overdensity we report is marginal, its structure poses
questions concerning both of the competing scenarios of spiral arms, the
density-wave theory and the dynamic spiral arm model. The offset between the
arms traced by stars and HMSFRs, i.e., gas, is difficult to be explained by the
dynamic arm scenario. On the other hand, the pitch angle of the stellar Local
arm, if confirmed, larger than that of the Perseus arm is difficult to be
explained with the classical density-wave scenario. The dynamic arm scenario
can explain it if the Local arm is in a growing up phase, while the Perseus arm
is in a disrupting phase. Our result provides a new and complex picture of the
Galactic spiral arms, and encourages further studies.

Title:Gaia Data Release 2 Catalogue of Extremely-low Mass White Dwarf Candidates,"
Abstract:  Extremely-low mass white dwarf stars (ELMs) are M < 0.3 MSun helium-core
white dwarfs born either as a result of a common-envelope phase or after a
stable Roche-lobe overflow episode in a multiple system. The Universe is not
old enough for ELMs to have formed through single-star evolution channels. As
remnants of binary evolution, ELMs can shed light onto the poorly understood
phase of common-envelope evolution and provide constraints to the physics of
mass accretion. Most known ELMs will merge in less than a Hubble time,
providing an important contribution to the signal to be detected by upcoming
space-based gravitational wave detectors. There are currently less than 150
known ELMs; most were selected by colour, focusing on hot objects, in a
magnitude-limited survey of the Northern hemisphere only. Recent theoretical
models have predicted a much larger spacial density for ELMs than estimated
observationally based on this limited sample. In order to perform meaningful
comparisons with theoretical models and test their predictions, a larger
well-defined sample is required. In this work, we present a catalogue of ELM
candidates selected from the second data release of Gaia (DR2). We have used
predictions from theoretical models and analysed the properties of the known
sample to map the space spanned by ELMs in the Gaia Hertzsprung-Russell

Title:How Dense a CSM is Sufficient to Choke a Jet?,"
Abstract:  The progenitor stars of stripped-envelope high-velocity supernovae (Ic-BL
SNe) can explode inside a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that extends out to
many times the progenitor radius. This complicates the question of whether all
Ic-BL SNe harbor a jet, which can tunnel through the star and be viewed on-axis
as a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB). More specifically, a sufficiently
dense CSM might ""choke"" the jet, redistributing its energy quasi-spherically.
In this study, we numerically calculate the CSM density necessary for
jet-choking. For typical GRBs, we determine the jet is not choked in the CSM
unless $\rho r^2 > 4 \times 10^{19}$ g/cm; this requires several solar masses
of CSM to be situated within $10^{13}$ cm of the progenitor, a much higher
density than any CSM observed. We conclude that typical GRB jets are not choked
in the CSM. However, in many cases the CSM has sufficient mass to decelerate
the jet to a modest Lorentz factor ($\Gamma \sim 10$), which should lead to a
long coasting phase for the jet, observable as a long plateau (potentially up
to a few days) in the afterglow light curve. For extreme cases of low-energy
GRBs in a high-mass CSM, the jet will decelerate to nonrelativistic velocities,
causing it to spread modestly to a larger opening angle ($\theta_j \approx 20$
degrees) before breaking out of the CSM. Even in these extreme examples, the
jet does not have time to redistribute its energy quasi-spherically in the CSM
before breakout.

Title:NGC 7457: Evidence for merger-driven cylindrical rotation in disc galaxies,"
Abstract:  We construct Schwarzschild orbit-based models of NGC 7457, known as a
peculiar low-mass lenticular galaxy. Our best-fitting model successfully
retrieves most of the unusual kinematics behaviours of this galaxy, in which,
the orbital distribution of stars is dominated by warm and hot orbits. The
reconstructed surface brightness of the hot component matches fairly well the
photometric bulge and the reconstructed LOSVD map of this component shows clear
rotation around the major photometric axis of the galaxy. In the absence of a
dominant cold component, the outer part of our model is dominated by warm
orbits, representing an exponential thick disc. Our orbital analysis also
confirm the existence of a counter-rotating orbital substructure in the very
centre, reported in previous observational studies. By comparing our model with
a variety of simulation studies, and considering the stellar kinematics and
populations properties of this galaxy, we suggest that the thick disc is most
likely a dynamically heated structure, formed through the interactions and
accretion of satellite(s) with near-polar initial inclination. We also suggest
a merger-driven process as the most plausible scenario to explain the observed
and dynamically-modelled properties of the bulge of NGC 7457. We conclude that
both the high level of cylindrical rotation and unusually low velocity
dispersion reported for the NGC 7457 have most-likely external origins.
Therefore, NGC 7457 could be considered as a candidate for merger-driven
cylindrical rotation in the absence of a strong bar in disc galaxies.

two stars have identical compositions (within 0.13 dex or 1.2 sigma) among all
elements detected. Both stars are very metal poor ([Fe/H] = -2.92 +/- 0.06).
Neither star is highly enhanced in C ([C/Fe] < +1.0). Both stars are enhanced
in the alpha elements Mg, Si, and Ca ([alpha/Fe] = +0.32 +/- 0.06), and ratios
among Na, Al, and all Fe-group elements are typical for other stars in the halo
and ultra-faint and dwarf spheroidal galaxies at this metallicity. Sr is mildly
enhanced ([Sr/Fe] = +0.22 +/- 0.11), but Ba is not enhanced ([Ba/Fe] < -0.4),
indicating that these stars do not contain high levels of neutron-capture
elements. The Li abundances match those found in metal-poor unevolved field
stars and globular clusters (log epsilon (Li) = 2.05 +/- 0.07), which implies
that environment is not a dominant factor in determining the Li content of
metal-poor stars. The chemical compositions of these two stars cannot
distinguish whether the progenitor of the Sylgr stream was a dwarf galaxy or a
globular cluster. If the progenitor was a dwarf galaxy, the stream may
originate from a dense region such as a nuclear star cluster. If the progenitor
was a globular cluster, it would be the most metal-poor globular cluster known.

Title:Renormalisation of linear halo bias in N-body simulations,"
Abstract:  The interpretation of redshift surveys requires modeling the relationship
between large-scale fluctuations in the observed number density of tracers,
$\delta_\mathrm{h}$, and the underlying matter density, $\delta$. Bias models
often express $\delta_\mathrm{h}$ as a truncated series of integro-differential
operators acting on $\delta$, each weighted by a bias parameter. Due to the
presence of `composite operators' (obtained by multiplying fields evaluated at
the same spatial location), the linear bias parameter measured from clustering
statistics does not coincide with that appearing in the bias expansion. This
issue can be cured by re-writing the expansion in terms of `renormalised'
operators. After providing a pedagogical and comprehensive review of bias
renormalisation in perturbation theory, we generalize the concept to
non-perturbative dynamics and successfully apply it to dark-matter haloes
extracted from a large suite of N-body simulations. When comparing numerical
and perturbative results, we highlight the effect of the window function
employed to smooth the random fields. We then measure the bias parameters as a
function of halo mass by fitting a non-perturbative bias model (both before and
after applying renormalisation) to the cross spectrum
$P_{\delta_\mathrm{h}\delta}(k)$. Finally, we employ Bayesian model selection
to determine the optimal operator set to describe
$P_{\delta_\mathrm{h}\delta}(k)$ for $k<0.2\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at redshift $z=0$.
We find that it includes $\delta, \nabla^2\delta, \delta^2$ and the square of
the traceless tidal tensor, $s^2$. Considering higher-order terms (in $\delta$)
leads to overfitting as they cannot be precisely constrained by our data. We
also notice that next-to-leading-order perturbative solutions are inaccurate
for $k\gtrsim 0.1\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

Title:Screened Fifth Forces Mediated by Dark Matter-Baryon Interactions: Theory and Astrophysical Probes,"
Abstract:  We derive the details of a new screening mechanism where the interactions of
baryons and dark matter can be screened according to the local dark matter
density. In this mechanism, the value of Newton's constant is dark matter
density-dependent, allowing for the possibility that astrophysical phenomena
are very different in galaxies less dense than the Milky Way. The parameterized
post Newtonian parameter $\gamma$, which quantifies the difference between
kinematical and lensing probes, also depends on dark matter density. We
calculate the effects of varying $G$ on various stages of stellar evolution,
focusing on observables that impact cosmology: the Cepheid period--luminosity
relation and the supernova Ia magnitude--redshift relation. Other potential
tests of the model are also investigated including main-sequence, post-main
sequence, and low mass dwarf stars. Finally, we discuss how extragalactic tests
of $\gamma$ could provide complementary constraints.

Title:A local resolution of the Hubble tension: The impact of screened fifth forces on the cosmic distance ladder,"
Abstract:  The discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ derived from
the local distance ladder and the cosmic microwave background provides a
tantalising hint of new physics. We explore a potential resolution involving
screened fifth forces in the local Universe, which alter the Cepheid
calibration of supernova distances. In particular, if the Cepheids with direct
distance measurements from parallax or water masers are screened but a
significant fraction of those in other galaxies are not, neglecting the
difference between their underlying period--luminosity relations biases the
local $H_0$ measurement high. This difference derives from a reduction in the
Cepheid pulsation period and possible increase in luminosity under a fifth
force. We quantify the internal and environmental gravitational properties of
the Riess et al. distance ladder galaxies to assess their degrees of screening
under a range of phenomenological models, and propagate this information into
the $H_0$ posterior as a function of fifth force strength. We consider
well-studied screening models in scalar--tensor gravity theories such as
chameleon, K-mouflage and Vainshtein, along with a recently-proposed mechanism
based on baryon--dark matter interactions in which screening is governed by
local dark matter density. We find that a fifth force strength $\sim5-30\%$
that of gravity can alleviate (though not resolve) the $H_0$ tension in some
scenarios, around the sensitivity level at which tests based on other distance
ladder data can constrain this strength. Although our analysis is exploratory
and based on screening models not necessarily realised in full theories, our
results demonstrate that new physics-based local resolutions of the $H_0$
tension are possible, supplementing those already known in the
pre-recombination era.

Title:Time-average properties of $z \sim 0.6$ major mergers: mergers significantly scatter high-z scaling relations,"
Abstract:  Interpreting the scaling relations measured by recent large kinematic surveys
of $z < 1$ galaxies has remained hampered by large observational scatter. We
show that the observed ISM and morpho-dynamical properties along the average $z
\sim 0.6$ major merger describe a very self-consistent picture in which star
formation is enhanced during first passage and fusion as a result of
gravitational perturbations due to the interaction, while the gas velocity
dispersion is simultaneously enhanced through shocks that convert kinematic
energy associated with bulk orbital motions into turbulence at small scales.
Angular momentum and rotation support in the disc are partly lost during the
most perturbing phases, resulting in a morphologically compact phase. The
fractions of present-day E/S0 versus later type galaxies can be predicted
within only a few per cent, confirming that roughly half of local discs were
reformed in the past 8-9 Gyr after gas-rich major mergers. Major mergers are
shown to strongly scatter scaling relations involving kinematic quantities
(e.g. the Tully-Fisher or Fall relations). Selecting high-z discs relying only
on $V/{\sigma}$ turns out to be less efficient than selecting discs from
multiple criteria based on their morpho-kinematic properties, which can reduce
the scatter of high-z scaling relations down to the values measured in local
galaxy samples.

Title:CHANG-ES XVI: An in-depth view of the cosmic-ray transport in the edge-on spiral galaxies NGC 891 and NGC 4565,"
Abstract:  Cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) originating from the star-forming discs of spiral
galaxies frequently form extended radio haloes that are best observable in
edge-on galaxies. For the present study we selected two nearby edge-on galaxies
from the CHANG-ES survey, NGC 891 and 4565, which differ largely in halo size
and SFR. To figure out how such differences are related to the CRE transport in
disc and halo, we use wide-band 1.5 and 6 GHz VLA observations obtained in the
B, C, and D configurations, and combine the 6 GHz images with Effelsberg
observations to correct for missing short spacings. We study the spatially
resolved non-thermal spectral index distribution in terms of CRE spectral
ageing, compute total magnetic field strengths assuming energy equipartition
between CRs and magnetic fields, and also determine synchrotron scale heights.
Based on the vertical profiles of synchrotron intensity and spectral index, we
create purely advective and purely diffusive CRE transport models by
numerically solving the 1D diffusion-loss equation. In particular, we
investigate for the first time the radial dependence of synchrotron and
magnetic field scale heights, advection speeds and diffusion coefficients in
these two galaxies. We find the spectral index distribution of NGC 891 to be
mostly consistent with continuous CRE injection, while in NGC 4565 the local
synchrotron spectra are more in line with discrete-epoch CRE injection (JP or
KP models). This implies that CRE injection timescales are lower than the
synchrotron cooling timescales. The scale height of NGC 891 increases with
radius, indicating that synchrotron losses are significant. NGC 891 is probably
dominated by advective CRE transport at a velocity of
$\gtrsim150\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. In contrast, NGC 4565 is diffusion-dominated
up to $z=1$ kpc or higher, with a diffusion coefficient of
$\geq2\times10^{28}\,\mathrm{cm^2\,s^{-1}}$.

Abstract:  We report results of numerical relativity simulations for {\it new} 26
non-spinning binary neutron star systems with 6 grid resolutions using an
adaptive mesh refinement numerical re\ lativity code {\tt SACRA-MPI}. The
finest grid spacing is $\approx 64$--$85$ m, depending on the systems. First,
we derive long-term high-precision inspiral gravitational waveforms and show
that the accumulated gravitational-wave phase error due to the finite grid
resolution is less than $0.5$ rad during more than $200$ rad phase evolution
irrespective of the systems. We also find that the gravitational-wave phase
error for a binary system with a tabulated equation of state (EOS) is
comparable to that for a piecewise polytropic EOS. Then we validate the SACRA
inspiral gravitational waveform template, which will be used to extract tidal
deformability from gravitational wave observation, and find that accuracy of \
our waveform modeling is $\lesssim 0.1$ rad in the gravitational-wave phase and
$\lesssim 20 \%$ in the gravitational-wave amplitude up to the
gravitational-wave frequency $1000$ Hz.\
Finally, we calibrate the proposed universal relations between a post-merger
gravitational wave signal and tidal deformability/neutron star radius in the
literature and show that th\ ey suffer from systematics and many relations
proposed as universal are not very universal. Improved fitting formulae are
also proposed.

Title:The multiphase gas structure and kinematics in the circumnuclear region of NGC 5728,"
Abstract:  We report on our combined analysis of HST, VLT/MUSE, VLT/SINFONI, and ALMA
observations of the local Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC 5728 to investigate in detail
the feeding and feedback of the AGN. The datasets simultaneously probe the
morphology, excitation, and kinematics of the stars, ionized gas, and molecular
gas over a large range of spatial scales (10 pc--10 kpc). NGC 5728 contains a
large stellar bar which is driving gas along prominent dust lanes to the inner
1 kpc where the gas settles into a circumnuclear ring. The ring is strongly
star forming and contains a substantial population of young stars as indicated
by the lowered stellar velocity dispersion and gas excitation consistent with
HII regions. We model the kinematics of the ring using the velocity field of
the CO (2--1) emission and stars and find it is consistent with a rotating
disk. The outer regions of the disk, where the dust lanes meet the ring, show
signatures of inflow at a rate of 1 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$. Inside the ring, we
observe three molecular gas components corresponding to the circular rotation
of the outer ring, a warped disk, and the nuclear stellar bar. The AGN is
driving an ionized gas outflow that reaches a radius of 250 pc with a mass
outflow rate of 0.08 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ consistent with its luminosity and
scaling relations from previous studies. While we observe distinct holes in CO
emission which could be signs of molecular gas removal, we find that largely
the AGN is not disrupting the structure of the circumnuclear region.

Title:Towards a characterization of X-ray galaxy clusters for cosmology,"
Abstract:  In the framework of the hierarchical model the intra-cluster medium
properties of galaxy clusters are tightly linked to structure formation, which
makes X-ray surveys well suited for cosmological studies. To constrain
cosmological parameters accurately by use of galaxy clusters in X-ray surveys,
a better understanding of selection effects related to the detection method is
needed. We aim at a better understanding of galaxy cluster morphologies to
include corrections between the different core types and covariances with X-ray
luminosities in selection functions. We stress the morphological deviations
between a newly described surface brightness (SB) profile characterization and
a commonly used single $\beta$-model. We investigate a novel approach to
describe SB profiles, where the excess cool-core emission in the galaxy cluster
centres is modelled using wavelet decomposition. Morphological parameters and
the residuals are compared to classical single $\beta$-models. Using single
$\beta$-models to describe the ensemble of overall SB profiles leads on average
to a non-zero bias ($0.032 \pm 0.003$) in the outer part of the clusters, i.e.
a $\sim 3\%$ systematic difference in the SB at large radii. In addition
$\beta$-models show a general trend towards underestimating the flux in the
outskirts for smaller core radii. Fixing the $\beta$ parameter to $2/3$ doubles
the bias and increases the residuals from a single $\beta$-model up to more
than $40\%$. Modelling the core region in the fitting procedure reduces the
impact of these two effects significantly. We find a positive scaling between
shape parameters and temperature, as well as a negative correlation
($\sim-0.4$) between extent and luminosity. Our non-parametric analysis of the
self-similar scaled emission measure profiles indicates no systematic core-type
differences of median profiles in the galaxy clusters outskirts.

Title:Observational constraints on dust disk sizes in tidally truncated protoplanetary disks in multiple systems in the Taurus region,"
Abstract:  The impact of stellar multiplicity on the evolution of planet-forming disks
is still the subject of debate. Here we present and analyze disk structures
around ten multiple stellar systems that were included in an unbiased, high
spatial resolution survey performed with ALMA of 32 protoplanetary disks in the
Taurus star-forming region. At the unprecedented spatial resolution of ~0.12""
we detect and spatially resolve the disks around all primary stars, and those
around eight secondary and one tertiary star. The dust radii of disks around
multiple stellar systems are smaller than those around single stars in the same
stellar mass range and in the same region. The disks in multiple stellar
systems also show a steeper decay of the millimeter continuum emission at the
outer radius than disks around single stars, suggestive of the impact of tidal
truncation on the shape of the disks in multiple systems. However, the observed
ratio between the dust disk radii and the observed separation of the stars in
the multiple systems is consistent with analytic predictions of the effect of
tidal truncation only if the eccentricities of the binaries are rather high
(typically >0.5), or if the observed dust radii are a factor of two smaller
than the gas radii, as is typical for isolated systems. Similar high-resolution
studies targeting the gaseous emission from disks in multiple stellar systems
are required to resolve this question.

Abstract:  We present IRAM-30m Telescope $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO observations of a
sample of 55 luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) in
the local universe. This sample is a subset of the Great Observatory All-Sky
LIRG Survey (GOALS), for which we use ancillary multi-wavelength data to better
understand their interstellar medium and star formation properties. Fifty-three
(96%) of the galaxies are detected in $^{12}$CO, and 29 (52%) are also detected
in $^{13}$CO above a 3$\sigma$ level. The median full width at zero intensity
(FWZI) velocity of the CO line emission is 661km s$^{-1}$, and $\sim$54% of the
galaxies show a multi-peak CO profile. Herschel photometric data is used to
construct the far-IR spectral energy distribution of each galaxy, which are fit
with a modified blackbody model that allows us to derive dust temperatures and
masses, and infrared luminosities. We make the assumption that the gas-to-dust
mass ratio of (U)LIRGs is comparable to local spiral galaxies with a similar
stellar mass (i.e., gas/dust of mergers is comparable to their progenitors) to
derive a CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor of
$\langle\alpha\rangle=1.8^{+1.3}_{-0.8}M_\odot$(K km s$^{-1}$pc$^{2}$)$^{-1}$;
such a value is comparable to that derived for (U)LIRGs based on dynamical mass
arguments. We derive gas depletion times of $400-600$Myr for the (U)LIRGs,
compared to the 1.3Gyr for local spiral galaxies. Finally, we re-examine the
relationship between the $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio and dust temperature,
confirming a transition to elevated ratios in warmer systems.

Title:Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Project. VIII. Time Variability of Emission and Absorption in NGC 5548 Based on Modeling the Ultraviolet Spectrum,"
Abstract:  We model the ultraviolet spectra of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC~5548 obtained
with the Hubble Space Telescope during the 6-month reverberation-mapping
campaign in 2014. Our model of the emission from NGC 5548 corrects for
overlying absorption and deblends the individual emission lines. Using the
modeled spectra, we measure the response to continuum variations for the
deblended and absorption-corrected individual broad emission lines, the
velocity-dependent profiles of Ly$\alpha$ and C IV, and the narrow and broad
intrinsic absorption features. We find that the time lags for the corrected
emission lines are comparable to those for the original data. The
velocity-binned lag profiles of Ly$\alpha$ and C IV have a double-peaked
structure indicative of a truncated Keplerian disk. The narrow absorption lines
show delayed response to continuum variations corresponding to recombination in
gas with a density of $\sim 10^5~\rm cm^{-3}$. The high-ionization narrow
absorption lines decorrelate from continuum variations during the same period
as the broad emission lines. Analyzing the response of these absorption lines
during this period shows that the ionizing flux is diminished in strength
relative to the far-ultraviolet continuum. The broad absorption lines
associated with the X-ray obscurer decrease in strength during this same time
interval. The appearance of X-ray obscuration in $\sim\,2012$ corresponds with
an increase in the luminosity of NGC 5548 following an extended low state. We
suggest that the obscurer is a disk wind triggered by the brightening of NGC
5548 following the decrease in size of the broad-line region during the
preceding low-luminosity state.

Title:Evolution of star formation rate-density relation over cosmic time in a simulated universe: the observed reversal reproduced,"
Abstract:  We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to study the
evolution of star formation rate (SFR)-density relation over cosmic time. We
construct several samples of galaxies at different redshifts from $z=2.0$ to
$z=0.0$, which have the same comoving number density. The SFR of galaxies
decreases with local density at $z=0.0$, but its dependence on local density
becomes weaker with redshift. At $z\gtrsim1.0$, the SFR of galaxies increases
with local density (reversal of the SFR-density relation), and its dependence
becomes stronger with redshift. This change of SFR-density relation with
redshift still remains even when fixing the stellar masses of galaxies. The
dependence of SFR on the distance to a galaxy cluster also shows a change with
redshift in a way similar to the case based on local density, but the reversal
happens at a higher redshift, $z\sim1.5$, in clusters. On the other hand, the
molecular gas fraction always decreases with local density regardless of
redshift at $z=0.0-2.0$ even though the dependence becomes weaker when we fix
the stellar mass. Our study demonstrates that the observed reversal of the
SFR-density relation at $z\gtrsim1.0$ can be successfully reproduced in
cosmological simulations. Our results are consistent with the idea that
massive, star-forming galaxies are strongly clustered at high redshifts,
forming larger structures. These galaxies then consume their gas faster than
those in low-density regions through frequent interactions with other galaxies,
ending up being quiescent in the local universe.

z-transformed discrete correlation function (zDCF), von Neumann estimator, and

(BLR) size -- monochromatic luminosity power-law scaling, $R_{\rm BLR}\propto
L_{5100}^{1/2}$, which was already confirmed for low-redshift sources. In case
the BLR size-luminosity relation holds for other distant sources, quasars could

Title:Simulations of a High-Contrast Single-Mode Fiber Coronagraphic Multi-Object Spectrograph for Future Space Telescopes,"
Abstract:  Directly imaging and characterizing Earth-like exoplanets is a tremendously
difficult instrumental challenge. Present coronagraphic systems have yet to
achieve the required $10^{-10}$ broadband contrast in a laboratory environment,
but promising progress towards this goal continues. A new approach to starlight
suppression is the use of a single-mode fiber behind a coronagraph. By using
deformable mirrors to create a mismatch between incoming starlight and the

starlight suppression system. In this paper, we present simulation results of a
system with five single-mode fibers coupled to shaped pupil and vortex
coronagraphs. We investigate the properties of the system, including its
spectral bandwidth, throughput, and sensitivity to low-order aberrations. We
also compare the performance of the single-mode fiber configuration with
conventional imaging and multi-object modes, finding improved spectral
bandwidth, raw contrast, background-limited SNR, and demonstrate a wavefront
control algorithm which is robust to tip/tilt errors.

Title:The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and smoothed particle hydrodynamics,"
Abstract:  We perform simulations of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability using smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The instability is studied both in the linear and
strongly non-linear regimes. The smooth, well-posed initial conditions of
Lecoanet et al. (2016) are used, along with an explicit Navier-Stokes viscosity
and thermal conductivity to enforce the evolution in the non-linear regime. We
demonstrate convergence to the reference solution using SPH. The evolution of
the vortex structures and the degree of mixing, as measured by a passive scalar
`colour' field, match the reference solution. Tests with an initial density
contrast produce the correct qualitative behaviour. The L2 error of the SPH
calculations decreases as the resolution is increased. The primary source of
error is numerical dissipation arising from artificial viscosity, and tests
with reduced artificial viscosity have reduced L2 error. A high-order smoothing
kernel is needed in order to resolve the initial velocity amplitude of the
seeded mode and inhibit excitation of spurious modes. We find that standard SPH
with an artificial viscosity has no difficulty in correctly modelling the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and yields convergent solutions.

Abstract:  Aims. We aim to constrain the size and porosity of ejected dust particles
from comet 252P/LINEAR and their evolution near the perihelion via
near-infrared multiband polarimetry. A close approach of the comet to the Earth
in March 2016 (~0.036 au) provided a rare opportunity for the sampling of the
comet with a high spatial resolution. Methods. We made NIR JHKS bands
polarimetric observations of the comet for 12 days near perihelion,
interspersed between broadband optical imaging observations over four months.
In addition, dynamical simulation of the comet was performed 1000 yr backward
in time. Results. We detected two discontinuous brightness enhancements. Before
the first enhancement, the NIR polarization degrees were far lower than those
of ordinary comets at a given phase angle. Soon after the activation, however,
they increased by ~13 % at most, showing unusual blue polarimetric color over
the J and H bands (-2.55 % / um on average) and bluing of both J-H and H-Ks
dust color. Throughout the event, the polarization vector was marginally
aligned perpendicular to the scattering plane. The subsequent postperihelion
reactivation of the comet lasted for approximately 1.5 months, with a factor of
~30 times pre-activation dust mass-loss rates in the Rc band. Conclusions. The
marked increase in the polarization degree with blue NIR polarimetric color is
reminiscent of the behaviors of a fragmenting comet D/1999 S4 (LINEAR). The
most plausible scenario for the observed polarimetric properties of 252P/LINEAR
would be an ejection of predominantly large, compact dust particles from the
desiccated surface layer. We conjecture that the more intense solar heating
that the comet has received in the near-Earth orbit would cause the paucity of
small, fluffy dust particles around the nucleus of the comet.

Title:Self-supervised Learning with Physics-aware Neural Networks I: Galaxy Model Fitting,"
Abstract:  Estimating the parameters of a model describing a set of observations using a
neural network is in general solved in a supervised way. In cases when we do
not have access to the model's true parameters this approach can not be
applied. Standard unsupervised learning techniques on the other hand, do not
produce meaningful or semantic representations that can be associated to the
model's parameters. Here we introduce a self-supervised hybrid network that
combines traditional neural network elements with analytic or numerical models
which represent a physical process to be learned by the system. Self-supervised
learning is achieved by generating an internal representation equivalent to the
parameters of the physical model. This semantic representation is used to
evaluate the model and compare it to the input data during training. The
Semantic Autoencoder architecture described here shares the robustness of
neural networks while including an explicit model of the data, learns in an
unsupervised way and estimates, by construction, parameters with direct
physical interpretation. As an illustrative application we perform unsupervised
learning for 2D model fitting of exponential light profiles.

Abstract:  We investigate the common envelope binary interaction, that leads to the
formation of compact binaries, such as the progenitor of Type Ia supernovae or
of mergers that emit detectable gravitational waves. In this work we diverge
from the classic numerical approach that models the dynamic in-spiral. We focus
instead on the asymptotic behaviour of the common envelope expansion after the
dynamic in-spiral terminates. We use the SPH code {\sc phantom} to simulate one
of the setups from Passy et al., with a 0.88~\ms, 83~\rs \ RGB primary and a
0.6~\ms \ companion, then we follow the ejecta expansion for $\simeq 50$~yr.
Additionally, we utilise a tabulated equation of state including the envelope
recombination energy in the simulation (Reichardt et al.), achieving a full
unbinding. We show that, as time passes, the envelope's radial velocities
dominate over the tangential ones, hence allowing us to apply an homologous
expansion kinematic model to the ejecta. The external layers of the envelope
become homologous as soon as they are ejected, but it takes $\simeq 5000$~days
($\simeq 14$~yr) for the bulk of the unbound gas to achieve an homologous
expanding regime. We observe that the complex distribution generated by the
dynamic in-spiral evolves into a more ordered, ring-like shaped one in the
asymptotic regime. We show that the thermodynamics of the expanding envelope
are in very good agreement with those expected for an adiabatically expanding
sphere under the homologous condition and give a prediction for the location
and temperature of the photosphere assuming dust to be the main source of
opacity.

scaling relationship based on the redshift {with respect to the quasar's rest

this feature in the spectra of a well suited sample of quasars, observed with
X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), whose masses have been
independently estimated using the virial theorem. For the quasars of this
sample we consistently confirm the redshift of the Fe
III$\lambda\lambda$2039-2113 blend and find that it correlates with the squared
widths of H$\beta$, H$\alpha$ and Mg II, which are commonly used as a measure
of $M_{BH}/R$ to determine masses from the virial theorem. The average
differences between virial and Fe III$\lambda\lambda$2039-2113 redshift based
masses are 0.18$\pm 0.21$ dex, 0.18$\pm 0.22$ dex and 0.14$\pm 0.21$ dex, when
the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\beta$, H$\alpha$ and MgII
lines are, respectively, used. The difference is reduced to 0.10$\pm 0.16$ dex
when the standard deviation, $\sigma$, of {the} MgII line is used, instead. We
also study the high S/N composite quasar spectra of the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), finding that the Fe III$\lambda\lambda$2039-2113

variability is mainly due to the rotational modulation of dark photospheric
spots and active regions, as in main sequence stars even if associated with a
stronger magnetic activity. Aims. We aim at analyzing the simultaneous optical
and X-ray variability in these stars to unveil how the activity in the
photosphere is connected with that in the corona, to identify the dominant
surface magnetic activity, and to correlate our results with stellar
properties, such as rotation and mass. Methods. We analyzed the simultaneous
optical and X-ray variability in stars without inner disks (e.g., class III
objects and stars with transition disks) in NGC 2264 from observations obtained
with Chandra/ACIS-I and CoRoT as part of the Coordinated Synoptic Investigation
of NGC 2264. We searched for those stars whose optical and X-ray variability is
correlated, anti-correlated, or not correlated by sampling their optical and
X-ray light curves in suitable time intervals and studying the correlation
between the flux observed in optical and in X-rays. We then studied how this
classification is related with stellar properties. Results. Starting from a
sample of 74 class III/transition disk (TD) stars observed with CoRoT and
detected with Chandra with more than 60 counts, we selected 16 stars whose
optical and X-ray variability is anti-correlated, 11 correlated, and 17 where
there is no correlation. The remaining stars did not fall in any of these
groups. We interpreted the anti-correlated optical and X-ray variability as
typical of spot-dominated sources, due to the rotational modulation of
photospheric spots spatially coincident to coronal active regions, and
correlated variability typical of faculae-dominated sources, where the
brightening due to faculae is dominant over the darkening due to spots.

Title:The impact of cosmic rays on the sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec,"
Abstract:  The focal plane of the NIRSpec instrument on board the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) is equipped with two Teledyne H2RG near-IR detectors,
state-of-the-art HgCdTe sensors with excellent noise performance. Once JWST is
in space, however, the noise level in NIRSpec exposures will be affected by the
cosmic ray (CR) fluence at the JWST orbit and our ability to detect CR hits and
to mitigate their effect. We have simulated the effect of CRs on NIRSpec
detectors by injecting realistic CR events onto dark exposures that were
recently acquired during the JWST cryo-vacuum test campaign undertaken at
Johnson Space Flight Center. Here we present the method we have implemented to
detect the hits in the exposure integration cubes, to reject the affected data
points within our ramp-to-slope processing pipeline (the prototype of the
NIRSpec official pipeline), and assess the performance of this method for
different choices of the algorithm parameters. Using the optimal parameter set
to reject CR hits from the data, we estimate that, for an exposure length of
1,000 s, the presence of CRs in space will lead to an increase of typically ~7%
in the detector noise level with respect to the on-ground performance, and the
corresponding decrease in the limiting sensitivity of the instrument, for the
medium and high-spectral resolution modes.

Title:Primordial black holes dark matter from inflection point models of inflation and the effects of reheating,"
Abstract:  We study the generation of primordial black holes (PBH) in a single field
inflection point model of inflation wherein the effective potential is expanded
up to the sextic order and the inversion symmetry is imposed such that only
even powers are retained in the potential. Such a potential allows the
existence of an inflection point which leads to a dynamical phase of ultra slow
roll evolution, thereby causing an enhancement of the primordial perturbation
spectrum at smaller scales. Working with a quasi-inflection point in the
potential, we find that PBHs can be produced in our scenario in the
asteroid-mass window with a nearly monochromatic mass fraction which can
account for the total dark matter in the universe. For different choices of
quasi-inflection points and other parameters of our model, we can also generate
PBHs in higher mass windows but the primordial spectrum of curvature
perturbations becomes strongly tilted at the CMB scales. Moreover, we study the
effects of a reheating epoch after the end of inflation on the PBHs mass
fraction and find that an epoch of a matter dominated reheating can shift the
mass fraction to a larger mass window as well as increase their fractional
contribution to the total dark matter even for the case of a monochromatic mass
fraction.

Title:Feasibility of Cosmic Microwave Background Observations using Radiometers based on Whispering Gallery Mode Resonators,"
Abstract:  The fundamentals of the whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators are well
established in the literature, with several successful proof-of-concept
experiments. One remarkable benefit of this technology is the room-temperature
operation. This characteristic could be used to build a new generation of
radiometers that do not need to be cooled down to cryogenic temperatures to
reach high sensitivities. In this article, a study of the viability of
technological transfer is undertaken, beginning with a brief review of the
theoretical background that will be applied and leading to a proposal for a
novel spectro-polarimeter design. Simulations for a radiometer based on WGM
resonance are analyzed and compared with state-of-the-art coherent receivers.
The results are then discussed, finding that although promising, WGM technology
needs R\&D in several directions in order to be competitive, whose are
suggested by the authors with the idea of inspiring the work of the researchers
in the field towards a new direction or approach.

Title:AMS-100: The Next Generation Magnetic Spectrometer in Space -- An International Science Platform for Physics and Astrophysics at Lagrange Point 2,"
Abstract:  The next generation magnetic spectrometer in space, AMS-100, is designed to
have a geometrical acceptance of $100\,\mathrm{m}^2\,\mathrm{sr}$ and to be
operated for at least ten years at the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 2. Compared to
existing experiments, it will improve the sensitivity for the observation of
new phenomena in cosmic rays, and in particular in cosmic antimatter, by at
least a factor of 1000. The magnet design is based on high temperature
superconductor tapes, which allow the construction of a thin solenoid with a
homogeneous magnetic field of 1 Tesla inside. The inner volume is instrumented
with a silicon tracker reaching a maximum detectable rigidity of 100 TV and a
calorimeter system that is 70 radiation lengths deep, equivalent to four
nuclear interaction lengths, which extends the energy reach for cosmic-ray
nuclei up to the PeV scale, i.e. beyond the cosmic-ray knee. Covering most of
the sky continuously, AMS-100 will detect high-energy gamma rays in the
calorimeter system and by pair conversion in the thin solenoid, reconstructed
with excellent angular resolution in the silicon tracker.

Title:A Surface Radio Array for the Enhancement of IceTop and its Science Prospects,"
Abstract:  Radio detection of air showers in the current era has progressed immensely to
effectively extract the properties of these air showers. Primary cosmic rays
with energies of hundreds of PeV have been successfully measured with the
method of radio detection. There are also attempts to observe high-energy
neutrinos with this technique. Current radio experiments measuring cosmic-ray
air showers mostly operate in the frequency range of 30-80 MHz. An optimization
of the frequency band of operation can be done for maximizing the
signal-to-noise ratio that can be achieved by an array of radio antennas at the
South Pole, operated along with IceTop. Such an array can improve the
reconstruction of air showers performed with IceTop. The prospect of using such
an optimized radio array for measuring gamma rays of PeV energies from the
Galactic Center is discussed.

Title:Evolution of ONeMg Core in Super-AGB Stars towards Electron-Capture Supernovae: Effects of Updated Electron-Capture Rate,"
Abstract:  Stars with $\sim 8-10~{M}_{\odot}$ evolve to form a strongly degenerate ONeMg
core. When the core mass becomes close to the Chandrasekhar mass, the core
undergoes electron captures on $^{24}$Mg and $^{20}$Ne, which induce the
electron-capture supernova (ECSN). In order to clarify whether the ECSN leads
to a collapse or thermonuclear explosion, we calculate the evolution of an
$8.4~M_\odot$ star from the main sequence until the oxygen ignition in the
ONeMg core. We apply the latest electron-capture rate on $^{20}$Ne including
the second forbidden transition, and investigate how the location of the oxygen
ignition (center or off-center) and the $Y_e$ distribution depend on the input
physics and the treatment of the semiconvection and convection. The central
density when the oxygen deflagration is initiated, $\rho_{\rm c,def}$, can be
significantly higher than that of the oxygen ignition thanks to the convection,
and we estimate $\log_{10}(\rho_{\rm c,def}/\mathrm{g~cm^{-3}})>10.10$. We
perform two-dimensional simulations of the flame propagation to examine how the
final fate of the ONeMg core depends on the $Y_e$ distribution and $\rho_{\rm
c,def}$. We find that the deflagration starting from $\log_{10}(\rho_{\rm
c,def}/\mathrm{g~cm^{-3}})>10.01 (< 10.01)$ leads to a collapse (thermonuclear
explosion). Since our estimate of $\rho_{\rm c,def}$ exceeds this critical
value, the ONeMg core is likely to collapse, although further studies of the
convection and semiconvection before the deflagration are important.

Title:Bulk viscosity of baryonic matter with trapped neutrinos,"
Abstract:  We study bulk viscosity arising from weak current Urca processes in dense
baryonic matter at and beyond nuclear saturation density. We consider the
temperature regime where neutrinos are trapped and therefore have nonzero
chemical potential. We model the nuclear matter in a relativistic density
functional approach, taking into account the trapped neutrino component. We
find that the resonant maximum of the bulk viscosity would occur at or below
the neutrino trapping temperature, so in the neutrino trapped regime the bulk
viscosity decreases with temperature as $T^{-2}$, this decrease being
interrupted by a drop to zero at a special temperature where the proton
fraction becomes density-independent and the material scale-invariant. The bulk
viscosity is larger for matter with lower lepton fraction, i.e., larger isospin
asymmetry. We find that bulk viscosity in the neutrino-trapped regime is
smaller by several orders of magnitude than in the neutrino-transparent regime,
which implies that bulk viscosity in neutrino-trapped matter is probably not
strong enough to affect significantly the evolution of neutron star mergers.
This also implies weak damping of gravitational waves emitted by the
oscillations of the postmerger remnant in the high-temperature,
neutrino-trapped phase of evolution.

Title:Spins of black holes in coalescing compact binaries,"
Abstract:  Modern astrophysical methods of determination of spins of rotating
stellar-mass black hole in close binaries and of supermassive black holes in
active galactic nuclei are briefly discussed. Effective spins of coalescing
binary black holes derived from LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave observations are
specially addressed. We consider three types of coalescing binaries: double
black holes, black hole-neutron star binaries and primordial double black
holes. The effective spins of coalescing astrophysical binary black holes and
black holes with neutron stars are calculated for two plausible models of black
hole formations from stellar core collapses (without or with additional
fallback from the stellar envelope) taking into account the stellar metallicity
and star formation rate evolution in the Universe. The calculated distributions
do not contradict the reported LIGO/Virgo observations. The effective spins of
primordial coalescing stellar-mass black holes can reach a few per cent due to
accretion spin-up in the cold external medium.

"Title:Fragmentation, rotation and outflows in the high-mass star-forming region IRAS 23033+5951. A case study of the IRAM NOEMA large program CORE","
Abstract:  The formation process of high-mass stars (>8M$_\odot$) is poorly constrained,
particularly, the effects of clump fragmentation creating multiple systems and
the mechanism of mass accretion onto the cores. We study the fragmentation of
dense gas clumps, and trace the circumstellar rotation and outflows by
analyzing observations of the high-mass (~500M$_\odot$) star-forming region
IRAS 23033+5951. Using the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) in three
configurations and the IRAM 30-m single-dish telescope at 220GHz, we probe the
gas and dust emission at an angular resolution of ~0.45arcsec, corresponding to
1900au. In the mm continuum emission, we identify a protostellar cluster with
at least four mm-sources, where three of them show a significantly higher peak
intensity well above a signal-to-noise ratio of 100. Hierarchical fragmentation
from large to small spatial scales is discussed. Two fragments are embedded in
rotating structures and drive molecular outflows, traced by $^{13}$CO (2-1)
emission. The velocity profiles across two of the cores are similar to
Keplerian but are missing the highest velocity components close to the center
of rotation, which is a common phenomena from observations like these, and
other rotation scenarios are not excluded entirely. Position-velocity diagrams
suggest protostellar masses of ~6 and 19M$_\sun$. Rotational temperatures from
fitting CH$_3$CN ($12_K-11_K$) spectra are used for estimating the gas
temperature and by that the disk stability against gravitational fragmentation,
utilizing Toomre's $Q$ parameter. [We] identify only one candidate disk to be
unstable against gravitational instability caused by axisymmetric
perturbations. The dominant sources cover different evolutionary stages within
the same maternal gas clump. The appearance of rotation and outflows of the
cores are similar to those found in low-mass star-forming regions.

Title:Primordial black holes from the preheating instability,"
Abstract:  After the end of inflation, the inflaton field oscillates around a local
minimum of its potential and decays into ordinary matter. These oscillations
trigger a resonant instability for cosmological perturbations with wavelengths
that exit the Hubble radius close to the end of inflation. In this paper, we
study the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) at these enhanced scales.
We find that the production mechanism can be so efficient that PBHs
subsequently dominate the content of the universe and reheating proceeds from
their evaporation. Observational constraints on the PBH abundance also restrict
the duration of the resonant instability phase, leading to tight limits on the
reheating temperature that we derive. We conclude that the production of PBHs
during reheating is a generic and inevitable property of the simplest
inflationary models, and does not require any fine tuning of the inflationary
potential.

Title:Lightening the Dark Matter from its Viscosity and Explanation of EDGES Anomaly,"
Abstract:  We study the visible photon production from the viscous dissipation of the
dark matter (DM) fluid. The visible photon production depends on the magnitude
of the dark matter viscosity and becomes important at the late times. We argue
that for sufficiently large dark matter viscosity, the number of the resonantly
converted visible photons becomes large which populates the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ)
tails of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. Consequently, these
excess visible photons possibly can explain the reported EDGES anomaly in the
21 cm signal. Further, we explore the parameter space for which the 21 cm
signal can provide the region to probe the dark radiation and the DM viscosity.

Title:Particle Acceleration and Heating in Regions of Magnetic Flux Emergence,"
Abstract:  The interaction between emerging and pre-existing magnetic fields in the
solar atmosphere can trigger several dynamic phenomena, such as eruptions and
jets. A key element during this interaction is the formation of large scale
current sheets and, eventually, their fragmentation that leads to the creation
of a strongly turbulent environment. In this paper, we study the kinetic
aspects of the interaction (reconnection) between emerging and ambient magnetic
fields. We show that the statistical properties of the spontaneously fragmented
and fractal electric fields are responsible for the efficient heating and
acceleration of charged particles, which form a power law tail at high energies
on sub-second time scales. A fraction of the energized particles escapes from
the acceleration volume, with a super-hot component with temperature close to
$150\,$MK, and with a power law high energy tail with index between -2 and -3.
We estimate the transport coefficients in energy space from the dynamics of the
charged particles inside the fragmented and fractal electric fields, and the
solution of a fractional transport equation, as appropriate for a strongly
turbulent plasma, agrees with the test particle simulations. We also show that
the acceleration mechanism is not related to Fermi acceleration, and the Fokker
Planck equation is inconsistent and not adequate as a transport model. Finally,
we address the problem of correlations between spatial transport and transport
in energy space. Our results confirm the observations reported for high energy
particles (hard X-rays, type III bursts and solar energetic particles) during
the emission of solar jets.

Title:Shock-accelerated cosmic rays and streaming instability in the adaptive mesh refinement code Ramses,"
Abstract:  Cosmic rays (CRs) are thought to play a dynamically important role in several
key aspects of galaxy evolution, including the structure of the interstellar
medium, the formation of galactic winds, and the non-thermal pressure support
of halos. We introduce a numerical model solving for the CR streaming
instability and acceleration of CRs at shocks with a fluid approach in the
adaptive mesh refinement code ramses. CR streaming is solved with a diffusion
approach and its anisotropic nature is naturally captured. We introduce a shock
finder for the ramses code that automatically detects shock discontinuities in
the flow. Shocks are the loci for CR injection, and their efficiency of CR
acceleration is made dependent on the upstream magnetic obliquity according to
the diffuse shock acceleration mechanism. We show that the shock finder
accurately captures shock locations and estimates the shock Mach number for
several problems. The obliquity-dependent injection of CRs in the Sedov
solution leads to situations where the supernova bubble exhibits large polar
caps (homogeneous background magnetic field), or a patchy structure of the CR
distribution (inhomogeneous background magnetic field). Finally, we combine
both accelerated CRs with streaming in a simple turbulent interstellar medium
box, and show that the presence of CRs significantly modifies the structure of
the gas.

Title:Intergalactic Magnetic Fields from First-Order Phase Transitions,"
Abstract:  We study the generation of intergalactic magnetic fields in two models for
first-order phase transitions in the early Universe that have been studied
previously in connection with the generation of gravitational waves (GWs): the
Standard Model supplemented by an $|H|^6$ operator (SM+$H^6$) and a classically
scale-invariant model with an extra gauged U(1) $B - L$ symmetry (SM$_{B-L}$).
We consider contributions to magnetic fields generated by bubble collisions and
by turbulence in the primordial plasma, and we consider the hypotheses that
helicity is seeded in the gauge field or kinetically. We study the conditions
under which the intergalactic magnetic fields generated may be larger than the
lower bounds from blazar observations, and correlate them with the
observability of GWs and possible collider signatures. In the SM+$H^6$ model
bubble collisions alone cannot yield large enough magnetic fields, whereas
turbulence may do so. In the SM$_{B-L}$ model bubble collisions and turbulence
may both yield magnetic fields above the blazar bound unless the B$-$L gauge
boson is very heavy. In both models there may be observable GW and collider
signatures if sufficiently large magnetic fields are generated.

Title:Flipping-up the field: gravitational feedback as a mechanism for young clusters dispersal,"
Abstract:  Recent analyses of Gaia data have provided direct evidence that most young
stellar clusters are in a state of expansion, with velocities of the order of
~0.5 km/s. Traditionally, expanding young clusters have been pictured as
entities that became unbound due to the lack of gravitational binding once the
gas from the parental cloud that formed the cluster has been expelled by the
stellar radiation of the massive stars in the cluster. In the present
contribution, we used radiation-magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of
molecular cloud formation and evolution to understand how stellar clusters form
and disperse. We found that the ionising feedback from the newborn massive
stars expels the gas from the collapse centre, flipping-up the gravitational
potential as a consequence of the mass removal from the inside-out. Since
neither the parental clouds nor the formed shells are distributed symmetrically
around the HII region, net forces pulling out the stars are present,
accelerating them towards the edges of the cavity. We call this mechanism
``gravitational feedback"", in which the gravity from the expelled gas appears
to be the crucial mechanism producing unbound clusters that expand away from
their formation centre in an accelerated way in young stellar clusters. This
mechanism naturally explains the ""Hubble flow-like"" expansion observed in
several young clusters.

Title:Baryon-CDM isocurvature galaxy bias with IllustrisTNG,"
Abstract:  We study the impact that baryon-CDM relative density perturbations
$\delta_{bc}$ have on galaxy formation using cosmological simulations with the
IllustrisTNG model. These isocurvature (non-adiabatic) perturbations can be
induced primordially, if multiple fields are present during inflation, and are
generated before baryon-photon decoupling when baryons did not comove with CDM.
The presence of long-wavelength $\delta_{bc}$ perturbations in our simulations
is mimicked by modifying the ratios of the cosmic densities of baryons
$\Omega_b$ and CDM $\Omega_c$, at fixed total matter density $\Omega_m$. We
measure the corresponding galaxy bias parameter $b_{\delta}^{bc}$ as the
response of galaxy abundances to $\delta_{bc}$. When selecting by total host
halo mass, $b_{\delta}^{bc}$ is negative and it decreases with mass and
redshift. Stellar-mass selected simulated galaxies show a weaker or even the
opposite trend because of the competing effects of $\delta_{bc}$ on the halo
mass function and stellar-to-halo-mass relations. We show that simple modeling
of the latter two effects describes $b_{\delta}^{bc}$ for stellar-mass-selected
objects well. We find $b_{\delta}^{bc} =0.6$ for $M_* = 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}/h$
and $z=0.5$, which is representative of BOSS DR12 galaxies. For $\delta_{bc}$
modes generated by baryon-photon interactions, we estimate the impact on the
DR12 power spectrum to be below $1\%$, and shifts on inferred distance and
growth rate parameters should not exceed $0.1\%$.

distribution of the regions which cover the full extents in the radio continuum
for the individual SNRs are discussed. Four SNRs show significant spatial
coincidences between molecular clouds (MCs) revealed from the 3D extinction
mapping and the corresponding radio features. The results confirm the
interactions between these SNRs and their surrounding MCs. Based on these
correlations, we provide new distance estimates of the four SNRs, G189.1+3.0

Title:Stellar Metallicities and Elemental Abundance Ratios of z~1.4 Massive Quiescent Galaxies,"
Abstract:  The chemical composition of galaxies has been measured out to z~4. However,
nearly all studies beyond z~0.7 are based on strong-line emission from HII
regions within star-forming galaxies. Measuring the chemical composition of
distant quiescent galaxies is extremely challenging, as the required stellar
absorption features are faint and shifted to near-infrared wavelengths. Here,
we present ultra-deep rest-frame optical spectra of five massive quiescent
galaxies at z~1.4, all of which show numerous stellar absorption lines. We
derive the abundance ratios [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H] for three out of five galaxies;
the remaining two galaxies have too young luminosity-weighted ages to yield
robust measurements. Similar to lower-redshift findings, [Mg/Fe] appears
positively correlated with stellar mass, while [Fe/H] is approximately constant
with mass. These results may imply that the stellar mass-metallicity relation
was already in place at z~1.4. While the [Mg/Fe]-mass relation at z~1.4 is
consistent with the z<0.7 relation, [Fe/H] at z~1.4 is ~0.2 dex lower than at
z<0.7. With a [Mg/Fe] of 0.44(+0.08,-0.07) the most massive galaxy may be more
alpha-enhanced than similar-mass galaxies at lower redshift, but the offset is
less significant than the [Mg/Fe] of 0.6 previously found for a massive galaxy
at z=2.1. Nonetheless, these results combined may suggest that [Mg/Fe] in the
most massive galaxies decreases over time, possibly by accreting low-mass, less
alpha-enhanced galaxies. A larger galaxy sample is needed to confirm this
scenario. Finally, the abundance ratios indicate short star-formation
timescales of 0.2-1.0 Gyr.

Title:Universal Interferometric Signatures of a Black Hole's Photon Ring,"
Abstract:  The Event Horizon Telescope image of the supermassive black hole in the
galaxy M87 is dominated by a bright, unresolved ring. General relativity
predicts that embedded within this image lies a thin ""photon ring,"" which is
composed of an infinite sequence of self-similar subrings that are indexed by
the number of photon orbits around the black hole. The subrings approach the
edge of the black hole ""shadow,"" becoming exponentially narrower but weaker
with increasing orbit number, with seemingly negligible contributions from high
order subrings. Here, we show that these subrings produce strong and universal
signatures on long interferometric baselines. These signatures offer the
possibility of precise measurements of black hole mass and spin, as well as
tests of general relativity, using only a sparse interferometric array.

Title:The evolution of kicked stellar-mass black holes in star cluster environments II. Rotating star clusters,"
Abstract:  In this paper, we continue our study on the evolution of black holes (BHs)
that receive velocity kicks at the origin of their host star cluster potential.
We now focus on BHs in rotating clusters that receive a range of kick
velocities in different directions with respect to the rotation axis. We
perform N-body simulations to calculate the trajectories of the kicked BHs and
develop an analytic framework to study their motion as a function of the host
cluster and the kick itself. Our simulations indicate that for a BH that is
kicked outside of the cluster's core, as its orbit decays in a rotating cluster
the BH will quickly gain angular momentum as it interacts with stars with high
rotational frequencies. Once the BH decays to the point where its orbital
frequency equals that of local stars, its orbit will be circular and dynamical
friction becomes ineffective since local stars will have low relative
velocities. After circularization, the BH's orbit decays on a longer timescale
than if the host cluster was not rotating. Hence BHs in rotating clusters will
have longer orbital decay times. The timescale for orbit circularization
depends strongly on the cluster's rotation rate and the initial kick velocity,
with kicked BHs in slowly rotating clusters being able to decay into the core
before circularization occurs. The implication of the circularization phase is
that the probability of a BH undergoing a tidal capture event increases,
possibly aiding in the formation of binaries and high-mass BHs.

weakly with large-scale overdensity and Cosmic Web class. The latter two
quantities correlate with each other, but are not entirely degenerate.
Furthermore, we find that at fixed halo mass, galaxies with stellar mass lower
than the median value are more likely to be found in voids and sheets, whereas
galaxies with stellar mass higher than the median are more likely to be found
in filaments and knots. Finally, we find that the dependence on environment is
stronger for satellites than for centrals, and discuss the physical
implications of these results.

Title:Combining high contrast imaging and radial velocities to constrain the planetary architecture of nearby stars,"
Abstract:  Nearby stars are prime targets for exoplanet searches and characterization
using a variety of detection techniques. Combining constraints from the
complementary detection methods of high contrast imaging (HCI) and radial
velocity (RV) can further constrain the planetary architectures of these
systems because these methods place limits at different regions of the
companion mass and semi-major axis parameter space. We aim to constrain the
planetary architectures from the combination of HCI and RV data for 6 nearby
stars within 6 pc: $\tau$ Ceti, Kapteyn's star, AX Mic, 40 Eri, HD 36395, and
HD 42581. We compiled the sample from stars with available archival VLT/NACO
HCI data at L$^{\prime}$ band (3.8 $\mu$m). The NACO data were fully reanalyzed
using the state-of-the-art direct imaging pipeline PynPoint and combined with
RV data from HARPS, Keck/HIRES, and CORALIE. A Monte Carlo approach was used to
assess the completeness in the companion mass/semi-major axis parameter space
from the combination of the HCI and RV data sets. We find that the HCI data add
significant information to the RV constraints, increasing the completeness for
certain companions masses/semi-major axes by up to 68 - 99% for 4 of the 6
stars in our sample, and by up to 1 - 13% for the remaining stars. The
improvements are strongest for intermediate semi-major axes (15 - 40 AU),
corresponding to the semi-major axes of the ice giants in our own solar system.
The HCI mass limits reach 5 - 20 $M_{\textrm{Jup}}$ in the background-limited
regime, depending on the age of the star. Through the combination of HCI and RV
data, we find that stringent constraints can be placed on the possible
substellar companions in these systems. Applying these methods systematically
to nearby stars will quantify our current knowledge of the planet population in
the solar neighborhood and inform future observations.

Title:Plasmoid-mediated reconnection in solar UV bursts,"
Abstract:  UV bursts are transients in the solar atmosphere with an increased impulsive
emission in the extreme UV lasting for one to several tens of minutes. They
often show spectral profiles indicative of a bi-directional outflow in response
to magnetic reconnection. To understand UV bursts, we study how motions of
magnetic elements at the surface can drive the self-consistent formation of a
current sheet resulting in plasmoid-mediated reconnection. In particular, we
want to study the role of the height of the reconnection in the atmosphere. We
conducted numerical experiments solving the 2D MHD equations from the solar
surface to the upper atmosphere. Motivated by observations, we drove a small
magnetic patch embedded in a larger system of magnetic field of opposite
polarity. This configuration creates an X-type neutral point in the initial
potential field. The models are characterized by the plasma-beta at the height
of this X point. The driving at the surface stretches the X-point into a
current sheet, where plasmoids appear, and a bi-directional jet forms. This is
consistent with what is expected for UV bursts or explosive events, and we
provide a self-consistent model of the formation of the reconnection region in
such events. The gravitational stratification gives an explanation for why
explosive events are restricted to a temperature range around a few 0.1 MK, and
the presence of plasmoids in the reconnection process provides an understanding
of the observed variability during the transient events on a timescale of
minutes. Our numerical experiments provide a comprehensive understanding of UV
bursts and explosive events, in particular of how the atmospheric response
changes if the reconnection happens at different plasma-beta, that is, at
different heights in the atmosphere. This analysis also gives new insight into
how UV bursts might be related to the photospheric Ellerman bombs.

Title:The diversity of the circumgalactic medium around z = 0 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the Auriga simulations,"
Abstract:  Galaxies are surrounded by massive gas reservoirs (i.e. the circumgalactic
medium; CGM) which play a key role in their evolution. The properties of the
CGM, which are dependent on a variety of internal and environmental factors,
are often inferred from absorption line surveys which rely on a limited number
of single lines-of-sight. In this work we present an analysis of 28 galaxy
haloes selected from the Auriga project, a cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical
zoom-in simulation suite of isolated Milky Way-mass galaxies, to understand the
impact of CGM diversity on observational studies. Although the Auriga haloes
are selected to populate a narrow range in halo mass, our work demonstrates
that the CGM of L* galaxies is extremely diverse: column densities of commonly
observed species span ~3-4 dex and their covering fractions range from ~5 to 90
per cent. Despite this diversity, we identify the following correlations: 1)
the covering fractions (CF) of hydrogen and metals of the Auriga haloes
positively correlate with stellar mass, 2) the CF of H I, C IV, and Si II
anticorrelate with active galactic nucleus luminosity due to ionization
effects, and 3) the CF of H I, C IV, and Si II positively correlate with galaxy
disc fraction due to outflows populating the CGM with cool and dense gas. The
Auriga sample demonstrates striking diversity within the CGM of L* galaxies,
which poses a challenge for observations reconstructing CGM characteristics
from limited samples, and also indicates that long-term merger assembly history
and recent star formation are not the dominant sculptors of the CGM.

Title:Stellar Mass Growth of Brightest Cluster Galaxy Progenitors in COSMOS Since z ~ 3,"
Abstract:  We examine the role of environment on the in situ star formation (SF) hosted
by the progenitors of the most massive galaxies in the present-day universe,
the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), from $z \sim 3$ to present in the COSMOS
field. Progenitors are selected from the COSMOS field using a stellar mass cut
motivated by the evolving cumulative comoving number density of progenitors
within the Illustris simulation, as well as the Millennium-II simulation and a
constant comoving number density method for comparison. We characterize each
progenitor using far-ultraviolet--far-infrared observations taken from the
COSMOS field and fitting stellar, dust, and active galactic nucleus components
to their spectral energy distributions. Additionally, we compare the SF rates
of our progenitor sample to the local density maps of the COSMOS field to
identify the effects of environment. We find that BCG progenitors evolve in
three stages, starting with an in situ SF dominated phase ($z > 2.25$). This is
followed by a phase until $z \sim 1.25$ where mass growth is driven by in situ
SF and stellar mass deposited by mergers (both gas rich and poor) on the same
order of magnitude independent of local environment. Finally, at low redshift
dry mergers are the dominant stellar mass generation process. We also identify
this final transition period as the time when progenitors quench, exhibiting
quiescent NUV\emph{rJ} colors.

Bulge using the VVV Survey near-IR data. We have discovered a total sample of
$N=630$ events within an area covering $20.68 deg^2$ between the years 2010 and
2015. In this paper we describe the search and present the data for the final

standard microlensing parameters. We use the near-IR Color-Magnitude and
Color-Color Diagram to select $N_{RC}=290$ events with red-clump sources to
analyze the extinction properties of the sample in the central region of the
Galactic plane. The timescale distribution and its dependence in the longitude
axis is presented. The mean timescale decreases as we approach the Galactic
minor axis ($b=0$ deg). Finally, we give examples of special microlensing

Title:The 21cm bispectrum during reionization: a tracer of the ionization topology,"
Abstract:  We compute the bispectra of the 21cm signal during the Epoch of Reionization
for three different reionization scenarios that are based on a dark matter
N-body simulation combined with a self-consistent, semi-numerical model of
galaxy evolution and reionization. Our reionization scenarios differ in their
trends of ionizing escape fractions ($f_\mathrm{esc}$) with the underlying
galaxy properties and cover the physically plausible range, i.e.
$f_\mathrm{esc}$ effectively decreasing, being constant, or increasing with
halo mass. We find the 21cm bispectrum to be sensitive to the resulting
ionization topologies that significantly differ in their size distribution of
ionized and neutral regions throughout reionization. From squeezed to stretched
triangles, the 21cm bispectra features a change of sign from negative to
positive values, with ionized and neutral regions representing below-average
and above-average concentrations contributing negatively and positively,
respectively. The position of the change of sign provides a tracer of the size
distribution of the ionized and neutral regions, and allows us to identify
three major regimes that the 21cm bispectrum undergoes during reionization. In
particular the regime during the early stages of reionization, where the 21cm
bispectrum tracks the peak of the size distribution of the ionized regions,
provides exciting prospects for pinning down reionization with the forthcoming
Square Kilometre Array.

Title:Spinning up planetary bodies by pebble accretion,"
Abstract:  Most major planetary bodies in the solar system rotate in the same direction
as their orbital motion: their spin is prograde. Theoretical studies to explain
the direction as well as the magnitude of the spin vector have had mixed
success. When the accreting building blocks are $\sim$ km-size planetesimals --
as predicted by the classical model -- the accretion process is so symmetric
that it cancels out prograde with retrograde spin contributions, rendering the
net spin minute. For this reason, the currently-favored model for the origin of
planetary rotation is the giant impact model, in which a single collision
suffices to deliver a spin, which magnitude is close to the breakup rotation
rate. However, the giant impact model does not naturally explain the preference
for prograde spin. Similarly, an increasing number of spin-vector measurement
of asteroids also shows that the spin vector of large (primordial) asteroids is
not isotropic. Here, we re-assess the viability of smaller particles to bestow
planetary bodies with a net spin, focusing on the pebble accretion model in
which gas drag and gravity join forces to accrete small particles at a large
cross section. Similar to the classical calculation for planetesimals, we
integrate the pebble equation of motion and measure the angular momentum
transfer at impact. We consider a variety of disk conditions and pebble
properties and conduct our calculations in the limits of 2D (planar) and 3D
(homogeneous) pebble distributions. We find that in certain regions of the
parameter space the angular momentum transfer is significant, much larger than
with planetesimals and on par with or exceeding the current spin of planetary
bodies.

Abstract:  21 cm intensity mapping has arisen as a powerful probe of the high-redshift

solve both problems. From the combination of an intensity map with an
overlapping galaxy survey we construct a new one-point statistic which is
unbiased by foregrounds and contains information left out of conventional

unprecedented precision using observations similar to recent 21 cm detections.

Title:ALMA Spectral Imaging of Titan Contemporaneous with Cassini's Grand Finale,"
Abstract:  The Cassini mission performed 127 targeted flybys of Titan during its 13-year
mission to Saturn, culminating in the Grand Finale between April-September
2017. Here we demonstrate the use of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) to continue Cassini's legacy for chemical and climatological
studies of Titan's atmosphere. Whole-hemisphere, interferometric spectral maps
of HCN, HNC, HC3N, CH3CN, C2H3CN, C2H5CN and C3H8 were obtained using ALMA in
May 2017 at moderate (~0.2'', or 1300 km) spatial resolution, revealing the
effects of seasonally-variable chemistry and dynamics on the distribution of
each species. The ALMA sub-mm observations of HCN and HC3N are consistent with
Cassini infrared data on these species, obtained in the same month.
Chemical/dynamical lifetimes of a few years are inferred for C2H3CN and C2H5CN,
in reasonably close agreement with the latest chemical models incorporating
sticking of C2H5CN to stratospheric aerosol particles. ALMA radial limb flux
profiles provide column density information as a function of altitude,
revealing maximum abundances in the thermosphere (above 600 km) for HCN, HNC,
HC3N and C2H5CN. This constitutes the first detailed measurement of the spatial
distribution of HNC, which is found to be confined predominantly to altitudes
above 730 $\pm$ 60 km. The HNC emission map shows an east-west hemispheric
asymmetry of (13$\pm$3)%. These results are consistent with very rapid
production (and loss) of HNC in Titan's uppermost atmosphere, making this
molecule an effective probe of short-timescale (diurnal) ionospheric processes.

Title:Using Muon Rings for the Calibration of the Cherenkov Telescope Array: A Systematic Review of the Method and its Potential Accuracy,"
Abstract:  The analysis of ring images produced by muons in an Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) provides a powerful and precise method to calibrate
the IACT optical throughput and monitor its optical point-spread function
(PSF). First proposed by the Whipple collaboration in the early 90's, this
method has been refined by the so-called second generation of IACT experiments:
H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS. We review here the progress made with these
instruments and investigate the applicability of the method as the primary
throughput calibration method for the different telescope types forming the
future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). We find several additional systematic
effects not yet taken into account by previous authors and propose several new
analytical methods to include these in the analysis. Slight modifications in
hardware and analysis need to be made to ensure that such a calibration works
as accurately as required for the CTA. We derive analytic estimates for the
expected muon data rates for optical throughput calibration, camera pixel
flat-fielding and monitoring of the optical PSF. The achievable statistical and
systematic uncertainties of the method are also assessed.

Title:A spectrophotometric study of planetary nebulae and HII regions in the M83 galaxy,"
Abstract:  Low and intermediate mass stars (0.8-8M$\odot$) in the end of their evolution
pass through a series of events of mass loss, which contributes for the
enrichment of the interstellar medium. The end of this evolutionary process is
preceded by the planetary nebulae (PNe) phase, representing an important source
of information for understanding the chemical enrichment of galaxies. The M83
barred galaxy is a relatively nearby galaxy, which allows the
spectrophotometric study of its photoionized objects. In the literature, HII
regions have been extensively explored in this galaxy, though its PNe
population has not previously been addressed. In this work we report, for the
first time, a spectrophotometric study of the PNe population in the M83 galaxy.
The data was observed with the Gemini GMOS multi-object spectrograph in 2014

condition (< 0.8 arcsec). These data are curently being reduced with the Gemini
Pyraf package. In the first phase of this project we wish to confirm
spectroscopically the PNe candidates of the sample to further analyze, for the
first time, the radial gradient of chemical abundances from the PNe population

Title:SDSS-IV MaNGA: Effects of Morphology in the global and local Star Formation Main Sequences,"
Abstract:  We study the global star-formation rate (SFR) vs. stellar mass (M$_*$)
correlation, and the spatially-resolved SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$)
vs. stellar mass surface density (\Sm) correlation, in a sample of $\sim2,000$
galaxies from the MaNGA MPL-5 survey. We classify galaxies and
spatially-resolved areas into star-forming and retired according to their
ionization processes. We confirm the existence of a Star-Forming Main Sequence
(SFMS) for galaxies and spatially-resolved areas, and show that they have the
same nature, with the global as a consequence of the local one. The latter
presents a bend below a limit \Sm value, $\approx 3\times 10^7$
M$_\odot$kpc$^{-2}$, which is not physical. Using only star-forming areas
(SFAs) above this limit, a slope and a scatter of $\approx1$ and $\approx0.27$
dex are determined. The retired galaxies/areas strongly segregate from their
respective SFMS's, by $\sim -1.5$ dex on average. We explore how the
global/local SFMS's depend on galaxy morphology, finding that for star-forming
galaxies and SFAs, there is a trend to lower values of star-formation activity
with earlier morphological types, which is more pronounced for the local SFMS.
The morphology not only affects the global SFR due to the diminish of SFAs with
earlier types, but also affects the local SF process. Our results suggest that
the local SF at all radii is established by some universal mechanism partially
modulated by morphology. Morphology seems to be connected to the slow aging and
sharp decline of the SF process, and on its own it may depend on other
properties as the environment.

Title:Adaptive elliptical aperture photometry: a software package for high-cadence ground-based photometry. I. Application to rapid oscillators observed from SAAO,"
Abstract:  Context. Modern space telescopes are currently providing high-precision light
curves for a large fraction of the sky, such that many new variable stars are
being discovered. However, some stars have periodic variability with periods of
order minutes and require high-cadence photometry to probe the physical
mechanisms responsible. A cadence of less than a minute is often required to
remove Nyquist ambiguities and confirm rapid variability which forces observers
to obtain high-cadence ground-based photometry. Aims. We aim to provide a
modern software package to reduce ground-based photometric time series data and
deliver optimised (differential) light curves. To produce high-quality light
curves, which maximise the amplitude signal-to-noise ratio of short-period
variability in a Fourier spectrum, we require adaptive elliptical aperture
photometry as this represents a significant advantage compared to aperture
photometry using circular apertures of fixed radii. Methods. The methodology of
our code and its advantages are demonstrated using high-cadence ground-based
photometry from the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) of a
confirmed rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star. Furthermore, we employ our
software package to search for rapid oscillations in three candidate roAp
stars. Results. We demonstrate that our pipeline represents a significant
improvement in the quality of light curves, and we make it available to the
community for use with different instruments and observatories. We search for
and demonstrate the lack of high-frequency roAp pulsations to a limit of
$\sim$1 mmag using B data in the three Ap stars HD 158596, HD 166542 and HD
181810. Conclusions. We demonstrate the significant improvement in the
extraction of short-period variability caused by high-frequency pulsation
modes, and discuss the implication of null detections in three Ap stars.

Title:SETI in the Spatio-Temporal Survey Domain,"
Abstract:  Traditional searches for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) or
""technosignatures"" focus on dedicated observations of single stars or regions
in the sky to detect excess or transient emission from intelligent sources. The
newest generation of synoptic time domain surveys enable an entirely new
approach: spatio-temporal SETI, where technosignatures may be discovered from
spatially resolved sources or multiple stars over time. Current optical time
domain surveys such as ZTF and the Evryscope can probe 10-100 times more of the
""Cosmic Haystack"" parameter space volume than many radio SETI investigations.
Small-aperture, high cadence surveys like Evryscope can be comparable in their
Haystack volume completeness to deeper surveys including LSST. Investigations
with these surveys can also be conducted at a fraction of the cost of dedicated
SETI surveys, since they make use of data already being gathered. However, SETI
methodology has not widely utilized such surveys, and the field is in need of
new search algorithms that can account for signals in both the spatial and
temporal domains. Here I describe the broad potential for modern wide-field
time domain optical surveys to revolutionize our search for technosignatures,
and illustrate some example SETI approaches using transiting exoplanets to form
a distributed beacon.

KOI-1783.01, and Kepler-177c, obtained using the Wide-field Infrared Camera on
the Hale 200"" telescope at Palomar Observatory. By utilizing an engineered
diffuser and custom guiding software, we mitigate time-correlated telluric and
instrumental noise sources in these observations. We achieve an infrared
photometric precision comparable to or better than that of space-based
observatories such as the \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}, and detect transits
with greater than 3$\sigma$ significance for all planets. For Kepler-177c
($J=13.9$) our measurement uncertainties are only $1.2\times$ the photon noise
limit and 1.9 times better than the predicted photometric precision for
\textit{Spitzer} IRAC photometry of this same target. We find that a single
transit observation obtained $4-5$ years after the end of the original
\textit{Kepler} mission can reduce dynamical mass uncertainties by as much as a
factor of three for these systems. Additionally, we combine our new
observations of KOI-1783.01 with information from the literature to confirm the
planetary nature of this system. We discuss the implications of our new mass
and radius constraints in the context of known exoplanets with low incident
fluxes, and we note that Kepler-177c may be a more massive analog to the
currently known super-puffs given its core mass (3.8$\pm0.9M_\Earth$) and large
gas-to-core ratio (2.8$\pm0.7$). Our demonstrated infrared photometric
performance opens up new avenues for ground-based observations of transiting

Title:Shear measurement bias due to spatially varying spectral energy distributions in galaxies,"
Abstract:  Galaxy color gradients - i.e., spectral energy distributions that vary across

uniform color. This paper describes the techniques and results of a study of
the expected impact of galaxy color gradients on weak lensing measurements with
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) when the PSF size depends on
wavelength. The bias on cosmic shear measurements from color gradients is
computed both for parametric bulge+disk galaxy simulations and for more
realistic chromatic galaxy surface brightness profiles based on HST V- and
I-band images in the AEGIS survey. For the parametric galaxies, and for the
more realistic galaxies derived from AEGIS galaxies with sufficient SNR that
color gradient bias can be isolated, the predicted multiplicative shear biases
due to color gradients are found to be at least a factor of 2 below the LSST
full-depth requirement on the total systematic uncertainty in the
redshift-dependent shear calibration. The analysis code and data products are

Title:Decaying turbulence and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters,"
Abstract:  We explore the decay of turbulence and magnetic fields generated by
fluctuation dynamo action in the context of galaxy clusters where such a
decaying phase can occur in the aftermath of a major merger event. Using
idealized numerical simulations that start from a kinetically dominated regime
we focus on the decay of the steady state rms velocity and the magnetic field
for a wide range of conditions that include varying the compressibility of the
flow, the forcing wave number, and the magnetic Prandtl number. Irrespective of
the compressibility of the flow, both the rms velocity and the rms magnetic
field decay as a power-law in time. In the subsonic case we find that the
exponent of the power-law is consistent with the $-3/5$ scaling reported in
previous studies. However, in the transonic regime both the rms velocity and
the magnetic field initially undergo rapid decay with an $\approx t^{-1.1}$
scaling with time. This is followed by a phase of slow decay where the decay of
the rms velocity exhibits an $\approx -3/5$ scaling in time, while the rms
magnetic field scales as $\approx -5/7$. Furthermore, analysis of the Faraday
rotation measure reveals that the Faraday RM decays also decays as a power law
in time $\approx t^{-5/7}$; steeper than the $\sim t^{-2/5}$ scaling obtained
in previous simulations of magnetic field decay in subsonic turbulence. Apart
from galaxy clusters, our work can have potential implications in the study of
magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies.

Abstract:  Galaxy interaction is considered a key driver of galaxy evolution and star
formation (SF) history. In this paper, we present an empirical picture of the
radial extent of interaction-triggered SF along the merger sequence. The
samples under study are drawn from the integral field spectroscopy (IFS) survey
SDSS-IV MaNGA, including 205 star-forming galaxies in pairs/mergers and ~1350
control galaxies. For each galaxy in pairs, the merger stage is identified
according to its morphological signatures: incoming phase, at first pericenter
passage, at apocenter, in merging phase, and in final coalescence. The effect
of interactions is quantified by the global and spatially resolved SF rate
relative to the SF rate of a control sample selected for each individual galaxy
($\Delta$logSFR and $\Delta$logsSFR(r), respectively). Analysis of the radial
$\Delta$logsSFR(r) distributions shows that galaxy interactions have no
significant impact on the $\Delta$logsSFR(r) during the incoming phase. Right
after the first pericenter passage, the radial $\Delta$logsSFR(r) profile
decreases steeply from enhanced to suppressed activity for increasing
galactocentric radius. Later on, SF is enhanced on a broad spatial scale out to
the maximum radius we explore (~6.7 kpc) and the enhancement is in general
centrally peaked. The extended SF enhancement is also observed for systems at
their apocenters and in the coalescence phase, suggesting that
interaction-triggered SF is not restricted to the central region of a galaxy.
Further explorations of a wide range in parameter space of merger
configurations (e.g., mass ratio) are required to constrain the whole picture
of interaction-triggered SF.

Title:Direct detection of the cosmic expansion: the redshift drift and the flux drift,"
Abstract:  The redshift drift, the change of cosmological redshift with time, is a
direct consequence of the expansion of the Universe. Thus the measurement of
the cosmological redshift drift will offer a direct test of our models of
cosmology. The magnitude of the effect is very small, i.e. the spectral shift
is of order of $10^{-10} - 10^{-9}$ over the period of a decade, but the next
generation facilities such as ELT and SKA will be able to directly detect the
expansion of our Universe by the year 2040. In this paper we focus on
detectebility of this effect, including strategies of overcoming the kinematic
contamination of the cosmological signal. We also show that the redshift drift
directly impacts the change of flux. Thus apart from the redshift drift,
measurements of the flux drift will provide an additional tool of detecting the
expansion of the universe, including its acceleration. We discuss the
strategies of detecting the flux drift and show that by including the flux
drift signal to the redshift drift signal we boost the chances of a direct
detection of the expansion of the Universe. We show that if only the stability
of flux is at the level of $\Delta F/F \sim 10^{-6}$ then the SKA1-mid Array
should be able to detect these effects, before the ETL and the full SKA. Thus,
by including the flux drift into the SKA1-mid Array's analysis pipeline, we
could be able to provide by mid-2030s a direct evidence of the expansion of the
universe including its accelerating phase.

Title:Halo Acceleration Relation,"
Abstract:  Recently, from the new Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves
(SPARC) data, McGaugh et al. (2016) reported a tight Radial Acceleration
Relation (RAR) between the observed total acceleration and the acceleration
produced by baryons in spiral galaxies. The relation can be fitted by different
functions. However, these functions can be discerned if we express the data in
the form of halo acceleration relation (HAR). The data reveals a maximum in the
halo acceleration. We examined NFW (cusp) and Burkert (core) profiles in the
context of dark matter and different parameter families of the interpolating
function in the framework of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND).

Title:Two Types of Solar Confined Flares,"
Abstract:  With the aim of understanding the physical mechanisms of confined flares, we
selected 18 confined flares during 2011-2017, and classified the confined
flares into two types based on their different dynamic properties and magnetic
configurations. ""Type I"" of confined flares are characterized by slipping
reconnection, strong shear, and stable filament. ""Type II"" flares have nearly
no slipping reconnection, and have a configuration in potential state after the
flare. Filament erupts but is confined by strong strapping field. ""Type II""
flares could be explained by 2D MHD models while ""type I"" flares need 3D MHD
models. 7 flares of 18 ($\sim$39 \%) belong to ""type I"" and 11 ($\sim$61 \%)
are ""type II"" confined flares. The post-flare loops (PFLs) of ""type I"" flares
have a stronger non-potentiality, however, the PFLs in ""type II"" flares are
weakly sheared. All the ""type I"" flares exhibit the ribbon elongations parallel
to the polarity inversion line (PIL) at speeds of several tens of km s$^{-1}$.
For ""type II"" flares, only a small proportion shows the ribbon elongations
along the PIL. We suggest that different magnetic topologies and reconnection
scenarios dictate the distinct properties for the two types of flares. Slipping
agnetic reconnections between multiple magnetic systems result in ""type I""
flares. For ""type II"" flares, magnetic reconnections occur in anti-parallel
magnetic fields underlying the erupting filament. Our study shows that ""type I""
flares account for more than one third of the overall large confined flares,
which should not be neglected in further studies.

Title:The Genesis of Magnetic Fields in White Dwarfs,"
Abstract:  Magnetic fields generated by a dynamo mechanism due to differential rotation
during stellar mergers are often proposed as an explanation for the presence of
strong fields in certain classes of magnetic stars, including high field
magnetic white dwarfs (HFMWDs). In the case of the HFMWDs, the site of the
differential rotation has been variously proposed to be the common envelope
itself, the massive hot outer regions of a merged degenerate core or an
accretion disc formed by a tidally disrupted companion that is subsequently
incorporated into a degenerate core.
In the present study I explore the possibility that the origin of HFMWDs is
consistent with stellar interactions during the common envelope evolution
(CEE). In this picture the observed fields are caused by an $\alpha-\Omega$
dynamo driven by differential rotation. The strongest fields would arise when
the differential rotation equals the critical break up velocity and would occur
from the merging of two stars during CEE or double degenerate (DD) mergers in a
post common envelope (CE) stage. Those systems that do not coalesce but emerge
from the CE on a close orbit and about to initiate mass transfer will evolve
into magnetic cataclysmic variables (MCVs),
The population synthesis calculations carried out in this work have shown
that the origin of high fields in isolated white dwarfs (WDs) and in WDs in
MCVs is consistent with stellar interaction during common envelope evolution. I
compare the calculated field strengths to those observed and test the
correlation between theory and observation by means of the Kolmogorov--Smirnov
(K--S) test and show that the resulting correlation is good for values of the
CE energy efficiency parameter, $\alpha{_{\rm{CE}}}$, in the range 0.1--0.3.

Title:Thermophysical modeling of NEOWISE observations of DESTINY+ targets Phaethon and 2005 UD,"
Abstract:  Thermophysical models allow for improved constraints on the physical and
thermal surface properties of asteroids beyond what can be inferred from more
simple thermal modeling, provided a sufficient number of observations is
available. We present thermophysical modeling results of observations from the
NEOWISE mission for two near-Earth asteroids which are the targets of the
DESTINY+ flyby mission: (3200) Phaethon and (155140) 2005 UD. Our model assumes
a rotating, cratered, spherical surface, and employs a Monte Carlo Markov Chain
to explore the multi-dimensional parameter space of the fit. We find an
effective spherical diameter for Phaethon of $4.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}~$km, a
geometric albedo of $p_V=0.16\pm0.02$, and a thermal inertia $\Gamma=880$
$^{+580}_{-330}$, using five epochs of NEOWISE observations. The best model fit
for (155140) 2005 UD was less well constrained due to only having two NEOWISE
observation epochs, giving a diameter of $1.2\pm0.4~$km and a geometric albedo
of $p_V=0.14\pm0.09$.

Title:Radiative-equilibrium model of Jupiter's atmosphere and application to estimating stratospheric circulations,"
Abstract:  We present a computationally efficient 1-D seasonal radiative model, with
convective adjustment, of Jupiter's atmosphere. Our model takes into account
radiative forcings from the main hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, acetylene),
ammonia, collision-induced absorption, four cloud and haze layers (including a
UV-absorbing ""polar"" stratospheric haze) and an internal heat flux. We detail
sensitivity studies of the equilibrium temperature profile to several
parameters. We discuss the expected seasonal, vertical and meridional thermal
structure and compare it to that derived from Cassini and ground-based thermal
infrared observations. We find that the equilibrium temperature in the 5-30
mbar pressure range is very sensitive to the chosen stratospheric haze optical
properties, sizes and number of monomers. The polar haze can significantly warm
the lower stratosphere (10-30 mbar) by up to 20K at latitudes 45-60. At
pressures lower than 3 mbar, our modeled temperatures systematically
underestimate the observed ones by 5K. This might suggest that other processes,
such as dynamical heating by wave breaking or by eddies, or a coupling with
thermospheric circulation, play an important role. In the troposphere, we can
only match the observed lack of meridional gradient of temperature by varying
the internal heat flux with latitude. We then exploit knowledge of heating and
cooling rates to diagnose the residual-mean circulation in Jupiter's
stratosphere, under the assumption that the eddy heat flux convergence term is
negligible. In the lower stratosphere (5-30 mbar), the residual-mean
circulation strongly depends on the assumed properties of the stratospheric
haze. Our main conclusion is that it is crucial to improve our knowledge on the
radiative forcing terms to increase our confidence in the estimated
circulation. By extension, this will also be crucial for future 3D GCM studies.

Title:Prospects for the Use of Photosensor Timing Information with Machine Learning Techniques in Background Rejection,"
Abstract:  Recent developments in machine learning (ML) techniques present a promising
new analysis method for high-speed imaging in astroparticle physics
experiments, for example with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs).
In particular, the use of timing information with new machine learning
techniques provides a novel method for event classification. Previous work in
this field has utilised images of the integrated charge from IACT camera
photomultipliers, but the majority of current and upcoming IACT cameras have
the capacity to read out the entire photosensor waveform following a trigger.
As the arrival times of Cherenkov photons from extensive air showers (EAS) at
the camera plane are dependent upon the altitude of their emission, these
waveforms contain information useful for IACT event classification. In this
work, we investigate the potential for using these waveforms with ML
techniques, and find that a highly effective means of utilising their
information is to create a set of seven additional two dimensional histograms
of waveform parameters to be fed into the machine learning algorithm along with
the integrated charge image. This appears to be superior to using only these
new ML techniques with the waveform integrated charge alone. We also examine
these timing-based ML techniques in the context of other experiments.

Title:Magnetic activity of the solar-like star HD 140538,"
Abstract:  The periods of rotation and activity cycles are among the most important
properties of the magnetic dynamo thought to be operating in late-type,
main-sequence stars. In this paper, we present a S$_{\rm{MWO}}$-index time
series composed from different data sources for the solar-like star HD 140538
and derive a period of 3.88$\pm$0.02 yr for its activity cycle. Furthermore, we
analyse the high-cadence, seasonal S$_{\rm{MWO}}$ data taken with the TIGRE
telescope and find a rotational period of 20.71$\pm$0.32 days. In addition, we
estimate the stellar age of HD 140538 as 3.7 Gyrs via a matching evolutionary
track. This is slightly older than the ages obtained from gyrochronology based
on the above rotation period, as well as the activity-age relation. These
results, together with its stellar parameters that are very similar to a
younger Sun, make HD 140538 a relevant case study for our understanding of
solar activity and its evolution with time.

Title:Non-LTE radiation hydrodynamics in PLUTO,"
Abstract:  Modeling the dynamics of most astrophysical structures requires an adequate
description of the radiation-matter interaction. Several numerical
(magneto)hydrodynamics codes were upgraded with a radiation module to fulfill
this request. However, those among them that use either the flux-limited
diffusion (FLD) or the M1 radiation moment approaches are restricted to the
local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). This assumption may be not valid in some
astrophysical cases. We present an upgraded version of the LTE
radiation-hydrodynamics module implemented in the PLUTO code, originally
developed by Kolb et al. (2013), which we have extended to handle non-LTE
regimes. Starting from the general frequency-integrated comoving-frame
equations of radiation hydrodynamics (RHD), we have justified all the
assumptions made to obtain the non-LTE equations actually implemented in the
module, under the FLD approximation. An operator-split method is employed, with
two substeps: the hydrodynamic part is solved with an explicit method by the
solvers already available in PLUTO, the non-LTE radiation diffusion and energy
exchange part is solved with an implicit method. The module is implemented in
the PLUTO environment. It uses databases of radiative quantities that can be
provided independently by the user: the radiative power loss, the Planck and
Rosseland mean opacities. Our implementation has been validated through
different tests, in particular radiative shock tests. The agreement with the
semi-analytical solutions (when available) is good, with a maximum error of 7%.
Moreover, we have proved that non-LTE approach is of paramount importance to
properly model accretion shock structures. Our radiation FLD module represents
a step toward the general non-LTE RHD modeling. The module is available, under
request, for the community.

Title:Prevalent externally-driven protoplanetary disc dispersal as a function of the galactic environment,"
Abstract:  The stellar birth environment can significantly shorten protoplanetary disc
(PPD) lifetimes due to the influence of stellar feedback mechanisms. The degree
to which these mechanisms suppress the time and mass available for planet
formation is dependent on the local far-ultraviolet (FUV) field strength,
stellar density, and ISM properties. In this work, we present the first
theoretical framework quantifying the distribution of PPD dispersal time-scales
as a function of parameters that describe the galactic environment. We
calculate the probability density function for FUV flux and stellar density in
the solar neighbourhood. In agreement with previous studies, we find that
external photoevaporation is the dominant environment-related factor
influencing local stellar populations after the embedded phase. Applying our
general prescription to the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way (i.e. the
central ~250 pc), we predict that 90% of PPDs in the region are destroyed
within 1 Myr of the dispersal of the parent molecular cloud. Even in such dense
environments, we find that external photoevaporation is the dominant disc
depletion mechanism over dynamical encounters between stars. PPDs around
low-mass stars are particularly sensitive to FUV-induced mass loss, due to a
shallower gravitational potential. For stars of mass ~1 $M_\odot$, the solar
neighbourhood lies at approximately the highest gas surface density for which
PPD dispersal is still relatively unaffected by external FUV photons, with a
median PPD dispersal timescale of ~4 Myr. We highlight the key questions to be
addressed to further contextualise the significance of the local galactic
environment for planet formation.

"Title:Formation of rocky and icy planetesimals inside and outside the snow line: Effects of diffusion, sublimation and back-reaction","
Abstract:  It is important to clarify where and when rocky and icy planetesimals are
formed in a viscously evolving disk. We wish to understand how local runaway
pile-up of solids occurs inside or outside the snow line. We assume an icy
pebble contains micron-sized silicate grains that are uniformly mixed with ice
and are released during the ice sublimation. Using a local one-dimensional
code, we solve the radial drift and the turbulent diffusion of solids and the
water vapor, taking account of their sublimation/condensation around the snow
line. We systematically investigate effects of back-reactions of the solids to
gas on the radial drift and diffusion of solids, scale height evolution of the
released silicate particles, and possible difference in effective viscous
parameters between that for turbulent diffusion ($\alpha_{\rm tur}$) and that
for the gas accretion rate onto the central star ($\alpha_{\rm acc}$). We study
the dependence on the ratio of the solid mass flux to the gas ($F_{\rm p/g}$).
We show that the favorable locations for the pile-up of silicate grains and icy
pebbles are the regions in the proximity of the water snow line inside and
outside it, respectively. We found that runaway pile-ups occur when both the
back-reactions for radial drift and diffusion are included. In the case with
only the back-reaction for the radial drift, no runaway pile-up is found except
for extremely high pebble flux, while the condition of streaming instability
can be satisfied for relatively large $F_{\rm p/g}$ as found in the past
literatures. If the back-reactions for radial diffusion is considered, the
runaway pile-up occurs for reasonable value of pebble flux. The runaway pile-up
of silicate grains that would lead to formation of rocky planetesimals occurs
for $\alpha_{\rm tur} \ll \alpha_{\rm acc}$, while the runaway pile-up of icy
pebbles is favored for $\alpha_{\rm tur} \sim \alpha_{\rm acc}$.

Title:Oxygen abundance and the N/C vs N/O relation for AFG supergiants and bright giants,"
Abstract:  Non-LTE analysis (LTE is local thermodynamic equilibrium) of the oxygen
abundances for 51 Galactic A-, F- and G-type supergiants and bright giants is
performed. In contrast with carbon and nitrogen, oxygen does not show any
significant systematic anomalies in their abundances log E(O). There is no
marked difference from the initial oxygen abundance within errors of the log
E(O) determination across the Teff interval from 4500 to 8500 K and the log g
interval from 1.2 to 2.9 dex. This result agrees well with theoretical
predictions for stellar models with rotation. With our new data for oxygen and
our earlier non-LTE determinations of the N and C abundances for stars from the
same sample, we constructed the [N/C] vs [N/O] relation for 17 stars. This
relation is known to be a sensitive indicator of stellar evolution. A
pronounced correlation between [N/C] vs [N/O] is found; the observed [N/C]
increase from 0 to 1.6 dex is accompanied by the [N/O] increase from 0 to 0.9
dex. When comparing the observed [N/C] vs [N/O] relation with the theoretical
one, we show that this relation reflects a strong dependence of the
evolutionary changes in CNO abundances on the initial rotation velocities of
stars. Given that the initial rotational velocities of these stars are expected
to satisfy V0<150 km/s, it is found that they are mostly the post first
dredge-up (post-FDU) objects. It is important that just such initial velocities
V0 are typical for about 80% of stars in question (i.e. for stars with masses
4-19 M_sun). A constancy of the total C+N+O abundance during stellar evolution
is confirmed. The mean value log E(C+N+O)=8.97+/-0.08 found for AFG supergiants
and bright giants seems to be very close to the initial value 8.92 (the Sun) or
8.94 (the unevolved B-type MS stars).

Title:Comparison of the optical light curves of hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor type II supernovae,"
Abstract:  Type II supernovae (SNe II) show strong hydrogen features in their spectra
throughout their whole evolution while type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) spectra
evolve from dominant hydrogen lines at early times to increasingly strong
helium features later on. However, it is currently unclear whether the
progenitors of these supernova (SN) types form a continuum in pre-SN hydrogen
mass or whether they are physically distinct. SN light-curve morphology
directly relates to progenitor and explosion properties such as the amount of
hydrogen in the envelope, the pre-SN radius, the explosion energy and the
synthesized mass of radioactive material. In this work we study the morphology
of the optical-wavelength light curves of hydrogen-rich SNe II and
hydrogen-poor SNe IIb to test whether an observational continuum exists between
the two. Using a sample of 95 SNe (73 SNe II and 22 SNe IIb), we define a range
of key observational parameters and present a comparative analysis between both
types. We find a lack of events that bridge the observed properties of SNe II
and SNe IIb. Light curve parameters such as rise times and post-maximum decline
rates and curvatures clearly separate both SN types and we therefore conclude
that there is no continuum, with the two SN types forming two observationally
distinct families. In the V-band a rise time of 17 days (SNe II lower, SNe IIb
higher), and a magnitude difference between 30 and 40 days post explosion of
0.4 mag (SNe II lower, SNe IIb higher) serve as approximate thresholds to
differentiate both types.

Both gravitational and electromagnetic waves from a single astrophysical source

unprecedented opportunity to place constraints on the neutron star matter
equation of state. The existence of a possible hadron-quark phase transition in
the central regions of neutron stars is associated with the appearance of
g-modes, which are extremely important as they could signal the presence of a
pure quark matter core in the centers of neutron stars. Observations of g-modes
with frequencies between 1 kHz and 1.5 kHz could be interpreted as evidence of
a sharp hadron-quark phase transition in the cores of neutron stars. In this
article, we shall review the description of the dense matter composing neutron
stars, the determination of the equation of state of such matter, and the
constraints imposed by astrophysical observations of these fascinating compact
objects.

Title:Avocado: Photometric Classification of Astronomical Transients with Gaussian Process Augmentation,"
Abstract:  Upcoming astronomical surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST) will rely on photometric classification to identify the majority of the
transients and variables that they discover. We present a set of techniques for
photometric classification that can be applied even when the training set of
spectroscopically-confirmed objects is heavily biased towards bright,
low-redshift objects. Using Gaussian process regression to model arbitrary
light curves in all bands simultaneously, we ""augment"" the training set by
generating new versions of the original light curves covering a range of
redshifts and observing conditions. We train a boosted decision tree classifier
on features extracted from the augmented light curves, and we show how such a
classifier can be designed to produce classifications that are independent of
the redshift distributions of objects in the training sample. Our
classification algorithm was the best-performing among the 1,094 models
considered in the blinded phase of the Photometric LSST Astronomical
Time-Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC), scoring 0.468 on the
organizers' logarithmic-loss metric with flat weights for all object classes in
the training set, and achieving an AUC of 0.957 for classification of Type Ia
supernovae. Our results suggest that spectroscopic campaigns used for training
photometric classifiers should focus on typing large numbers of well-observed,
intermediate redshift transients instead of attempting to type a sample of
transients that is directly representative of the full dataset being
classified. All of the algorithms described in this paper are implemented in
the avocado software package.

Abstract:  In 2017, the Be/X-ray transient 4U 0115+63 exhibited a new type-II outburst
that was two times fainter than its 2015 giant outburst (in the Swift/BAT count
rates). Despite this difference between the two bright events, the source
displayed similar X-ray behaviour after these periods. Once the outbursts
ceased, the source did not transit towards quiescence directly, but was
detected about a factor of 10 above its known quiescent level. It eventually
decayed back to quiescence over time scales of months. In this paper we present
the results of our Swift monitoring campaign, and an XMM-Newton observation of

low-luminosity behaviour. We discuss the possible origin of the decaying source
emission at this low-level luminosity, which has now been shown as a recurrent
phenomenon, in the framework of the two proposed scenarios to explain this
faint state: cooling from an accretion-heated neutron-star crust or continuous
low-level accretion. In addition, we compare the outcome of our study with the

Title:The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST),"
Abstract:  The sub-mm sky is a unique window for probing the architecture of the
Universe and structures within it. From the discovery of dusty sub-mm galaxies,
to the ringed nature of protostellar disks, our understanding of the formation,
destruction, and evolution of objects in the Universe requires a comprehensive
view of the sub-mm sky. The current generation single-dish sub-mm facilities
have shown of the potential for discovery, while interferometers have presented
a high resolution view into the finer details. However, our understanding of
large-scale structure and our full use of these interferometers is now hampered
by the limited sensitivity of our sub-mm view of the universe at larger scales.
Thus, now is the time to start planning the next generation of sub-mm single
dish facilities, to build on these revolutions in our understanding of the
sub-mm sky. Here we present the case for the Atacama Large Aperture
Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a concept for a 50m class single dish
telescope. We envision AtLAST as a facility operating as an international
partnership with a suite of instruments to deliver the transformative science
described in many Astro2020 science white papers. A 50m telescope with a high
throughput and 1$^\circ$ FoV with a full complement of advanced
instrumentation, including highly multiplexed high-resolution spectrometers,
continuum cameras and Integral Field Units, AtLAST will have mapping speeds
thousands of times greater than any current or planned facility. It will reach
confusion limits below $L_*$ in the distant universe and resolve low-mass
protostellar cores at the distance of the Galactic Center, providing synergies
with upcoming facilities across the spectrum. Located on the Atacama plateau,
to observe frequencies un-obtainable by other observatories, AtLAST will enable
a fundamentally new understanding of the sub-mm universe at unprecedented
depths.

Title:How cold gas continuously entrains mass and momentum from a hot wind,"
Abstract:  The existence of fast moving, cold gas ubiquitously observed in galactic
winds is theoretically puzzling, since the destruction time of cold gas is much
smaller than its acceleration time. In previous work, we showed that cold gas
can accelerate to wind speeds and grow in mass if the radiative cooling time of
mixed gas is shorter than the cloud destruction time. Here, we study this
process in much more detail, and find remarkably robust cloud acceleration and
growth in a wide variety of scenarios. Radiative cooling, rather than the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, enables self-sustaining entrainment of hot gas
onto the cloud via cooling-induced pressure gradients. Indeed, growth peaks
when the cloud is almost co-moving. The entrainment velocity is of order the
cold gas sound speed, and growth is accompanied by cloud pulsations. Growth is
also robust to the background wind and initial cloud geometry. In an adiabatic
Chevalier-Clegg type wind, for instance, the mass growth rate is constant.
Although growth rates are similar with magnetic fields, cloud morphology
changes dramatically, with low density, magnetically supported filaments which
have a small mass fraction but dominate by volume. This could bias absorption
line observations. Cloud growth from entraining and cooling hot gas can
potentially account for the cold gas content of the CGM. It can also fuel star
formation in the disk as cold gas recycled in a galactic fountain accretes and
cools halo gas. We speculate that galaxy-scale simulations should converge in
cold gas mass once cloud column densities of ${\rm N} \sim 10^{18} \ {\rm
cm^{-2}}$ are resolved.

Title:A statistically significant lack of debris discs in medium separation binary systems,"
Abstract:  We compile a sample of 341 binary and multiple star systems with the aim of
searching for and characterising Kuiper belt-like debris discs. The sample is
assembled by combining several smaller samples studied in previously published
work with targets from two unpublished Herschel surveys. We find that 38
systems show excess emission at 70 or 100 $\mu$m suggestive of a debris disc.
While nine of the discs appear to be unstable to perturbations from their host
binary based on a simple analysis of their inferred radii, we argue that the
evidence for genuine instability is not strong, primarily because of
uncertainty in the true disc radii, uncertainty in the boundaries of the
unstable regions, and orbital projection effects. The binary separation
distributions of the disc-bearing and disc-free systems are different at a
confidence level of $99.4\%$, indicating that binary separation strongly
influences the presence of detectable levels of debris. No discs are detected
for separations between $\sim$25 and 135 au; this is likely a result of
binaries whose separations are comparable with typical disc radii clearing out
their primordial circumstellar or circumbinary material via dynamical
perturbations. The disc detection rate is $19^{+5}_{-3}\%$ for binaries wider
than 135 au, similar to published results for single stars. Only
$8^{+2}_{-1}\%$ of systems with separations below 25 au host a detectable disc,
which may suggest that planetesimal formation is inhibited in binaries closer
than a few tens of au, similar to the conclusions of studies of known
planet-hosting binaries.

Title:Axion Condensate Dark Matter Constraints from Resonant Enhancement of Background Radiation,"
Abstract:  We investigate the possible parametric growth of photon amplitudes in a
background of axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter. The observed extragalactic
background radiation limits the allowed enhancement effect. We derive the
resulting constraints on the axion-photon coupling constant $g_{a\gamma}$ from
Galactic ALP condensates as well as over-densities. If ALP condensates of size
$R$ exist in our Galaxy, a scan for extremely narrow unresolved spectral lines
with frequency $\nu$ can constrain the axion-photon coupling at ALP mass
$m_a=4\pi\nu$ to $g_{a\gamma}\lesssim2\times10^{-14}(10\,{\rm kpc}/R)\,{\rm
GeV}^{-1}$. Radio to optical background data yield constraints at this level
within observed wavebands or ALP mass windows over a broad range $0.08\, \mu
\text{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 8 \text{ eV}$. These condensate constraints on
$g_{a\gamma}$ probe down to the QCD axion band for $m_a \gtrsim$ 10 $\mu$eV.

Title:Impact of Galaxy Mergers on the Colours of Cluster Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We examine the ultraviolet and optical colours of 906 cluster galaxies from
the KASI-Yonsei Deep Imaging Survey of Clusters (KYDISC). Galaxies have been
divided into two categories, morphologically-disturbed and undisturbed
galaxies, based on the visual signatures related to recent mergers. We find
that galaxies with signatures of recent mergers show significantly bluer
colours than undisturbed galaxies. Disturbed galaxies populate more on the
cluster outskirts, suggesting recent accretion into the cluster environment,
which implies that disturbed galaxies can be less influenced by the
environmental quenching process and remain blue. However, we still detect bluer
colours of disturbed galaxies in all locations (cluster core and outskirts) for
the fixed morphology, which is difficult to understand just considering the
difference in time since infall into a cluster. Moreover, blue disturbed
galaxies show features seemingly related to recent star formation. Therefore,
we suspect that mergers make disturbed galaxies keep their blue colour longer
than undisturbed galaxies under the effect of the environmental quenching
through either merger-induced star formation or central gas concentration which
is less vulnerable for gas stripping.

Title:The Tidal Disruption of Sun-like Stars by Massive Black Holes,"
Abstract:  We present the first simulations of the tidal disruption of stars with
realistic structures and compositions by massive black holes (BHs). We build
stars in the stellar evolution code MESA and simulate their disruption in the
3D adaptive-mesh hydrodynamics code FLASH, using an extended Helmholtz equation
of state and tracking 49 elements. We study the disruption of a 1$M_\odot$ star
and 3$M_\odot$ star at zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), middle-age, and
terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). The maximum BH mass for tidal disruption
increases by a factor of $\sim$2 from stellar radius changes due to MS
evolution; this is equivalent to varying BH spin from 0 to 0.75. The shape of
the mass fallback rate curves is different from the results for polytropes of
Guillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz (2013). The peak timescale $t_{\rm peak}$ increases
with stellar age, while the peak fallback rate $\dot M_{\rm peak}$ decreases
with age, and these effects diminish with increasing impact parameter $\beta$.
For a $\beta=1$ disruption of a 1$M_\odot$ star by a $10^6 M_\odot$ BH, from
ZAMS to TAMS, $t_{\rm peak}$ increases from 30 to 54 days, while $\dot M_{\rm
peak}$ decreases from 0.66 to 0.14 $M_\odot$/yr. Compositional anomalies in
nitrogen, helium, and carbon can occur before the peak timescale for
disruptions of MS stars, which is in contrast to predictions from the
""frozen-in"" model. More massive stars can show stronger anomalies at earlier
times, meaning that compositional constraints can be key in determining the
mass of the disrupted star. The abundance anomalies predicted by these
simulations provide a natural explanation for the spectral features and varying
line strengths observed in tidal disruption events.

Title:A model for the minimum mass of bound stellar clusters and its dependence on the galactic environment,"
Abstract:  We present a simple physical model for the minimum mass of bound stellar
clusters as a function of the galactic environment. The model evaluates which
parts of a hierarchically-clustered star-forming region remain bound given the
time-scales for gravitational collapse, star formation, and stellar feedback.
We predict the initial cluster mass functions (ICMFs) for a variety of galaxies
and we show that these predictions are consistent with observations of the
solar neighbourhood and nearby galaxies, including the Large Magellanic Cloud
and M31. In these galaxies, the low minimum cluster mass of
$\sim10^2~\rm{M}_{\odot}$ is caused by sampling statistics, representing the
lowest mass at which massive (feedback-generating) stars are expected to form.
At the high gas density and shear found in the Milky Way's Central Molecular
Zone and the nucleus of M82, the model predicts that a mass
$>10^2~\rm{M}_{\odot}$ must collapse into a single cluster prior to
feedback-driven dispersal, resulting in narrow ICMFs with elevated
characteristic masses. We find that the minimum cluster mass is a sensitive
probe of star formation physics due to its steep dependence on the star
formation efficiency per free-fall time. Finally, we provide predictions for
globular cluster (GC) populations, finding a narrow ICMF for dwarf galaxy
progenitors at high redshift, which can explain the high specific frequency of
GCs at low metallicities observed in Local Group dwarfs like Fornax and WLM.
The predicted ICMFs in high-redshift galaxies constitute a critical test of the
model, ideally-suited for the upcoming generation of telescopes.

Title:Possible early linear acceleration of proto-neutron stars via asymmetric neutrino emission in core-collapse supernovae,"
Abstract:  In this {\it Letter}, we present the result of an axisymmetric CCSN
simulation conducted with appropriate treatments of neutrino transport and
proper motions of proto-neutron star (PNS), in which a remarkable PNS
acceleration is observed in association with asymmetric neutrino emissions by
the time of $300$ms after bounce. We find that these asymmetric neutrino
emissions play important roles in the acceleration of PNS in this phase. The
correlation between the PNS proper motion and the asymmetric ejecta is similar
to that in the neutron star (NS) kick of hydrodynamic origin. Both
electron-type neutrinos ($\nu_{\rm e}$) and their anti-particles
($\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$) have $\sim 10\%$ level of asymmetry between the northern
and southern hemispheres, while other heavy-leptonic neutrinos ($\nu_x$) have
much smaller asymmetry of $\sim 1 \%$. The emissions of $\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$ and
$\nu_x$ are higher in the hemisphere of stronger shock expansion whereas the
$\nu_{\rm e}$ emission is enhanced in the opposite hemisphere: in total the
neutrinos carry some linear momentum to the hemisphere of the stronger shock
expansion. The asymmetry is attributed to the non-spherical distribution of
electron-fraction ($Y_e$) in the envelope of PNS. Although it is similar to
LESA (lepton-emission self-sustained asymmetry), the $Y_e$ asymmetry seems to
be associated with the PNS motion: the latter triggers lateral circular motions
in the envelope of PNS by breaking symmetry of the matter distribution there,
which are then sustained by a combination of convection, lateral neutrino
diffusion and matter-pressure gradient. Our findings may have an influence on
the current theories on the NS kick mechanism although long-term simulations
are required to assess their impact on the later evolution.

Title:LIGO tells us LINERs are not optically thick RIAFs,"
Abstract:  Low ionization emission line regions (LINERs) are a heterogeneous collection
of up to $1/3$ of galactic nuclei in the local Universe. It is unclear whether
LINERs are simply the result of low accretion rates onto supermassive black
holes or whether they include a large number of optically thick radiatively
inefficient but super-Eddington accretion flows (RIAFs). Optically thick RIAFs
are typically disks of large scale-height or quasi-spherical gas flows. These
should be dense enough to trap and merge a large number of the stellar mass
black holes, which we expect to exist in galactic nuclei. Electromagnetic
observations of photospheres of accretion flows do not allow us to break model
degeneracies. However, gravitational wave observations probe the interior of
accretion flows where the merger of stellar mass black holes can be greatly
accelerated over the field rate. Here we show that the upper limits on the rate
of black hole mergers observed with LIGO demonstrate that most LINERs cannot be
optically thick RIAFs.

Title:Spiral-wave wind for the blue kilonova,"
Abstract:  The AT2017gfo kilonova counterpart of the binary neutron star merger event
GW170817 was characterized by an early-time bright peak in optical and UV
bands. Such blue kilonova is commonly interpreted as a signature of weak
$r$-process nucleosynthesis in a fast expanding wind whose origin is currently
debated. Numerical-relativity simulations with microphysical equations of
state, approximate neutrino transport, and turbulent viscosity reveal a new
mechanism that can power the blue kilonova. Spiral density waves in the remnant
generate a characteristic wind of mass ${\sim}10^{-2}~M_{\odot}$ and velocity
${\sim}0.2$c. The ejected material has electron fraction mostly distributed
above $0.25$ being partially reprocessed by hydrodynamic shocks in the
expanding arms. The combination of dynamical ejecta and spiral-wave wind can
account for solar system abundances of $r$-process elements and early-time
observed light curves.

Title:Another Servicing Mission to Extend Hubble Space Telescope's Science past the Next Decade,"
Abstract:  The Hubble Space Telescope has produced astonishing science over the past
thirty years. Hubble's productivity can continue to soar for years to come
provided some worn out components get upgraded. While powerful new ground-based
and space telescopes are expected to come online over the next decade, none of
them will have the UV capabilities that make Hubble a unique observatory.
Without Hubble, progress in UV and blue optical astrophysics will be halted.
Observations at these wavelengths are key for a range of unresolved
astrophysics questions, ranging from the characterization of solar system
planets to understanding interaction of galaxies with the intergalactic medium
and the formation history of the universe. Hubble will remain our only source
of high-angular resolution UV imaging and high-sensitivity UV spectroscopy for
the next two decades, offering the ability for continued unique science and
maximizing the science return from complementary observatories. Therefore, we
recommend that NASA, ESA, and the private sector study the scientific merit,
technical feasibility, and risk of a new servicing mission to Hubble to boost
its orbit, fix aging components, and expand its instrumentation. Doing so
would: 1) keep Hubble on its path to reach its unmet full potential, 2) extend
the mission's lifetime past the next decade, which will maximize the synergy of
Hubble with other upcoming facilities, and 3) enable and enhance the
continuation of scientific discoveries in UV and optical astrophysics.

Title:The Nonbinary Fraction: Looking Towards the Future of Gender Equity in Astronomy,"
Abstract:  Gender equity is one of the biggest issues facing the field of astrophysics,
and there is broad interest in addressing gender disparities within astronomy.
Many studies of these topics have been performed by professional astronomers
who are relatively unfamiliar with research in fields such as gender studies
and sociology. As a result, they adopt a normative view of gender as a binary
choice of 'male' or 'female', leaving astronomers whose genders do not fit
within that model out of such research entirely. Reductive frameworks of gender
and an overemphasis on quantification as an indicator of gendered phenomena are
harmful to people of marginalized genders, especially those who live at the
intersections of multiple axes of marginalization such as race, disability, and
socioeconomic status. In order for the astronomy community to best serve its
marginalized members as we move into the next decade, a new paradigm must be
developed. This paper aims to address the future of gender equity in astronomy
by recommending better survey practices and institutional policies based on a
more complex approach to gender.

is identified and discussed. Reddening estimates for each star were gathered
from the literature and combined to provide an estimate of the interstellar
absorption affecting each star, and we find excellent agreement with another

magnitude, $M_{K_s}$ for each of these stars, and analyze them using the

Title:Multiband Probabilistic Cataloging: A Joint Fitting Approach to Point Source Detection and Deblending,"
Abstract:  Probabilistic cataloging (PCAT) outperforms traditional cataloging methods on
single-band optical data in crowded fields (Portillo et al. 2017). We extend
our work to multiple bands, achieving greater sensitivity ($\sim$ 0.4 mag) and
greater speed (500x) compared to previous single-band results. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of multiband PCAT on mock data, both in terms of recovering
accurate posteriors in the catalog space, and in directly deblending sources.
When applied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations of M2, taking
Hubble Space Telescope data as truth, our joint fit on $r$ and $i$ band data
goes $\sim0.4$ mag deeper than single-band probabilistic cataloging and has a
false discovery rate less than 20\% for F606W$\leq 20$. Compared to DAOPHOT,
the two-band SDSS catalog fit goes nearly 1.5 magnitudes deeper using the same
data, and maintains a lower false discovery rate down to F606W$\sim 20.5$.
Given recent improvements in computational speed, multiband PCAT shows promise
in application to large-scale surveys and is a plausible framework for joint
analysis of multi-instrument observational data.

"Title:The effect of telescope aperture, scattered light, and human vision on early measurements of sunspot and group numbers","
Abstract:  Early telescopic observations of sunspots were conducted with instruments of
relatively small aperture. These instruments also suffered from a higher level
of scattered light, and the human eye served as a ""detector"". The eye's ability
to resolve small details depends on image contrast, and on average the
intensity variations smaller than $\approx$ 3\% contrast relative to background
are not detected even if they are resolved by the telescope. Here we study the
effect of these three parameters (telescope aperture, scattered light, and
detection threshold of human vision) on sunspot number, group number, and area
of sunspots. As an ""ideal"" dataset, we employ white-light (pseudo-continuum)
observations from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard of Solar
Dynamics Observatory, and we model the appearance of sunspots by degrading the
HMI images to corresponding telescope apertures with an added scattered light.
We discuss the effects of different parameters on sunspot counts and derive
functional dependencies, which could be used to normalize historical
observations of sunspot counts to common denominator.

Abstract:  We used the Plateau De Bure Interferometer to observe multiple CO and neutral
carbon transitions in a z=2.2 main sequence disk galaxy, BX610. Our observation
of CO(7-6), CO(4-3), and both far-infrared(FIR) [CI] lines complements previous
observations of H$\alpha$ and low-J CO, and reveals a galaxy that is vigorously
forming stars with UV fields (Log($G$ G$_0^{-1}) \lesssim3.25);$ although less
vigorously than local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies or most starbursting
submillimeter galaxies in the early universe. Our observations allow new
independent estimates of the cold gas mass which indicate
$M_\textrm{gas}\sim2\times10^{11}$M$_\odot$, and suggest a modestly larger
$\alpha_{\textrm{CO}}$ value of $\sim$8.2. The corresponding gas depletion
timescale is $\sim$1.5 Gyr. In addition to gas of modest density (Log($n$
cm$^3)\lesssim3$ ) heated by star formation, BX610 shows evidence for a
significant second gas component responsible for the strong high-J CO emission.
This second component might either be a high-density molecular gas component
heated by star formation in a typical photodissociation region, or could be
molecular gas excited by low-velocity C shocks. The CO(7-6)-to-FIR luminosity
ratio we observe is significantly higher than typical star-forming galaxies and
suggests that CO(7-6) is not a reliable star-formation tracer in this galaxy.

Title:Dust Transport and Processing in Centrifugally Driven Protoplanetary Disk Winds,"
Abstract:  There is evidence that protoplanetary disks--including the protosolar
one--contain crystalline dust grains on spatial scales where the dust
temperature is lower than the threshold value for their formation through
thermal annealing of amorphous interstellar silicates. We interpret these
observations in terms of an extended, magnetocentrifugally driven disk wind
that transports grains from the inner disk--where they are thermally processed
by the stellar radiation after being uplifted from the disk surfaces--to the
outer disk regions. For any disk radius $r$ there is a maximum grain size
$a_\mathrm{max}(r)$ that can be uplifted from that location: grains of size
$a$$\ll$$a_\mathrm{max}$ are carried away by the wind, whereas those with
$a$$\lesssim$$a_\mathrm{max}$ reenter the disk at larger radii. A significant
portion of the reentering grains converge to--and subsequently accumulate in--a
narrow region just beyond $r_\mathrm{max}(a)$, the maximum radius from which
grains of size $a$ can be uplifted. We show that this model can account for the
inferred crystallinity fractions in classical T Tauri and Herbig Ae disks and
for their indicated near constancy after being established early in the disk
evolution. It is also consistent with the reported radial gradients in the mean
grain size, crystallinity, and crystal composition. In addition, this model
yields the properties of the grains that remain embedded in the outflows from
protoplanetary disks and naturally explains the inferred persistence of small
grains in the surface layers of these disks.

Abstract:  SPB star HD 50230, in fact a hybrid B-type pulsator, has been observed by
CoRoT least 137 days. A nearly equidistant period spacing pattern are found
among 8 modes which are extracted from the oscillation spectrum with more than
500 frequencies. However, it is thought to be most likely accidental by
Szewczuk et al. (2014). In the present work, we analyze the 8 modes in depth
with the $\chi^2$-matching method. Based on the best fitting model (model MA),
we find that they can be well explained as a sequences of consecutive dipolar
$(l,~m)=(1,~0)$. The period discrepancies between observations and the best
fitting model are within 100 s except for the outlier which is up to 300 s.
Based on the calculated CMMs, we find that, for pure g-mode oscillations, the
buoyancy radius $\Lambda_{0}$ can be precisely measured with the
$\chi^2$-matching method between observations and calculations. It represents
the ""Propagation time"" of the g-mode from stellar surface to center. It is of
$\Lambda_{0}=245.78\pm0.59~\mu$Hz with a precision of 0.24\%. In addition, we
also find that HD 50230 is a metal-rich ($Z_{\rm init}=0.034-0.043$) star with
a mass of $M=6.15-6.27~{\rm M_{\odot}}$. It is still located on
hydrogen-burning phase with central hydrogen $X_{\rm C}=0.298-0.316$ (or
$X_{\rm C}=0.306^{+0.010}_{-0.008}$), therefore has a convective core with a
radius of $R_{\rm cc}=0.525-0.536~{\rm R_{\odot}}$ (or $R_{\rm
cc}=0.531^{+0.005}_{-0.006}~{\rm R_{\odot}}$). In order to well interpret the
structure of observed period spacing pattern, the convective core overshooting
($f_{\rm ov}=0.0175-0.0200$) and the extra diffusion mixing ($\log D_{\rm
mix}=3.7-3.9$) should be taken into account in theoretical models.

for an absorption line at $\approx 1~\mathrm{keV}$ and/or $\approx
1.4~\mathrm{keV}$. The hard component shows pulsations at $P \approx
31.908~\mathrm{s}$ (pulsed fraction $0.84 \pm 0.10$), agreeing with the pulse
period seen previously in outbursts, but no pulsations were found in the soft
excess (pulsed fraction $\lesssim 31\%$). We conclude that the pulsed hard
component suggests low-level accretion onto the neutron star poles, while the
soft excess seems to originate from the entire NS surface. We speculate that,
in quiescence, the source switches between a soft thermal-dominated state (when
the propeller effect is at work) and a relatively hard state with low-level
accretion, and use the propeller cutoff to estimate the magnetic field of the
system to be $\lesssim 8.4 \times 10^{11}~\mathrm{G}$. We compare the quiescent
thermal $L_X$ predicted by the standard deep crustal heating model to our
observations and find that RX J0812.4-3114 has a high thermal $L_X$, at or
above the prediction for minimum cooling mechanisms. This suggests that RX
J0812.4-3114 either contains a relatively low-mass NS with minimum cooling, or
that the system may be young enough that the NS has not fully cooled from the
supernova explosion.

Title:VER J2227+608: A Hadronic PeVatron Pulsar Wind Nebula?,"
Abstract:  We report the detection of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission from the
very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray source VER J2227+608 associated with the
""tail"" region of SNR G106.3+2.7. The GeV $\gamma$-ray emission is extended and
spatially coincident with molecular clouds traced by CO emission. The broadband
GeV to TeV emission of VER J2227+608 can be well fitted by a single power-law
function with an index of 1.90$\pm$0.04, without obvious indication of spectral
cutoff toward high energies. The pure leptonic model for the $\gamma$-ray
emission can be marginally ruled out by the X-ray and TeV data. In the hadronic
model, the low energy content of CRs and the hard $\gamma$-ray spectrum, in
combination with the center-bright source structure, suggest that VER J2227+608
may be powered by the PWN instead of shocks of the SNR. And the cutoff energy
of the proton distribution needs to be higher than $\sim$ 400 TeV, which makes
it an attractive PeVatron candidate. Future observations by the upcoming Large
High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and the Cherenkov Telescope Array
in the north (CTA-North) could distinguish these models and constrain the
maximum energy of cosmic rays in supernova remnants.

Title:The propagation of choked jet outflows in power-law external media,"
Abstract:  Observations of both gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) point to the idea that some relativistic jets are suffocated by their
environment before we observe them. In these ""choked"" jets, all the jet's
kinetic energy is transferred into a hot and narrow cocoon of near-uniform
pressure. We consider the evolution of an elongated, axisymmetric cocoon formed
by a choked jet as it expands into a cold power-law ambient medium $\rho
\propto R^{-\alpha}$, in the case where the shock is decelerating ($\alpha<3$).
The evolution proceeds in three stages, with two breaks in behaviour: the first
occurs once the outflow has doubled its initial width, and the second once it
has doubled its initial height. Using the Kompaneets approximation, we derive
analytical formulae for the shape of the cocoon shock, and obtain approximate
expressions for the height and width of the outflow versus time in each of the
three dynamical regimes. The asymptotic behaviour is different for flat
($\alpha \le 2$) and steep ($2 < \alpha < 3$) density profiles. Comparing the
analytical model to numerical simulations, we find agreement to within $\sim15$
per cent out to 45 degrees from the axis, but discrepancies of a factor of 2-3
near the equator. The shape of the cocoon shock can be measured directly in
AGNs, and is also expected to affect the early light from failed GRB jets.
Observational constraints on the shock geometry provide a useful diagnostic of
the jet properties, even long after jet activity ceases.

Title:Primordial Black Holes from Inflation with Nonminimal Derivative Coupling,"
Abstract:  We propose a novel enhancement mechanism of the curvature perturbations in
the nonminimal derivative coupling inflation model with a coupling parameter
related to the inflaton field. By considering a special form of the coupling
parameter as a function of the inflaton, a period of ultra-slow-roll inflation
can be realized due to the gravitationally enhanced friction, and the resulting
power spectrum of the curvature perturbations has a sharp peak, which is large
enough to produce the primordial black holes. Under this mechanism, we can
easily obtain a sharp mass spectrum of primordial black holes around specific
masses such as $\mathcal{O}(10)M_\odot$, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})M_\odot$, and
$\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})M_\odot$, which can explain the LIGO events, the
ultrashort-timescale microlensing events in OGLE data, and the most of dark
matter, respectively.

Title:Mass measurements for two binary pulsars discovered in the PALFA survey,"
Abstract:  In this paper, we present the results of timing observations of PSRs
J1949+3106 and J1950+2414, two binary millisecond pulsars discovered in data
from the Arecibo ALFA pulsar survey (PALFA). The timing parameters include
precise measurements of the proper motions of both pulsars, which show that PSR
J1949+3106 has a transversal motion very similar to that of an object in the
local standard of rest. The timing also includes measurements of the Shapiro
delay and the rate of advance of periastron for both systems. Assuming general
relativity, these allow estimates of the masses of the components of the two
systems; for PSR J1949+3106, the pulsar mass is $M_p \, = \,
1.34^{+0.17}_{-0.15} \, M_{\odot}$ and the companion mass $M_c \, = \,
0.81^{+0.06}_{-0.05}\, M_{\odot}$; for PSR J1950+2414 $M_p \, = \, 1.496 \, \pm
\, 0.023\, M_{\odot}$ and $M_c \, = \, 0.280^{+0.005}_{-0.004}\, M_{\odot}$
(all values 68.3 % confidence limits). We use these masses and proper motions
to investigate the evolutionary history of both systems: PSR J1949+3106 is
likely the product of a low-kick supernova; PSR J1950+2414 is a member of a new
class of eccentric millisecond pulsar binaries with an unknown formation
mechanism. We discuss the proposed hypotheses for the formations of these
systems in light of our new mass measurements.

Title:Emission peaks in the light curve of core collapse supernovae by late jets,"
Abstract:  We build a toy model where the central object, i.e., a newly born neutron
star or a black hole, launches jets at late times and show that these jets
might account for peaks in the light curve of some peculiar (i.e., having
unusual light curves) core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) when the jets interact
with the CCSN ejecta. We assume that the central object accretes fallback
material and launches two short-lived opposite jets weeks to months after the
explosion. We model each jet-ejecta interaction as a spherically symmetric
`mini explosion' that takes place inside the ejecta. We assume that each `mini
explosion' adds emission that is symmetric in time around the late peak, and
with a rise in emission power that has the same slope as that of the main CCSN
light curve. In total we use 12 parameters in the toy model. In our toy model
late jets form stronger emission peaks than early jets. Late jets with a
kinetic energy of only about one percent of the kinetic energy of the CCSN
itself might form strong emission peaks. We apply our toy model to the
brightest peak of the enigmatic CCSN iPTF14hls that has several extra peaks in
its light curve. We can fit this emission peak with our toy model when we take
the kinetic energy of the jets to be about one to two percent of the CCSN
energy, and the shocked ejecta mass to be about three percent of the ejecta
mass.

Abstract:  Utilizing the SDSS-DR13 spectroscopic dataset, we create a new

$\mathtt{GalWCat19}$ clusters range in redshift between $0.01 - 0.2$ and in
mass between $(0.4 - 14) \times 10^{14}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. The cluster catalog
provides a large number of cluster parameters including sky position, redshift,

the density is 200 times the critical density of the Universe. The galaxy

Title:Metallicity gradients in small and nearby spiral galaxies,"
Abstract:  Spectra of HII regions obtained with Gemini/GMOS are used to derive the
radial metallicity gradients of four small, low-mass spiral galaxies. The
analysis of the outer disk of one of them, NGC 1058, uncovers the
characteristic flattening found in similar extended disk galaxies. After
combining these data with published long-slit observations of nearby spiral
galaxies, no evidence for a dependence of the disk scale length-normalized
metallicity gradients with stellar mass is found, down to log(M*/Msun) ~ 8.5.
The abundance gradients derived from these observations are compared to
predictions from recent cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution, finding
that in several cases the simulations fail to reproduce the mean steepening of
the gradients, expressed in dex/kpc, with decreasing stellar mass for
present-day galaxies, or do not extend to sufficiently small stellar masses for
a meaningful comparison. The mean steepening of the abundance gradients (in
dex/kpc) with decreasing disk scale length is in qualitative agreement with
predictions from the inside-out model of Boissier & Prantzos, although the
predicted slopes are systematically steeper than observed. This indicates the
necessity of including processes such as outflows and radial mixing in similar
models of galactic chemical evolution. Published spatially resolved metallicity
and photometric data of dwarf irregular galaxies suggest that significant, but
transitory, metallicity gradients can develop for systems that have experienced
recent (t < 100 Myr) enhanced star formation in their inner disks.

Title:Gamma-ray Bursts as distance indicators through a machine learning approach,"
Abstract:  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are spectacularly energetic events, with the
potential to inform on the early universe and its evolution, once their
redshifts are known. Unfortunately, determining redshifts is a painstaking
procedure requiring detailed follow-up multi-wavelength observations often
involving various astronomical facilities, which have to be rapidly pointed at
these serendipitous events. Here we use Machine Learning algorithms to infer
redshifts from a collection of observed temporal and spectral features of GRBs.
We obtained a very high correlation coefficient ($0.96$) between the inferred
and the observed redshifts, and a small dispersion (with a mean square error of
$0.003$) in the test set. The addition of plateau afterglow parameters improves
the predictions by $61.4\%$ compared to previous results. The GRB luminosity
function and cumulative density rate evolutions, obtained from predicted and
observed redshift are in excellent agreement indicating that GRBs are effective
distance indicators and a reliable step for the cosmic distance ladder.

Title:The HI Bias during the Epoch of Reionization,"
Abstract:  The neutral hydrogen (HI) and its 21 cm line are promising probes to the
reionization process of the intergalactic medium (IGM). To use this probe
effectively, it is imperative to have a good understanding on how the neutral
hydrogen traces the underlying matter distribution. Here we study this problem
using semi-numerical modeling by combining the HI in the IGM and the HI from
halos during the epoch of reionization (EoR), and investigate the evolution and
the scale-dependence of the neutral fraction bias as well as the 21 cm line
bias. We find that the neutral fraction bias on large scales is negative during
reionization, and its absolute value on large scales increases during the early
stage of reionization and then decreases during the late stage. During the late
stage of reionization, there is a transition scale at which the HI bias
transits from negative on large scales to positive on small scales, and this
scale increases as the reionization proceeds to the end.

Abstract:  We present high-resolution and high-quality UVES spectroscopic data of the
metal-poor double-lined spectroscopic binary CS 22876--032 ([Fe/H] $\sim -3.7$
dex), with the goal to derive the $^6$Li/$^7$Li isotopic ratio by analysing the
\ion{Li}{i} $\lambda$~670.8~nm doublet. We coadd all 28 useful spectra
normalised and corrected for radial velocity to the rest frame of the primary
star. We fit the Li profile with a grid of the 3D-NLTE synthetic spectra, to
take into account the line profile asymmetries induced by stellar convection,
and perform Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the uncertainty of the fit of
the Li line profile. We check that the veiling factor does not affect the
derived isotopic ratio, $^6$Li/$^7$Li, and only modifies the Li abundance,
A(Li), by about 0.15~dex. The best fit of the Li profile of the primary star
provides A(Li)~$ = 2.17 \pm 0.01$~dex and $^6$Li/$^7$Li~$=8^{+2}_{-5}$\% at
68\% confidence level. In addition, we improve the Li abundance of the
secondary star at A(Li)~$= 1.55 \pm 0.04$~dex, which is about 0.6~dex lower
than that of the primary star. The analysis of the Li profile of the primary
star is consistent with no detection of $^6$Li and provides an upper-limit to
the isotopic ratio of $^6$Li/$^7$Li~$< 10$\% at this very low metallicity,
about 0.5~dex lower in metallicity than previous attempts for detection of
$^6$Li in extremely metal poor stars. These results do not solve or worsen the
cosmological $^7$Li problem, nor support the need for non standard $^6$Li
production in the early Universe.

Title:Forecasts of redshift drift constraints on cosmological parameters,"
Abstract:  Cosmological observations usually map our present-day past light cone.
However, it is also possible to compare different past light cones. This is the
concept behind the redshift drift, a model-independent probe of fundamental
cosmology. In simple physical terms, this effectively allows us to watch the
Universe expand in real time. While current facilities only allow sensitivities
several orders of magnitude worse than the expected signal, it should be
possible to detect it with forthcoming ones. Here we discuss the potential
impact of measurements by three such facilities: the Extremely Large Telescope
(the subject of most existing redshift drift forecasts), but also the Square
Kilometre Array and intensity mapping experiments. For each of these we assume
the measurement sensitivities estimated respectively in Liske {\it et al.}
(2008), Klockner {\it et al.} (2015) and Yu {\it et al.} (2014). We focus on
the role of these measurements in constraining dark energy scenarios,
highlighting the fact that although on their own they yield comparatively weak
constraints, they do probe regions of parameter space that are typically
different from those probed by other experiments, as well as being
redshift-dependent. Specifically, we quantify how combinations of several
redshift drift measurements at different redshifts, or combinations of redshift
drift measurements with those from other canonical cosmological probes, can
constrain some representative dark energy models. Our conclusion is that a
model-independent mapping of the expansion of the universe from redshift $z=0$
to $z=4$---a challenging but feasible goal for the next generation of
astrophysical facilities---can have a significant impact on fundamental
cosmology.

Title:On simple analytic models of microlensing amplification statistics,"
Abstract:  Gravitational microlensing is a key probe of the nature of dark matter and
its distribution on the smallest scales. For many practical purposes,
confronting theory to observation requires to model the probability that a
light source is highly amplified by many-lens systems. This article reviews
four simple analytic models of the amplification probability distribution,
based on different approximations: (i) the strongest-lens model; (ii) the
multiplicative model, where the total amplification is assumed to be the
product of all the lenses' individual amplifications; (iii) a hybrid version of
the previous two; and (iv) an empirical fitting function. In particular, a new
derivation of the multiplicative amplification distribution is proposed,
thereby correcting errors in the literature. Finally, the accuracy of these
models is tested against ray-shooting simulations. They all produce excellent
results as long as lenses are light and rare (low optical depth); however, for
larger optical depths, none of them succeeds in capturing the relevant features
of the amplification distribution. This conclusion emphasizes the crucial role
of lens-lens coupling at large optical depths.

Title:Type IIn Supernova Light Curves Powered by Forward and Reverse Shocks,"
Abstract:  We present a bolometric light curve model of Type IIn supernovae powered by
supernova ejecta colliding with a circumstellar medium. We estimate the
conversion efficiency of the ejecta's kinetic energy to radiation at the
reverse and forward shocks and find that a large density contrast makes a
difference in the efficiency. The emission from the reverse shock can maintain
high efficiency for a long time, and becomes important at the late phase of the
light curve. We first construct a semi-analytical model that is applicable to
the late phase of the light curve when the diffusion time of photons in the
shocked region becomes negligible. We further develop radiation transfer
simulations that incorporate these physical processes into the light curve. The
numerical calculations predict light curves at early phases, which are testable
by present and future short-cadence surveys. We compare our model with the
bolometric light curve constructed from observations for a type IIn supernova
2005ip. Due to the reduced efficiency at the forward shock, we find from our
model that the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star was $\approx 1\times
10^{-2}\ {\rm M_\odot \ yr^{-1}}$ for a wind velocity of $100\ {\rm km \
s^{-1}}$, an order of magnitude higher compared to previous work that used
simple assumptions of the efficiency. This highlights the importance of taking
these two components into account when extracting the physical parameters from
observations.

Title:Timescale of twin-peak quasi-periodic oscillations and mass of accreting neutron stars,"
Abstract:  Einstein's general relativity predicts that orbital motion of accreted gas
approaching a neutron star (NS) in a NS low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) system
occurs on a time scale proportional to the NS mass. Radiation of the gas
accounts for most of the observed LMXBs variability. In more than a dozen of
sources twin-peak quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been observed.
Inspired by the expected proportionality between periods of orbital motion and
NS mass we present a straightforward comparison among these sources. We
investigate relations between QPO periods and their ratios and identify
characteristic time scales of QPOs associated to individual sources. These
timescales are likely determined by the relative mass of each NS. We show that
the characteristic time scale of the millisecond pulsar XTE J1807.4-294 is
longer than for most other NS LMXBs. Consequently, models of QPOs that consider
geodesic orbital frequencies imply that the X-ray pulsars' mass has to be about
50 % higher than the average mass of other sources. Consideration of other
X-ray pulsars indicates that the exceptionality of XTE J1807.4-294 cannot be
related to NS magnetic field in any simple manner. We suggest that QPOs
observed in this source can help to discriminate between the proposed versions
of the NS equation of state.

Title:Fundamental Transverse Vibrations of the Active Region Solar Corona,"
Abstract:  Some high-resolution observations have revealed that the active-region solar
corona is filled with myriads of thin strands even in apparently uniform
regions with no resolved loops. This fine structure can host collective
oscillations involving a large portion of the corona due to the coupling of the
motions of the neighbouring strands. We study these vibrations and the possible
observational effects. Here we theoretically investigate the collective
oscillations inherent to the fine structure of the corona. We have called them
fundamental vibrations because they cannot exist in a uniform medium. We use
the T-matrix technique to find the normal modes of random arrangements of
parallel strands. We consider an increasing number of tubes to understand the
vibrations of a huge number of tubes of a large portion of the corona. We
additionally generate synthetic time-distance Doppler and line broadening
diagrams of the vibrations of a coronal region to compare with observations. We
have found that the fundamental vibrations are in the form of clusters of tubes
where not all the tubes participate in the collective mode. The periods are
distributed over a wide band of values. The width of the band increases with
the number of strands but rapidly reaches an approximately constant value. The
frequency band associated with the fine structure of the corona depends on the
minimum separation between strands. We have found that the coupling between the
strands is of large extent. The synthetic Dopplergrams and line-broadening maps
show signatures of collective vibrations, not present in the case of purely
random individual kink vibrations. We conclude that the fundamental vibrations
of the corona can contribute to the energy budget of the corona and they may
have an observational signature.

Abstract:  We examine the range of rest-mass densities, temperatures and magnetic fields

conditions under which the ideal magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) breaks down using
recently computed conductivities of warm, magnetized plasma created in such
systems. While previous dissipative MHD studies of BNSMs assumed that
dissipation sets in due to low conduction at low rest-mass densities, we show
that this paradigm must be shifted: the ideal MHD is applicable up to the
regime where the hydrodynamic description of matter breaks down. We also find
that the Hall effect can be important at low densities and low temperatures,
where it can induce a non-dissipative rearrangement of the magnetic field.
Finally, we mark the region in temperature-density plane where the hydrodynamic
description breaks down.

period. We also briefly consider how a strong growth can affect the spectral
index of longer wavelengths preceding the growth, and show that even the
conversion of isocurvature modes likely cannot lead to a stronger growth. These
results have implications for the formation of primordial black holes, and
other phenomena which require a large amplitude of power spectrum at short
scales.

Title:Expanding the Timeline for Earth's Photosynthetic Red Edge Biosignature,"
Abstract:  When Carl Sagan observed the Earth during a Gallileo fly-by in 1993, he found
a widely distributed surface pigment with a sharp reflection edge in the red
part of the spectrum, which, together with the abundance of gaseous oxygen and
methane in extreme thermodynamic disequilibrium, were strongly suggestive of
the presence of life on Earth. This widespread pigmentation that could not be
explained by geological processes alone, is caused by the cellular structure of
vegetation - a mechanism for potentially limiting damage to chlorophyll and/or
limiting water loss. The distinctive increase in the red portion of Earth's
global reflectance spectrum is called the vegetation red edge in astrobiology
literature and is one of the proposed surface biosignatures to search for on
exoplanets and exomoons. Earth's surface vegetation has only been widespread
for about half a billion years, providing a surface biosignature for
approximately 1/9th our planet's lifetime. However, as chlorophyll is present
in many forms of life on Earth, like cyanobacteria, algae, lichen, corals, as
well as leafy vegetation, such a spectral red edge feature could indicate a
wide range of life, expanding its use for the search for surface biosignatures
beyond vegetation alone to a time long before vegetation became widespread on
Earth. We show how lichens could extend the presence of Earth's red edge
surface biofeature to 1.2 Gyr ago, while ocean surface algae and cyanobacteria
could extend it to over 2 Gyr ago, expanding the use of a photosynthetic red
edge to earlier times in Earth's history.

"Title:Commensal, Multi-user Observations with an Ethernet-based Jansky Very Large Array","
Abstract:  Over the last decade, the continuing decline in the cost of digital computing
technology has brought about a dramatic transformation in how digital
instrumentation for radio astronomy is developed and operated. In most cases,
it is now possible to interface consumer computing hardware, e.g. inexpensive
graphics processing units and storage devices, directly to the raw data streams
produced by radio telescopes. Such systems bring with them myriad benefits:
straightforward upgrade paths, cost savings through leveraging an economy of
scale, and a lowered barrier to entry for scientists and engineers seeking to
add new instrument capabilities. Additionally, the typical data-interconnect
technology used with general-purpose computing hardware -- Ethernet --
naturally permits multiple subscribers to a single raw data stream. This allows
multiple science programs to be conducted in parallel. When combined with broad
bandwidths and wide primary fields of view, radio telescopes become capable of
achieving many science goals simultaneously. Moreover, because many science
programs are not strongly dependent on observing cadence and direction (e.g.
searches for extraterrestrial intelligence and radio transient surveys), these
so-called ""commensal"" observing programs can dramatically increase the
scientific productivity and discovery potential of an observatory. In this
whitepaper, we detail a project to add an Ethernet-based commensal observing
mode to the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and discuss how this mode could be
leveraged to conduct a powerful program to constrain the distribution of
advanced life in the universe through a search for radio emission indicative of
technology. We also discuss other potential science use-cases for the system,
and how the system could be used for technology development towards
next-generation processing systems for the Next Generation VLA.

Title:Searching for gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters at low redshift,"
Abstract:  We report the identification of a positive cross-correlation signal between
the unresolved $\gamma$-ray emission, measured by the \emph{Fermi} Large Area
Telescope, and four different galaxy cluster catalogues. The selected
catalogues peak at low-redshift and span different frequency bands, including
infrared, optical and X-rays. The signal-to-noise ratio of the detected
cross-correlation amounts to 3.5 in the most significant case. We investigate
and comment about its possible origin, in terms of compact $\gamma$-ray
emission from AGNs inside clusters or diffuse emission from the intracluster
medium. The analysis has been performed by introducing an accurate estimation
of the cross-correlation power-spectrum covariance matrix, built with mock
realisations of the gamma and galaxy cluster maps. Different methods to produce
the mock realizations starting from the data maps have been investigated and
compared, identifying suitable techniques which can be generalized to other
cross-correlation studies.

Title:2PBC J0658.0-1746: a hard X-ray eclipsing polar in the orbital period gap,"
Abstract:  The hard X-ray source 2PBC J0658.0-1746 was proposed as an eclipsing magnetic
cataclysmic variable of the polar type, based on optical follow-ups. We present
the first spectral and timing analysis at X-ray energies with XMM-Newton,
complemented with archival X-ray, optical, IR photometry and spectroscopy. The
X-ray emission shows bright and faint phases and total eclipses recurring every
2.38 h, consistent with optical properties. This firmly identifies 2PBC
J0658.0-1746 as an eclipsing polar, the second hard X-ray selected in the
orbital period gap. The X-ray orbital modulation changes from cycle-to-cycle
and the X-ray flux is strongly variable over the years, implying a
non-stationary mass accretion rate both on short and long timescales. The X-ray
eclipses allow to refine the orbital ephemeris with period 0.09913398(4) d, and
to constrain the binary inclination $79^{\rm\,o}\lesssim i \lesssim
90^{\rm\,o}$ and the mass ratio 0.18$\rm <M_2/M_{WD}<$0.40. A companion mass
M$_{2}=0.2-0.25\rm\,M_{\odot}$ with a radius R$_{2}=0.24-0.26\rm\,R_{\odot}$
and spectral type $\sim$M4, at D$=209^{+3}_{-2}\rm\,pc$, is derived. A lower
limit to the white dwarf mass of $\sim0.6\,\rm\,M_{\odot}$ is obtained from the
X-ray spectrum. An upper limit to the magnetic colatitude, $\beta \lesssim
50^{\rm\,o}$, and a shift in azimuth, $\psi\sim14^{\rm\,o}$, of the main
accreting pole are also estimated. The optical/IR spectral energy distribution
shows large excess in the mid-IR due to lower harmonics of cyclotron emission.
A high-state mass accretion rate
$\rm\,\sim0.4-1\times10^{-10}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$, lower than that of
cataclysmic variables above the gap and close to that of systems below it, is
estimated. With 2PBC J0658.0-1746, the number of hard X-ray selected polars
increases to thirteen members, suggesting that they are not as rare as
previously believed.

Title:Extragalactic astrophysics with next-generation CMB experiments,"
Abstract:  Planck, SPT and ACT surveys have clearly demonstrated that Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) experiments, while optimised for cosmological measurements,
have made important contributions to the field of extragalactic astrophysics in
the last decade. Future CMB experiments have the potential to make even greater
contributions. One example is the detection of high-z galaxies with extreme
gravitational amplifications. The combination of flux boosting and of
stretching of the images has allowed the investigation of the structure of
galaxies at z ~3 with the astounding spatial resolution of about 60 pc. Another
example is the detection of proto-clusters of dusty galaxies at high z when
they may not yet possess the hot intergalactic medium allowing their detection
in X-rays or via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Next generation CMB experiments,
like PICO, CORE, CMB-Bharat from space and Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 from
the ground, will discover several thousands of strongly lensed galaxies out to
z~6 or more and of galaxy proto-clusters caught in the phase when their member
galaxies where forming the bulk of their {stars. They will also detect tens of
thousands of local dusty galaxies and thousands of radio sources at least up to
z~5. Moreover they will measure the polarized emission of thousands of radio
sources and of dusty galaxies at mm/sub-mm wavelengths.

Title:Non-Gaussian CMB and LSS statistics beyond polyspectra,"
Abstract:  Cosmic inflation may have led to non-Gaussian initial conditions that cannot
be fully parametrised by 3- and/or 4-point functions. In this work, we discuss
various strategies to search for primordial non-Gaussianity beyond polyspectra
with the help of cosmological data. Our starting point is a generalised local
ansatz for the primordial curvature perturbation $\zeta$ of the form $\zeta =
\zeta_{\rm G} + \mathcal{F}_{\rm NG} (\zeta_{\rm G})$, where $\zeta_{\rm G}$ is
a Gaussian random field and $\mathcal{F}_{\rm NG}$ is an arbitrary function
parametrising non-Gaussianity that, in principle, could be reconstructed from
data. Noteworthily, in the case of multi-field inflation, the function
$\mathcal{F}_{\rm NG}$ can be shown to be determined by the shape of
tomographic sections of the landscape potential responsible for driving
inflation. We discuss how this generalised local ansatz leads to a probability
distribution functional that may be used to extract information about inflation
from current and future observations. In particular, we derive various classes
of probability distribution functions suitable for the statistical analysis of
the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure.

Title:Dawn of the dark: unified dark sectors and the EDGES Cosmic Dawn 21-cm signal,"
Abstract:  While the origin and composition of dark matter and dark energy remains
unknown, it is possible that they might represent two manifestations of a
single entity, as occurring in unified dark sector models. On the other hand,
advances in our understanding of the dark sector of the Universe might arise
from Cosmic Dawn, the epoch when the first stars formed. In particular, the
first detection of the global 21-cm absorption signal at Cosmic Dawn from the
EDGES experiment opens up a new arena wherein to test models of dark matter and
dark energy. Here, we consider generalized and modified Chaplygin gas models as
candidate unified dark sector models. We first constrain these models against
Cosmic Microwave Background data from the \textit{Planck} satellite, before
exploring how the inclusion of the global 21-cm signal measured by EDGES can
improve limits on the model parameters, finding that the uncertainties on the
parameters of the Chaplygin gas models can be reduced by a factor between $1.5$
and $10$. We also find that within the generalized Chaplygin gas model, the
tension between the CMB and local determinations of the Hubble constant $H_0$
is reduced from $\approx 4\sigma$ to $\approx 1.3\sigma$. In conclusion, we
find that the global 21-cm signal at Cosmic Dawn can provide an extraordinary
window onto the physics of unified dark sectors.

Title:Long-period variables in the Gaia era,"
Abstract:  The second Gaia data release (DR2, spring 2018) included a unique all-sky
catalogue of large-amplitude long-period variables (LPVs) containing Miras and
semi-regular variables. These stars are on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB),
and are characterized by high luminosity, changing surface composition, and
intense mass loss, that make them of paramount importance for stellar,
galactic, and extra-galactic studies.
An initial investigation of LPVs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from the
DR2 catalog of LPVs has revealed the possibility to disentangle O-rich and
C-rich stars using a combination of optical Gaia and infrared 2MASS photometry.
The so-called Gaia-2MASS diagram constructed to achieve this has further been
shown to enable the identification of sub-groups of AGB stars among the O-rich
and C-rich LPVs.
Here, we extend this initial study of the Gaia-2MASS diagram to the Small
Magellanic Cloud and the Galaxy, and use a variability amplitude proxy to
identify LPVs from the full Gaia DR2 archive. We show that the remarkable
properties found in the LMC also apply to these other stellar systems.
Interesting features, moreover, emerge as a result of the different
metallicities between the three stellar environments, which we highlight in
this exploratory presentation of Gaia's potential to study stellar populations
harboring LPVs.
Finally, we look ahead to the future, and highlight the power of the
exploitation of Gaia RP spectra for the identification of carbon stars using
solely Gaia data in forthcoming data releases, as revealed in an Image of the
Week published by the Gaia consortium on the European Space Agency's web site.
These proceedings include three animated images that can be used as outreach

Title:Gravitational Waves from Black Holes in Merging Ultra-Dwarf Galaxies,"
Abstract:  The origin of the black-hole:black-hole mergers discovered through
gravitational waves with for example the LIGO/Virgo collaboration are a
mystery. We investigate the idea that some of these black holes originate from
the centers of extremely low-mass ultra-dwarf galaxies that have merged
together in the distant past at $z>1$. Extrapolating the central black hole to
stellar mass ratio suggests that the black holes in these mergers could arise
from galaxies of masses $\sim 10^{5} - 10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}\,$. We investigate
whether these galaxies merge enough, or too much, to be consistent with the
observed GW rate of $\sim 9.7-101$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ using the latest
LIGO/Virgo results. We show that in the nearby universe the merger rate and
number densities of ultra-dwarf galaxies are too low, by an order or magnitude,
to produce these black hole mergers. However, by considering that the merger
fraction, merger-time scales, and the number densities of low-mass galaxies all
conspire at $z>1-1.5$ to increase the merger rate for these galaxies at higher
redshifts we argue that it is possible that some of the observed GW events
arise from BHs in the centers of low-mass galaxies. The major uncertainty in
this calculation is the dynamical time-scales for black holes in low-mass
galaxies. Our results however suggest a very long BH merger time-scale of 4-7
Gyr, consistent with an extended black hole merger history. Further simulations
are needed to verify this possibility, however our theory can be tested by
searching for host galaxies of gravitational wave events. Results from these
searches would will put limits on dwarf galaxy mergers and/or the presence and
formation mechanisms of black holes through PopIII stars in the lowest mass
galaxies.

Title:IDEAS: Immersive Dome Experiences for Accelerating Science,"
Abstract:  Astrophysics lies at the crossroads of big datasets (such as the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope and Gaia), open source software to visualize and
interpret high dimensional datasets (such as Glue, WorldWide Telescope, and
OpenSpace), and uniquely skilled software engineers who bridge data science and
research fields. At the same time, more than 4,000 planetariums across the
globe immerse millions of visitors in scientific data. We have identified the
potential for critical synergy across data, software, hardware, locations, and
content that -- if prioritized over the next decade -- will drive discovery in
astronomical research. Planetariums can and should be used for the advancement
of scientific research. Current facilities such as the Hayden Planetarium in
New York City, Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Morrison Planetarium in San
Francisco, the Iziko Planetarium and Digital Dome Research Consortium in Cape
Town, and Visualization Center C in Norrkoping are already developing software
which ingests catalogs of astronomical and multi-disciplinary data critical for
exploration research primarily for the purpose of creating scientific
storylines for the general public. We propose a transformative model whereby
scientists become the audience and explorers in planetariums, utilizing
software for their own investigative purposes. In this manner, research
benefits from the authentic and unique experience of data immersion contained
in an environment bathed in context and equipped for collaboration.
Consequently, in this white paper we argue that over the next decade the
research astronomy community should partner with planetariums to create
visualization-based research opportunities for the field. Realizing this vision
will require new investments in software and human capital.

that gamma-ray families featuring halos are predominantly produced (more than

Abstract:  FARSIDE (Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the Dark ages and

interferometric array on the farside of the Moon. A NASA-funded design study,
focused on the instrument, a deployment rover, the lander and base station,
delivered an architecture broadly consistent with the requirements for a Probe
mission. This notional architecture consists of 128 dual polarization antennas
deployed across a 10 km area by a rover, and tethered to a base station for
central processing, power and data transmission to the Lunar Gateway. FARSIDE
would provide the capability to image the entire sky each minute in 1400
channels spanning frequencies from 100 kHz to 40 MHz, extending down two orders
of magnitude below bands accessible to ground-based radio astronomy. The lunar
farside can simultaneously provide isolation from terrestrial radio frequency
interference, auroral kilometric radiation, and plasma noise from the solar
wind. This would enable near-continuous monitoring of the nearest stellar
systems in the search for the radio signatures of coronal mass ejections and
energetic particle events, and would also detect the magnetospheres for the
nearest candidate habitable exoplanets. Simultaneously, FARSIDE would be used
to characterize similar activity in our own solar system, from the Sun to the
outer planets, including the hypothetical Planet Nine. Through precision
calibration via an orbiting beacon, and exquisite foreground characterization,
FARSIDE would also measure the Dark Ages global 21-cm signal at redshifts
z=50-100. The unique observational window offered by FARSIDE would enable an
abundance of additional science ranging from sounding of the lunar subsurface

Title:In Pursuit of Galactic Archaeology: Astro2020 Science White Paper,"
Abstract:  The next decade affords tremendous opportunity to achieve the goals of
Galactic archaeology. That is, to reconstruct the evolutionary narrative of the
Milky Way, based on the empirical data that describes its current
morphological, dynamical, temporal and chemical structures. Here, we describe a
path to achieving this goal. The critical observational objective is a
Galaxy-scale, contiguous, comprehensive mapping of the disk's phase space,
tracing where the majority of the stellar mass resides. An ensemble of recent,
ongoing, and imminent surveys are working to deliver such a transformative
stellar map. Once this empirical description of the dust-obscured disk is
assembled, we will no longer be operationally limited by the observational
data. The primary and significant challenge within stellar astronomy and
Galactic archaeology will then be in fully utilizing these data. We outline the
next-decade framework for obtaining and then realizing the potential of the
data to chart the Galactic disk via its stars. One way to support the
investment in the massive data assemblage will be to establish a Galactic
Archaeology Consortium across the ensemble of stellar missions. This would
reflect a long-term commitment to build and support a network of personnel in a
dedicated effort to aggregate, engineer, and transform stellar measurements
into a comprehensive perspective of our Galaxy.

Title:On the prospect of using the maximum circular velocity of halos to encapsulate assembly bias in the galaxy-halo connection,"
Abstract:  We investigate a conceptual modification of the halo occupation distribution
approach, using the halos' present-day maximal circular velocity, $\vmax$, as
an alternative to halo mass. In particular, using a semi-analytic galaxy
formation model applied to the Millennium WMAP7 simulation, we explore the
extent that switching to $\vmax$ as the primary halo property incorporates the
effects of assembly bias into the formalism. We consider fixed number density
galaxy samples ranked by stellar mass and examine the variations in the halo
occupation functions with either halo concentration or formation time. We find
that using $\vmax$ results in a significant reduction in the occupancy
variation of the central galaxies, particularly for concentration. The
satellites occupancy variation on the other hand increases in all cases. We
find effectively no change in the halo clustering dependence on concentration,
for fixed bins of $\vmax$ compared to fixed halo mass. Most crucially, we
calculate the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering by comparing the
amplitude of clustering to that of a shuffled galaxy sample, finding that the
level of galaxy assembly bias remains largely unchanged. Our results suggest
that while using $\vmax$ as a proxy for halo mass diminishes some of occupancy
variations exhibited in the galaxy-halo relation, it is not able to encapsulate
the effects of assembly bias potentially present in galaxy clustering. The use
of other more complex halo properties, such as $\vpeak$, the peak value of
$\vmax$ over the assembly history, provides some improvement and warrants
further investigation.

Title:Measuring the Obscuring Column of a Disk Megamaser AGN in a Nearby Merger,"
Abstract:  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) hosting disk water megamasers are well known to
be obscured by large amounts of gas, likely due to the presence along the line
of sight of an almost edge-on disky structure orbiting the supermassive black
hole. Correcting for the high obscuration is crucial to infer parameters
intrinsic to the source, like its luminosity. We present a broadband X-ray
spectral analysis of a water megamaser AGN in an early merger (NGC 5765B),
combining Chandra and NuSTAR data. NGC 5765B is highly Compton-thick and
reflection-dominated, following the general trend among disk megamasers.
Combining the exquisite black hole mass from masers with our X-ray
spectroscopy, the Eddington ratio of the megamaser is estimated to be in the
$2-14\%$ range, and its robustness is confirmed through SED fitting.

biomolecular building blocks (e.g., amino acids) are estimated to be on the

describe strategies for identifying extrasolar material and potentially

Title:The Kennicutt-Schmidt Law and Gas Scale Height in Luminous and Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies,"
Abstract:  A new analysis of high-resolution data from the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) for 5 luminous or ultra-luminous infrared
galaxies gives a slope for the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation equal to
$1.74^{+0.09}_{\rm -0.07}$ for gas surface densities $\Sigma_{\rm
mol}>10^3\;M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ and an assumed constant CO-to-H$_2$ conversion
factor. The velocity dispersion of the CO line, $\sigma_v$, scales
approximately as the inverse square root of $\Sigma_{\rm mol}$, making the
empirical gas scale height determined from $H\sim0.5\sigma^2/(\pi G\Sigma_{\rm
mol})$ nearly constant, 150-190 pc, over 1.5 orders of magnitude in
$\Sigma_{\rm mol}$. This constancy of $H$ implies that the average midplane
density, which is presumably dominated by CO-emitting gas for these extreme
star-forming galaxies, scales linearly with the gas surface density, which, in
turn, implies that the gas dynamical rate (the inverse of the free-fall time)
varies with $\Sigma_{\rm mol}^{1/2}$, thereby explaining most of the
super-linear slope in the KS relation. Consistent with these relations, we also
find that the mean efficiency of star formation per free-fall time is roughly
constant, 5%-7%, and the gas depletion time decreases at high $\Sigma_{\rm
mol}$, reaching only $\sim 16$ Myr at $\Sigma_{\rm mol}\sim10^4\;M_\odot$
pc$^{-2}$. The variation of $\sigma_v$ with $\Sigma_{\rm mol}$ and the
constancy of $H$ are in tension with some feedback-driven models, which predict
$\sigma_v$ to be more constant and $H$ to be more variable. However, these
results are consistent with simulations in which large-scale gravity drives
turbulence through a feedback process that maintains an approximately constant
Toomre $Q$ instability parameter.

Title:Circumbinary disk inner radius as a diagnostic for disk--binary misalignment,"
Abstract:  We investigate the misalignment of the circumbinary disk around the binary HD
98800 BaBb with eccentricity $e\simeq 0.8$. \cite{Kennedy2019} observed the
disk to be either at an inclination of $48^{\circ}$ or polar aligned to the
binary orbital plane. Their simulations showed that alignment from $48^\circ$
to a polar configuration can take place on a shorter timescale than the age of
this system. We perform hydrodynamical numerical simulations in order to
estimate the cavity size carved by the eccentric binary for different disk
inclinations as an independent check of polar alignment. Resonance theory
suggests that torques on the inner parts of a polar disk around such a highly
eccentric binary are much weaker than in the coplanar case, indicating a
significantly smaller central cavity than in the coplanar case. We show that
the inferred inner radius (from carbon monoxide measurements) of the accretion
disk around BaBb can exclude the possibility of it being mildly inclined with
respect to the binary orbital plane and therefore confirm the polar
configuration. This study constitutes an important diagnostic for misaligned
circumbinary disks, since it potentially allows us to infer the disk
inclination from observed gas disk inner radii.

Title:Do the planets in the HD 34445 system really exist?,"
Abstract:  In 2010 the first planet was discovered around star HD 34445. Recently,
another five planets were announced orbiting the same star. It is a rather
dense multi-planet system with some of its planets having separations of
fractions of an au and minimum masses ranging from Neptune to sub-Jupiter ones.
Given the number of planets and the various uncertainties in their masses and
orbital elements, the HD 34445 planetary system is quite interesting as there
is the potential for mean motion and secular resonances that could render the
outcome of its dynamical evolution and fate an open question. In this paper we
investigate the dynamical stability of the six planet system in order to check
the validity of the orbital solution acquired. This is achieved by a series of
numerical experiments, where the dynamical evolution of the system is tested on
different timescales. We vary the orbital elements and masses of the system
within the error ranges provided. We find that for a large area of the
parameter space we can produce stable configurations and therefore conclude it
is very likely that the HD 34445 planetary system is real. Some discussion
about the potential habitability of the system is also done.

"Title:The Composition and Mineralogy of Rocky Exoplanets: A Survey of >4,000 Stars from the Hypatia Catalog","
Abstract:  We present a survey of >4,000 star compositions from the Hypatia Catalog to
examine whether rocky exoplanets (i.e., those with rocky surfaces, dominated by
silicates) might be geologically similar to Earth, at least with respect to
composition and mineralogy. To do so, we explore the variety of reported
stellar compositions to then determine a possible range of exoplanetary mantle
mineralogies. We find that exoplanetary mantles will likely be dominated by
olivine and/or orthopyroxene, depending upon Fe partitioning during core
formation. Some exoplanets may be magnesiowustite- or quartz-saturated, and we
present a new classification scheme based on the weight $\%$ ratio
(FeO+MgO)/SiO$_{2}$, to differentiate rock types. But wholly exotic
mineralogies should be rare to absent. We find that half or more of the range
of exoplanet mantle mineralogy is controlled by core formation, which we model
using $\alpha_{Fe}$ = $Fe^{BSP}$/$Fe^{BP}$, where $Fe^{BSP}$ is Fe in a Bulk
Silicate Planet (bulk planet, minus core), on a cation weight $\%$ basis
(elemental weight proportions, absent anions) and $Fe^{BP}$ is the cation
weight $\%$ of Fe for a Bulk Planet. In our solar system, $\alpha_{Fe}$ varies
from 0 (Mercury) to about 0.54 (Mars). Remaining variations in exoplanet mantle
mineralogy result from non-trivial variations in star compositions. Our major
oxide analysis also verifies earlier, isotopic studies indicating that Earth is
non-solar (non-chondritic). We also find that major oxide estimates for Earth's
mantle appear to preclude a hidden component in the deep mantle that would
allow for a bulk solar/chondritic Earth. If it did exist, such a hidden
component must comprise at least 28% of the mass of the total mantle (to avoid
negative concentrations of some oxides) and would not look anything like the
sources of ocean island or mid-ocean ridge basalts.

Title:The Super Eight Galaxies: Properties of a Sample of Very Bright Galaxies at $7 < z < 8$,"
Abstract:  We present the Super Eight galaxies - a set of very luminous, high-redshift
($7.1<z<8.0$) galaxy candidates found in Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies
(BoRG) Survey fields. The original sample includes eight galaxies that are
$Y$-band dropout objects with $H$-band magnitudes of $m_H<25.5$. Four of these
objects were originally reported in Calvi et al. 2016. Combining new Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/F814W imaging and $Spitzer$ IRAC data with archival
imaging from BoRG and other surveys, we explore the properties of these
galaxies. Photometric redshift fitting places six of these galaxies in the
redshift range of $7.1<z<8.0$, resulting in three new high-redshift galaxies
and confirming three of the four high-redshift galaxy candidates from Calvi et
al. 2016. We calculate the half-light radii of the Super Eight galaxies using
the HST F160W filter and find that the Super Eight sizes are in line with
typical evolution of size with redshift. The Super Eights have a mean mass of
log(M$_*$/M$_\odot$) $\sim10$, which is typical for sources in this luminosity
range. Finally, we place our sample on the UV $z\sim8$ luminosity function and
find that the Super Eight number density is consistent with other surveys in
this magnitude and redshift range.

Title:The Breakthrough Listen Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,"
Abstract:  The discovery of the ubiquity of habitable extrasolar planets, combined with
revolutionary advances in instrumentation and observational capabilities, have
ushered in a renaissance in the millenia-old quest to answer our most profound
question about the Universe and our place within it - Are we alone? The
Breakthrough Listen Initiative, announced in July 2015 as a 10-year 100M USD
program, is the most comprehensive effort in history to quantify the
distribution of advanced, technologically capable life in the universe. In this
white paper, we outline the status of the on-going observing campaign with our
primary observing facilities, as well as planned activities with these
instruments over the next few years. We also list collaborative facilities
which will conduct searches for technosignatures in either primary observing
mode, or commensally. We highlight some of the novel analysis techniques we are
bringing to bear on multi-petabyte data sets, including machine learning tools
we are deploying to search for a broader range of technosignatures than was
previously possible.

Title:Exploring the innermost dust formation region of the oxygen-rich AGB star IK~Tau with VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL and VLTI/AMBER,"
Abstract:  Low- and intermediate-mass stars at the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) are
known to be prevalent dust providers to galaxies. However, the mechanisms
responsible for the formation and acceleration of dust in the cool extended
atmospheres of AGB stars are still open to debate. We present visible
polarimetric imaging observations of the oxygen-rich AGB star IK Tau obtained
with SPHERE-ZIMPOL (phase 0.27) as well as interferometric observations with
AMBER. IK Tau was observed with ZIMPOL at three wavelengths in the
pseudo-continuum (645, 748, and 820 nm), in the H$\alpha$ line at 656.3 nm, and
in the TiO band at 717 nm. The AMBER observations were carried out in the
wavelength region of the CO first overtone lines near 2.3 $\mu$m (R=12 000).
The polarimetric imaging capabilities of SPHERE-ZIMPOL have allowed us to
spatially resolve clumpy dust clouds at 20--50 mas from the central star, which
corresponds to 2--5 $R_{\star}$ when combined with a central star's angular
diameter of 20.7$\pm$1.53 mas measured with AMBER. The diffuse, asymmetric dust
emission extends out to $\sim$73 $R_{\star}$. We find that the TiO emission
extends to 150 mas (15 $R_{\star}$). The AMBER data in the CO lines also
suggest a molecular outer atmosphere extending to $\sim$1.5 $R_{\star}$. The
results of our 2-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer modelling of dust clumps
suggest that the polarized intensity and degree of linear polarization can be
reasonably explained by small-sized (0.1 $\mu$m) grains of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$,
MgSiO$_{3}$, or Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$ in an optically thin shell
($\tau_{550\mathrm{nm}}$=0.5$\pm$0.1) with an inner boundary radius of 3.5
$R_{\star}$. IK Tau's mass-loss rate is 20 to 50 times higher than the
previously studied AGB stars W Hya, R Dor, and $o$ Cet. Nevertheless, our
observations of IK Tau revealed that clumpy dust formation occurs close to the
star as seen in those low mass-rate AGB stars.

Title:Dynamics of multiple bodies in a corotation resonance: Conserved quantities and relevance to ring arcs,"
Abstract:  The interactions among objects in a mean motion resonance are important for
the orbital evolution of satellites and rings, especially Saturn's ring arcs
and associated moons. In this work, we examine interactions among massive
bodies in the same corotation eccentricity resonance site that affect the
orbital evolution of those bodies using numerical simulations. During these
simulations, the bodies exchange angular momentum and energy during close
encounters, altering their orbits. This energy exchange, however, does not mean
that one body necessarily moves closer to exact corotation when the other moves
away from it. Indeed, if one object moves towards one of these sites, the other
object is equally likely to move towards or away from it. This happens because
the timescale of these close encounters is short compared to the synodic period
between these particles and the secondary mass (i.e., the timescale where
corotation sites can be treated as potential maxima). Because the timescale of
a gravitational encounter is comparable to the timescale of a collision, we
could expect energy to be exchanged in a similar way for collisional
interactions. In that case, these findings could be relevant for denser systems
like the arcs in Neptune's Adams ring and how they can be maintained in the
face of frequent inelastic collisions.

Title:UVIT Open Cluster Study. I. Detection of a White Dwarf Companion to a Blue Straggler in M67: Evidence of Formation through Mass Transfer,"
Abstract:  The old open cluster M67, populated with blue straggler stars (BSSs), is a
well known test bed to study the BSS formation pathways. Here, we report the
first direct detection of a white dwarf (WD) companion to a BSS in M67, using
far-UV images from the \textit{Ultra Violet Imaging telescope} ({\it UVIT}) on
{\it ASTROSAT}. Near-simultaneous observations in three far-UV bands combined
with {\it GALEX}, {\it IUE}, ground and space based photometric data covering
0.14 -11.5 $\mu$m range for WOCS1007 were found to require a binary fit to its
spectral energy distribution (SED), consisting of a BSS and a hot companion. On
the other hand, a single spectral fit was found to be satisfactory for the SEDs
of two other BSSs, WOCS1006 and WOCS2011, with the latter showing a deficient
far-UV flux. The hot companion of WOCS1007 is found to have a T$_{eff}$ $\sim$
13250-13750K and a radius of 0.09$\pm$0.01 R$_\odot$. A comparison with WD
models suggests it to be a low mass WD ($\sim$ 0.18$M_\odot$), in agreement
with the kinematic mass from the literature. As a low mass WD ($<$
0.4$M_\odot$) necessitates formation through mass transfer (MT) in close
binaries, WOCS1007 with a known period of 4.2 days along with its fast
rotation, is likely to be formed by a case A or case B binary evolution.

Title:Relationship between the Metallicity of the Circumgalactic Medium and Galaxy Orientation,"
Abstract:  We investigate the geometric distribution of gas metallicities in the
circumgalactic medium (CGM) around $47$, $z<0.7$ galaxies from the ""Multiphase
Galaxy Halos"" Survey. Using a combination of quasar spectra from HST/COS and
from Keck/HIRES or VLT/UVES we measure column densities of, or determine limits
on, CGM absorption lines. We then use a Monte-Carlo Markov chain approach with
Cloudy to estimate the metallicity of cool (T$\sim$$10^4$K) CGM gas. We also
use HST images to determine host galaxy inclination and quasar--galaxy
azimuthal angles. Our sample spans a HI column density range of $13.8$ cm
s$^{-1}<{\log N_{HI}}<19.9$ cm s$^{-1}$. We find (1) while the metallicity
distribution appears bimodal, a Hartigan dip test cannot rule out a unimodal
distribution ($0.4\sigma$). (2) CGM metallicities are independent of halo mass,
spanning three orders of magnitude at fixed halo mass. (3) The CGM metallicity
does not depend on the galaxy azimuthal and inclination angles regardless of HI
column density, impact parameter and galaxy color. (4) Ionization parameter
does not depend on azimuthal angle. We suggest that the partial Lyman limit
metallicity bimodality is not driven by a spatial azimuthal bimodality. Our
results are consistent with simulations where the CGM is complex and
outflowing, accreting, and recycled gas are well-homogenized at $z<0.7$. The
presence of low metallicity gas at all orientations suggests that cold streams
of accreting filaments are not necessarily aligned with the galaxy plane at low
redshifts or intergalactic transfer may dominate. Finally, our results support
simulations showing that strong metal absorption can mask the presence of low
metallicity gas in integrated line-of-sight CGM metallicities.

Title:Evaporating primordial black holes as varying dark energy,"
Abstract:  If light enough primordial black holes (PBH) account for dark matter, then
its density decreases with time as they lose mass via Hawking radiation. We
show that this time-dependence of the matter density can be formulated as an
equivalent $w(z)$ dark energy model and we study its implications on the
expansion history. Using our approach and comparing with the latest
cosmological data, including the supernovae type Ia, Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background and the Hubble expansion H(z) data,
we place observational constraints on the PBH model. We find that it is
statistically consistent with $\Lambda$CDM according to the AIC statistical
tool. Furthermore, we entertain the idea of having a population of ultra-light
PBHs, decaying around neutrino decoupling, on top of the dark matter fluid and
show how this offers a natural dark matter-radiation coupling altering the
expansion history of the Universe and alleviating the $H_0$ tension.

Title:Characteristics of the two sequences seen in the high-velocity Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in Gaia DR2,"
Abstract:  In this study we use a sample of about 9 million SkyMapper stars with
metallicities to investigate the properties of the two stellar populations seen
in the high-velocity ($V_{\rm T} > 200$ km/s) Gaia DR2 Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram. Based on 10,000 red giant branch (RGB) stars (out of 75,000 with high
velocity), we find that the two sequences have different metallicity
distribution functions; one peaks at $-1.4$ dex (blue sequence) and the other
at $-0.7$ dex (red sequence). Isochrones with ages in the range $11$-$13.5$
Gyr, and metallicities chosen to match the observations for each sequence, fit
the turnoffs and broad RGBs well, indicating that the two populations formed at
comparable times within the uncertainties. We find that the mean tangential
velocity of disk stars increases steadily with decreasing metallicity, and that
the red sequence is made up of the high-velocity stars at the lowest
metallicities of the thick-disk population. Using relative number densities, we
further find that the red-sequence stars are more centrally concentrated in the
Galaxy, and we estimate the radial scale length of this population to be on the
order of $2$-$3$ kpc. The blue-sequence stars, on the other hand, follow a
nearly flat radial density profile. These findings tighten the link between the
red-sequence stars and the chemically defined thick disk.

XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation epochs with power-law and broken power-law
model. We have obtained change in spectral parameters before and after the
periastron passage for both models. The spectra get softened after the passage.
The evolution of the spectral index and break energy before and after the
periastron may indicate a change in the physical state of shock-accelerated
electrons.

Title:Simulating Radial Velocity Observations of Trappist-1 with SPIRou,"
Abstract:  We simulate a radial velocity (RV) follow-up of the TRAPPIST-1 system, a
faithful representative of M dwarfs hosting transiting Earth-sized exoplanets
to be observed with SPIRou in the months to come. We generate a RV curve
containing the signature of the 7 transiting TRAPPIST-1 planets and a realistic
stellar activity curve statistically compatible with the light curve obtained
with the K2 mission. We find a +/-5 m/s stellar activity signal comparable in
amplitude with the planet signal. Using various sampling schemes and white
noise levels, we create time-series from which we estimate the masses of the 7
planets. We find that the precision on the mass estimates is dominated by (i)
the white noise level for planets c, f and e and (ii) the stellar actvitity
signal for planets b, d and h. In particular, the activity signal completely
outshines the RV signatures of planets d and h that remain undetected
regardless of the RV curve sampling and level of white noise in the dataset. We
find that a RV follow-up of TRAPPIST-1 using SPIRou alone would likely result
in an insufficient coverage of the rapidly evolving activity signal of the
star, especially with bright-time observations only, making statistical methods
such as Gaussian Process Regression hardly capable of firmly detecting planet f
and accurately recovering the mass of planet g. In contrast, we show that using
bi-site observations with good longitudinal complementary would allow for a
more accurate filtering of the stellar activity RV signal.

inactive dM4 star which has been extensively observed. It hosts the fourth

theories in slow-rotating low-mass star. Methods. To characterize the magnetic
activity of Ross 128 we study the SK indexes derived from CASLEO, HARPS, FEROS,

periodograms, we analyze the whole SK time-series obtained between 2004 and

relation with the SK-index. Results. From both indexes, we obtain a possible
activity cycle with a 5-year period, which is one of a small handful of
activity cycles reported for a slow-rotating fully convective star.

Title:On the Origin of Dust in Galaxy Clusters at Low to Intermediate Redshift,"
Abstract:  Stacked analyses of galaxy clusters at low-to-intermediate redshift show
signatures attributable to dust, but the origin of this dust is uncertain. We
test the hypothesis that the bulk of cluster dust derives from galaxy ejecta.
To do so, we employ dust abundances obtained from detailed chemical evolution
models of galaxies. We integrate the dust abundances over cluster luminosity
functions (one-slope and two-slope Schechter functions). We consider both a
hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation and an independent evolution of the
three main galactic morphologies: elliptical/S0, spiral and irregular. We
separate the dust residing within galaxies from the dust ejected in the
intracluster medium. To the latter, we apply thermal sputtering. The model
results are compared to low-to-intermediate redshift observations of dust
masses. We find that in any of the considered scenarios, elliptical/S0 galaxies
contribute negligibly to the present-time intracluster dust, despite producing
the majority of gas-phase metals in galaxy clusters. Spiral galaxies, instead,
provide both the bulk of the spatially-unresolved dust and of the dust ejected
into the intracluster medium. The total dust-to-gas mass ratio in galaxy
clusters amounts to $10^{-4}$, while the intracluster medium dust-to-gas mass
ratio amounts to $10^{-6}$ at most. These dust abundances are consistent with
the estimates of cluster observations at $0.2 < z <1$. We propose that galactic
sources, spiral galaxies in particular, are the major contributors to the
cluster dust budget.

Abstract:  We present X-ray and radio monitoring observations of the gamma-ray binary

Chandra, XMM-Newton,NuSTAR X-ray observations and VLA radio observations of
this long orbit (50 years), 143 ms pulsar/Be star system clearly revealed flux
and spectral variability during the passage. The X-ray spectrum hardened near
periastron, with a significant decrease in the power-law photon index from
\Gamma ~ 2 to 1.2 and evidence of an increased absorption column density. We
identified a possible spectral break at a few keV in the spectrum that suggests
synchrotron cooling. A coincident radio and X-ray flare occurred one week after
periastron, which is possibly the result of the pulsar wind interacting with
the Be stellar disk and generating synchrotron radiation. However, a
multi-wavelength comparison indicate that the X-ray and radio spectra cannot be
simply connected by a single power-law component. Hence, the emission in these
two energy bands must originate from different particle populations.

Title:CosmicNet I: Physics-driven implementation of neural networks within Boltzmann-Einstein solvers,"
Abstract:  Einstein-Boltzmann Solvers (EBSs) are run on a massive scale by the cosmology
community when fitting cosmological models to data. We present a new concept
for speeding up such codes with neural networks. The originality of our
approach stems from not substituting the whole EBS by a machine learning
algorithm, but only its most problematic and least parallelizable step: the
integration of perturbation equations over time. This approach offers two
significant advantages: the task depends only on a subset of cosmological
parameters, and it is blind to the characteristics of the experiment for which
the output must be computed (for instance, redshift bins). These allow us to
construct a fast and highly re-usable network. In this proof-of-concept paper,
we focus on the prediction of CMB source functions, and design our networks
according to physical considerations and analytical approximations. This allows
us to reduce the depth and training time of the networks compared to a
brute-force approach. Indeed, the calculation of the source functions using the
networks is fast enough so that it is not a bottleneck in the EBS anymore.
Finally, we show that their accuracy is more than sufficient for accurate MCMC
parameter inference from Planck data. This paves the way for a new project,
CosmicNet, aimed at gradually extending the use and the range of validity of
neural networks within EBSs, and saving massive computational time in the
context of cosmological parameter extraction.

Title:Asymmetric Dark Matter Imprint on Low-mass Main-sequence Stars in the Milky Way Nuclear Star Cluster,"
Abstract:  In this work, we study the impact of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on low-mass
main-sequence stars in the Milky Way's nuclear star cluster, where the dark
matter (DM) density is expected to be orders of magnitude above what is found
near the Sun (${\rho }_{\mathrm{DM}}\gtrsim {10}^{3}\ \mathrm{GeV}\
{\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}$). Using a modified stellar evolution code and considering a
DM particle ($m_{\chi} = 4 \text{ GeV}$) with a spin-dependent interaction
cross section close to the limits allowed by direct detection, we found that
the interactions of ADM with baryons in the star's core can have two separate
effects on the evolution of these stars: a decrease in the hydrogen burning
rate, extending the duration of the main-sequence of stars with $M ~
1M_{\odot}$ by a few Gyr; the suppression of the onset of convection in the
core of stars with $M \lesssim 1.5M_{\odot}$ and consequent quench of supply
for the nuclear reactions. If we consider $\rho_{\text{DM}} > 10^3 \ \text{GeV
cm}^{-3}$ (corresponding to the inner 5 pc of the Milky Way), stars lighter
than the Sun will have a main-sequence life span comparable to the current age
of the universe. Stars heavier than two solar masses are not sensitive to the
DM particles considered here.

Abstract:  Metallicity gradients derived from planetary nebulae (PNe) using O, Ne, and

abundances were collected from the literature, carefully selecting a
homogeneous sample for each galaxy. Metallicity gradients shown by PNe are
flatter than those of HII regions in all cases. The extreme case is M31 where
PN abundances are not related to galactocentric distances and the gradients are
consistent with zero. To analyze the evolution of gradients with time we build
gradients for Peimbert Type I and non-Type I PNe finding that Type I PNe show
steeper gradients than non-Type I PNe and more similar to the ones of HII
regions indicating that the chemical gradients might steepen with time.
Alternatively, the flat gradients for old PNe show that radial migration could
have an important role in the evolution of galaxies.

Title:Concordance Cosmology?,"
Abstract:  We propose a new intuitive metric for evaluating the tension between two
experiments, and apply it to several data sets. While our metric is
non-optimal, if evidence of tension is detected, this evidence is robust and
easy to interpret. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, we find
that there is a modest $2.2\sigma$ tension between the DES Year 1 results and
the ${\it Planck}$ measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This
tension is driven by the difference between the amount of structure observed in
the late-time Universe and that predicted from fitting the ${\it Planck}$ data,
and appears to be unrelated to the tension between ${\it Planck}$ and local
esitmates of the Hubble rate. In particular, combining DES, Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations (BAO), Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and supernovae (SNe)
measurements recovers a Hubble constant and sound horizon consistent with ${\it
Planck}$, and in tension with local distance-ladder measurements. If the
tension between these various data sets persists, it is likely that reconciling
${\it all}$ current data will require breaking the flat $\Lambda$CDM model in
at least two different ways: one involving new physics in the early Universe,
and one involving new late-time Universe physics.

heed strict ethical and safety standards starting at the very beginning of a

crewed missions both in and beyond low-Earth orbit, it is essential to the
science community to agree on universal standards of safety, mission assurance,
planetary protection, and especially anti-colonization. These issues will
impact all areas of space science. Examples that are particularly relevant to

from satellites, the voices and rights of Native people when constructing

simple radio jet outflow. The predicted spectral energy distribution (SED) of
this model is compared to sub-arcsec resolution observations to get the best
estimates of the model parameters. The model-predicted radial emission profiles
at different frequency bands are used to predict whether the inflow can be
resolved by the EHT or with telescopes such as the Global 3-mm VLBI array

removal from the data of patterns which the neural nets could not `understand'.
The latter provides an often lacking mechanism to control and debias the

parametrization. We derive observational constraints on the model parameters by
using the data from cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO), the local value of Hubble constant from Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), and large scale structure (LSS) information from the abundance
of galaxy clusters, in four different combinations. We find that in the present
DM-photon coupling scenario the mean values of $w_{\rm de0}$ are in
quintessence region ($w_{\rm de0} > -1$) whereas they were in the phantom
region ($w_{\rm de0} < -1$) in our previous study with all data combinations.
The constraints on the DM-photon coupling parameter do not reflect any
significant deviation from the previous results. Due to the decay of DM into
photons, we obtain higher values of $H_0$, consistent with the local
measurements, similar to our previous study. But, the time-varying DE leads to
lower values of $\sigma_8$ in the DM-photon coupling model with all data
combinations, in comparison to the results in our previous study. Thus,
allowing time-varying DE in the DM-photon coupling scenario is useful to
alleviate the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions.

Title:The Carnegie Chicago Hubble Program VI: Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances to M66 and M96 of the Leo I Group,"
Abstract:  We determine the distances to the Type Ia Supernova host galaxies M66 (NGC
3627) and M96 (NGC 3368) of the Leo I Group using the Tip of the Red Giant
Branch (TRGB) method. We target the stellar halos of these galaxies using the
Hubble Space Telescope ACS/WFC in the F606W and F814W bandpasses. By pointing
to the stellar halos we sample RGB stars predominantly of Population II,
minimize host-galaxy reddening, and significantly reduce the effects of source
crowding. Our absolute calibration of the I-band TRGB is based on a recent
detached eclipsing binary distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. With this
geometric zero point in hand, we find for M66 and M96, respectively, true
distance moduli $ {\mu}_0 = 30.23 \pm 0.04\text{ (stat)} \pm 0.06\text{ (sys)}
$ mag and $ {\mu}_0 = 30.29 \pm 0.02\text{ (stat)} \pm 0.06\text{ (sys)} $ mag.

Title:On the Diversity of Fallback Rates from Tidal Disruption Events with Accurate Stellar Structure,"
Abstract:  The tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be used
to probe the SMBH mass function, the properties of individual stars, and
stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei. Upcoming missions will detect thousands of
TDEs, and accurate theoretical modeling is required to interpret the data with
precision. Here we analyze the influence of more realistic stellar structure on
the outcome of TDEs; in particular, we compare the fallback rates -- being the
rate at which tidally-disrupted debris returns to the black hole -- from
progenitors generated with the stellar evolution code {\sc mesa} to $\gamma =
4/3$ and $\gamma = 5/3$ polytropes. We find that {\sc mesa}-generated density
profiles yield qualitatively-different fallback rates as compared to polytropic
approximations, and that only the fallback curves from low-mass ($1M_{\odot}$
or less), zero-age main-sequence stars are well fit by either a $\gamma = 4/3$
or $5/3$ polytrope. Stellar age has a strong affect on the shape of the
fallback curve, and can produce characteristic timescales (e.g., the time to
the peak of the fallback rate) that greatly differ from the polytropic values.
We use these differences to assess the degree to which the inferred black hole
mass from the observed lightcurve can deviate from the true value, and find
that the discrepancy can be at the order of magnitude level. Accurate stellar
structure also leads to a substantial variation in the critical impact
parameter at which the star is fully disrupted, and can increase the
susceptibility of the debris stream to fragmentation under its own
self-gravity. These results suggest that detailed modeling is required to
accurately interpret observed lightcurves of TDEs.

Abstract:  Raman scattering enables unforeseen uses for the laser guide-star system of
the Very Large Telescope. Here, we present the observation of one up-link
sodium laser beam acquired with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at a resolution
$\lambda/\Delta\lambda \sim 140'000$. In 900s on-source, we detect the pure
rotational Raman lines of $^{16}$O$_2$, $^{14}$N$_2$, and $^{14}$N$^{15}$N
(tentatively) up to rotational quantum numbers $J$ of 27, 24, and 9,
respectively. We detect the $^{16}$O$_2$ fine-structure lines induced by the
interaction of the electronic spin \textbf{S} and end-over-end rotational
angular momentum \textbf{N} in the electronic ground state of this molecule up
to $N=9$. The same spectrum also reveals the $\nu_{1\leftarrow0}$
rotational-vibrational Q-branch for $^{16}$O$_2$ and $^{14}$N$_2$. These
observations demonstrate the potential of using laser guide-star systems as
accurate calibration sources for characterizing new astronomical spectrographs.

Title:X-ray Plateaus in Gamma Ray Bursts' light-curves from jets viewed slightly off-axis,"
Abstract:  Using multiple observational arguments, recent work has shown that
cosmological GRBs are typically viewed at angles within, or close to the cores
of their relativistic jets. One of those arguments relied on the lack of
tens-of-days-long periods of very shallow evolution that would be seen in the
afterglow light-curves of GRBs viewed at large angles. Motivated by these
results, we consider that GRBs efficiently produce $\gamma$-rays only within a
narrow region around the core. We show that, on these near-core lines-of-sight,
structured jets naturally produce shallow phases in the X-ray afterglow of
GRBs. These plateaus would be seen by a large fraction of observers and would
last between $10^2-10^5$ s. They naturally reproduce the observed distributions
of time-scales and luminosities as well as the inter-correlations between
plateau duration, plateau luminosity and prompt $\gamma$-ray energy. An
advantage of this interpretation is that it involves no late time energy
injection which would be both challenging from the point of view of the central
engine and, as we show here, less natural given the observed correlations
between plateau and prompt properties.

Title:Kinematical evolution of multiple stellar populations in star clusters,"
Abstract:  We present the results of a suite of \Nbody simulations aimed at
understanding the fundamental aspects of the long-term evolution of the
internal kinematics of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters. Our
models enable us to study the cooperative effects of internal,
relaxation-driven processes and external, tidally-induced perturbations on the
structural and kinematic properties of multiple-population globular clusters.
To analyse the dynamical behaviour of the multiple stellar populations in a
variety of spin-orbit coupling conditions, we have considered three reference
cases in which the tidally perturbed star cluster rotates along an axis
oriented in different directions with respect to the orbital angular momentum
vector. We focus specifically on the characterisation of the evolution of the
degree of differential rotation and anisotropy in the velocity space, and we
quantify the process of spatial and kinematic mixing of the two populations. In
light of recent and forthcoming explorations of the internal kinematics of this
class of stellar systems by means of line-of sight and astrometric
measurements, we also investigate the implications of projection effects and
spatial distribution of the stars adopted as tracers. The kinematic and
structural richness emerging from our models further emphasises the need and
the importance of observational studies aimed at building a complete
kinematical picture of the multiple population phenomenon.

Title:The CGM-GRB Study. I. Uncovering The CircumGalactic Medium around GRB hosts at redshifts 2-6,"
Abstract:  Recent studies have revealed a dynamic interplay between the galaxy ecosystem
and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We investigate the CGM at high redshifts
(z $\gtrsim$ 2) by using bright afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) as
background sources. We compiled a sample of medium-resolution ($\delta$v $<$ 50
km/s) and high signal-to-noise (typical SNR $\sim$ 10) spectra from 27 GRB
afterglows covering z $\sim$ 2 - 6, with six of them at z $\gtrsim$ 4. We
analyzed the high- and low-ionization absorption features within $\pm$400 km/s
to extract the CGM and ISM kinematics. In the stacked spectra, high-ionization
absorption profiles (e.g. C IV, Si IV) present significant absorption excess in
their blue wings (v $<$ -100 km/s) relative to the red wings (v $>$ 100 km/s).
The stronger blue wings in high-ionization species are indicative of the
presence of ubiquitous warm outflows in the GRB hosts at high redshifts. We
used simple toy models to kinematically distinguish the CGM and ISM absorption
and estimate the CGM mass and outflow velocity. We find tentative evidence of
the evolution of the CGM metal mass by $\sim$ 0.5 dex between two redshift
bins, each spanning 1 Gyr, z1: 2-2.7 and z2: 2.7-5. By comparing with past
studies, we find that over the course of evolution of present-day galaxies with
$M_{*} > 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, the ratio of C IV mass in the CGM to the stellar
mass remains fairly uniform, with $log(M_{CIV}/M_{*}) \sim -4.5$ within
$\pm$0.5 dex from z $\sim$ 4 to z $\sim$ 0, suggesting CGM-galaxy co-evolution.

Abstract:  Astrophotonics is the application of versatile photonic technologies to
channel, manipulate, and disperse guided light from one or more telescopes to
achieve scientific objectives in astronomy in an efficient and cost-effective
way. The developments and demands from the telecommunication industry have
driven a major boost in photonic technology and vice versa in the last 40
years. The photonic platform of guided light in fibers and waveguides has
opened the doors to next-generation instrumentation for both ground- and
space-based telescopes in optical and near/mid-IR bands, particularly for the
upcoming extremely large telescopes (ELTs). The large telescopes are pushing
the limits of adaptive optics to reach close to a near-diffraction-limited
performance. The photonic devices are ideally suited for capturing this
AO-corrected light and enabling new and exciting science such as characterizing
exoplanet atmospheres. The purpose of this white paper is to summarize the
current landscape of astrophotonic devices and their scientific impact,
highlight the key issues, and outline specific technological and organizational
approaches to address these issues in the coming decade and thereby enable new
discoveries as we embark on the era of extremely large telescopes.

Title:The Hubble PanCET program: An extensive search for metallic ions in the exosphere of GJ 436 b,"
Abstract:  (Abridged) The quiet M2.5 star GJ 436 hosts a warm Neptune that displays an
extended atmosphere that dwarfs its own host star. Predictions of atmospheric
escape in such planets state that H atoms escape from the upper atmosphere in a
collisional regime and that the flow can drag heavier atoms to the upper
atmosphere. It is unclear, however, what astrophysical mechanisms drive the
process. Our objective is to leverage the extensive coverage of HST/COS
observations of the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum of GJ 436 to search for
signals of metallic ions in the upper atmosphere of GJ 436 b. We analyzed flux
time-series of species present in the FUV spectrum of GJ 436, as well as the
Lyman-$\alpha$ line. GJ 436 displays FUV flaring events with a rate of $\sim$10
d$^{-1}$. There is evidence for a possibly long-lived active region or
longitude that modulates the FUV metallic lines of the star with amplitudes up
to 20%. Despite the strong geocoronal contamination in the COS spectra, we
detected in-transit excess absorption signals of $\sim$50% and $\sim$30% in the
blue and red wings, respectively, of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line. We rule out a
wide range of excess absorption levels in the metallic lines of the star during
the transit. The large atmospheric loss of GJ 436 b observed in Lyman-$\alpha$
transmission spectra is stable over the timescale of a few years, and the red
wing signal supports the presence of a variable hydrogen absorption source
besides the stable exosphere. The previously claimed in-transit absorption in
the Si III line is likely an artifact resulting from the stellar magnetic
cycle. The non-detection of metallic ions in absorption could indicate that the
escape is not hydrodynamic or that the atmospheric mixing is not efficient in
dragging metals high enough for sublimation to produce a detectable escape rate
of ions to the exosphere.

Title:Can Assembly Bias Explain the Lensing Amplitude of the BOSS CMASS Sample in a Planck Cosmology?,"
Abstract:  In this paper, we investigate whether galaxy assembly bias can reconcile the
20-40% disagreement between the observed galaxy projected clustering signal and
the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal in the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample reported in
Leauthaud et al. (2017). We use the suite of AbacusCosmos Lamda-CDM simulations
at Planck best-fit cosmology and two flexible implementations of extended halo
occupation distribution (HOD) models that incorporate galaxy assembly bias to
build forward models and produce joint fits of the observed galaxy clustering
signal and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal. We find that our models using the
standard HODs without any assembly bias generalizations continue to show a
20-40% over-prediction of the observed galaxy-galaxy lensing signal. We find
that our implementations of galaxy assembly bias do not reconcile the two
measurements at Planck best-fit cosmology. In fact, despite incorporating
galaxy assembly bias, the satellite distribution parameter, and the satellite
velocity bias parameter into our extended HOD model, our fits still strongly
suggest a 31-34% discrepancy between the observed projected clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. It remains to be seen whether a combination
of other galaxy assembly bias models, alternative cosmological parameters, or
baryonic effects can explain the amplitude difference between the two signals.

Title:The Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program. VIII. An Independent Determination of the Hubble Constant Based on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch,"
Abstract:  We present a new and independent determination of the local value of the
Hubble constant based on a calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch
(TRGB) applied to Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). We find a value of Ho = 69.8 +/-
0.8 (+/-1.1\% stat) +/- 1.7 (+/-2.4\% sys) km/sec/Mpc. The TRGB method is both
precise and accurate, and is parallel to, but independent of the Cepheid
distance scale. Our value sits midway in the range defined by the current
Hubble tension. It agrees at the 1.2-sigma level with that of the Planck 2018
estimate, and at the 1.7-sigma level with the SHoES measurement of Ho based on
the Cepheid distance scale. The TRGB distances have been measured using deep
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imaging of
galaxy halos. The zero point of the TRGB calibration is set with a distance
modulus to the Large Magellanic Cloud of 18.477 +/- 0.004 (stat) +/-0.020 (sys)
mag, based on measurement of 20 late-type detached eclipsing binary (DEB)
stars, combined with an HST parallax calibration of a 3.6 micron Cepheid
Leavitt law based on Spitzer observations. We anchor the TRGB distances to
galaxies that extend our measurement into the Hubble flow using the recently
completed Carnegie Supernova Project I sample containing about 100
well-observed SNeIa. There are several advantages of halo TRGB distance
measurements relative to Cepheid variables: these include low halo reddening,
minimal effects of crowding or blending of the photometry, only a shallow
(calibrated) sensitivity to metallicity in the I-band, and no need for multiple
epochs of observations or concerns of different slopes with period. In
addition, the host masses of our TRGB host-galaxy sample are higher on average
than the Cepheid sample, better matching the range of host-galaxy masses in the
CSP distant sample, and reducing potential systematic effects in the SNeIa
measurements.

Title:Elemental abundances in the remnant of the ancient eruption of CK Vulpeculae,"
Abstract:  CK Vul or Nova 1670 is an enigmatic eruptive object which underwent a
stellar-merger event recorded by seventeenth-century observers. Its remnant was
recently recovered at submillimeter wavelengths, revealing gas of an
extraordinary isotopic composition indicative of past processing in the CNO
cycles and partial He burning. Here, we present long-slit optical spectra of
the remnant acquired with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope at an
unprecedented sensitivity and spectral coverage. The spectra cover features of
key elements - including H, He, C, N, and O - at ionization degrees I-III. A
classical analysis of the spectra allows us to identify several
spatio-kinematic components in the probed part of the nebula at electron
temperatures of 10-15 kK and densities of 200-600 cm$^{-3}$. We find that the
nebula is most likely excited by shocks rather than by direct radiation of the
stellar remnant. We provide a detailed analysis of the elemental abundances in
the remnant and find that helium is twice more abundant than in the Sun.
Nitrogen is also overabundant with a N/O ratio ten times larger than the solar
one. These anomalous abundances strongly indicate that the observed gas was
processed in CNO cycles of H burning, consistent with the submillimeter
studies. Additionally, sub-solar abundances of heavier elements, such as Ne, S,
and Ar, suggest that the progenitor of CK Vul was formed from material poorer
in metals than the Sun and was therefore an old stellar system before the 1670
eruption.

Title:An extensive-air-shower-like event registered with the TUS orbital detector,"
Abstract:  TUS (Tracking Ultraviolet Set-up) is the world's first orbital detector of
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). It was launched into orbit on 28th
April 2016 as a part of the scientific payload of the Lomonosov satellite. The
main aim of the mission was to test the technique of measuring the ultraviolet
fluorescence and Cherenkov radiation of extensive air showers generated by
primary cosmic rays with energies above ~100 EeV in the Earth atmosphere from
space. During its operation for 1.5 years, TUS registered almost 80,000 events
with a few of them satisfying conditions anticipated for extensive air showers
(EASs) initiated by UHECRs. Here we discuss an event registered on 3rd October
2016. The event was measured in perfect observation conditions as an
ultraviolet track in the nocturnal atmosphere of the Earth, with the kinematics
and the light curve similar to those expected from an EAS. A reconstruction of
parameters of a primary particle gave the zenith angle around 44$^\circ$ but an
extreme energy not compatible with the cosmic ray energy spectrum obtained with
ground-based experiments. We discuss in details all conditions of registering
the event, explain the reconstruction procedure and its limitations and comment
on possible sources of the signal, both of anthropogenic and astrophysical
origin. We believe this detection represents a significant milestone in the
space-based observation of UHECRs because it proves the capability of an
orbital telescope to detect light signals with the apparent motion and light
shape similar to what are expected from EASs. This is important for the
on-going development of the future missions KLYPVE-EUSO and POEMMA, aimed for

Title:Overcoming the structural surface effect with a realistic treatment of turbulent convection in 1D stellar models,"
Abstract:  State-of-the-art one-dimensional (1D) stellar evolution codes rely on
simplifying assumptions, such as mixing length theory, in order to describe
superadiabatic convection. As a result, 1D stellar structure models do not
correctly recover the surface layers of the Sun and other stars with convective
envelopes. We present a method that overcomes this structural drawback by
employing three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations of stellar envelopes:
at every time-step of the evolution interpolated 3D envelopes are appended to
the 1D structure and are used to supply realistic boundary conditions for the
stellar interior. In contrast to previous attempts, our method includes mean 3D
turbulent pressure. We apply our method to model the present Sun. The
structural shortcomings of standard stellar models lead to systematic errors in
the stellar oscillation frequencies inferred from the model. We show that our
method fully corrects for this error. Furthermore, we show that our realistic
treatment of superadiabatic convection alters the predicted evolution of the
Sun. Our results hence have important implications for the characterization of
stars. This has ramifications for neighbouring fields, such as exoplanet
research and galactic archaeology, for which accurate stellar models play a key
role.

Title:Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission at TeV energy,"
Abstract:  Measuring the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray flux in the TeV range is difficult
for ground-based gamma-ray telescopes because of the residual cosmic-ray
background, which is higher than the gamma-ray flux by several orders of
magnitude. Its detection is also challenging for space-based telescopes because
of low signal statistics. We characterize the diffuse TeV flux from the Galaxy
using decade-long exposures of the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Considering that
the level of diffuse Galactic emission in the TeV band approaches the level of
residual cosmic-ray background, we estimated the level of residual cosmic-ray
background in the SOURCEVETO event selection and verified that the TeV diffuse
Galactic emission flux is well above the residual cosmic-ray background up to
high Galactic latitude regions. We study spectral and imaging properties of the
diffuse TeV signal from the Galactic plane. We find much stronger emission from
the inner Galactic plane than in previous HESS telescope estimates (lower
bound). We also find a significant difference in the measurement of the
Galactic longitude and latitude profiles of the signal measured by Fermi and
HESS. These discrepancies are presumably explained by the fact that regions of
background estimate in HESS have non-negligible gamma-ray flux. Comparing Fermi
measurements with those of ARGO-YBJ, we find better agreement, with the notable
exception of the Cygnus region, where we find much higher flux (by a factor
1.5). We also measure the TeV diffuse emission spectrum up to high Galactic
latitude and show that the spectra of different regions of the sky have
spectral slopes consistent with Gamma=2.34+/- 0.04. We discuss the possible
origin of the hard slope of the TeV diffuse emission. Fermi/LAT provides
reliable measurements of the diffuse Galactic emission spectrum in the TeV
range.

reheating is completely realized and the thermalization is attained. By

Title:Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion in Supergiant X-ray binaries: stability and disk formation,"
Abstract:  We use 2D (axisymmetric) and 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion with and without transverse upstream
gradients. We mainly focus on the regime of high (upstream) Mach number, weak
upstream gradients and small accretor size, which is relevant to neutron star
(NS) accretion in wind-fed Supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXBs). We present a
systematic exploration of the flow in this regime. When there are no upstream
gradients, the flow is always stable regardless of accretor size or Mach
number. For finite upstream gradients, there are three main types of behavior:
stable flow (small upstream gradient), turbulent unstable flow without a disk
(intermediate upstream gradient), and turbulent flow with a disk-like structure
(relatively large upstream gradient). When the accretion flow is turbulent, the
accretion rate decreases non-convergently as the accretor size decreases. The
flow is more prone to instability and the disk is less likely to form than
previously expected; the parameters of most observed SgXBs place them in the
regime of a turbulent, disk-less accretion flow. Among the SgXBs with
relatively well-determined parameters, we find OAO 1657-415 to be the only one

Title:Formation and delivery of complex organic molecules to the Solar System and early Earth,"
Abstract:  The late stages of stellar evolution from asymptotic giant branch stars to
planetary nebulae are now known to be an active phase of molecular synthesis.
Over 80 gas-phase molecules have been detected through rotational transitions
in the mm/submm region. Infrared spectroscopy has also detected inorganic
minerals, fullerenes, and organic solids. The synthesis of these molecules and
solids take place over very low density ($<10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) and short
($\sim10^3$ yr) time scales. The complex organics are observed to have mixed
aromatic/aliphatic structures and may be related to the complex organics found
in meteorites, comets, interplanetary dust particles, and planetary satellites.
The possible links between stellar and solar system organics is discussed.

Title:Shock fronts in the long GRB031203 host galaxy,"
Abstract:  The detailed modelling of the spectra observed from the long GRB031203 host
galaxy at different epochs during the 2003-2009 years is presented. The line
profiles show FWHM of about 100 km/s. A broad line profile with FWHM < 400 km/s
appears in the line sockets from the 2009 observations. We suggest that the
narrow lines show the velocity of star-burst (SB) debris, while the broad ones
are due to the wind from SB stars. The spectra are emitted from the gas
downstream of different shock fronts which are at work on the edges of the
emitting clouds. A head-on-back shock appears when the wind from the SB stars
reaches the internal edge of the SB debris moving outwards. A head-on shock is
created by collision of the debris with the ISM clouds.Line ratios in both
cases are calculated by the coupled effect of shock and photoionization from
the SB. The models selected by fitting the calculated to the observed line
ratios show that the ionization parameters, the shock velocities and the gas
pre-shock densities slowly decrease with time.Oxygen metallicities
(12+log(O/H)=8.3-8.48) are lower than solar (8.82) by a factor <3 and nitrogen
metallicities are lower than solar (12+log(N/H)=8.0) by factors of 3-5.

Title:Metadata Extraction from Raw Astroparticle Data of TAIGA Experiment,"
Abstract:  Today, the operating TAIGA (Tunka Advanced Instrument for cosmic rays and
Gamma Astronomy) experiment continuously produces and accumulates a large
volume of raw astroparticle data. To be available for the scientific community
these data should be well-described and formally characterized. The use of
metadata makes it possible to search for and to aggregate digital objects (e.g.
events and runs) by time and equipment through a unified interface to access
them. The important part of the metadata is hidden and scattered in
folder/files names and package headers. Such metadata should be extracted from
binary files, transformed to a unified form of digital objects, and loaded into
the catalog. To address this challenge we developed a concept of the metadata
extractor that can be extended by facility-specific extraction modules. It is
designed to automatically collect descriptive metadata from raw data files of
all TAIGA formats.

Title:The Galactic magnetic field in the light of starburst-generated ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays,"
Abstract:  Auger data show evidence for a correlation between ultrahigh-energy cosmic
rays (UHECRs) and nearby starburst galaxies. This intriguing correlation is
consistent with data collected by the Telescope Array, which have revealed a
much more pronounced directional ``hot spot'' in arrival directions not far
from the starburst galaxy M82. In this work, we assume starbursts are sources
of UHECRs and investigate the prospects to use the observed distribution of
UHECR arrival directions to constrain Galactic magnetic field models. We show
that if the Telescope Array hot spot indeed originates from M82, UHECR data
would place a strong constraint on the coherent and turbulent components of the
Galactic magnetic field.

Title:Dust destruction in non-radiative shocks,"
Abstract:  Supernova remnant (SNR) shock waves are the main place where interstellar
dust grains are destroyed. However, the dust destruction efficiency in
non-radiative shocks is still not well known. One way to estimate the fraction
of dust destroyed is to compare the difference between postshock gas abundances
and preshock medium total abundances when the preshock elemental depletion
factors are known. We compare the postshock gas abundances of 16 SNRs in Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the LMC interstellar medium abundances that we
derived based on 69 slow-rotating early B-type stars. We find that, on average,
$\sim$61\% of Si rich dust grains are destroyed in the shock while the fraction
of dust destroyed is only $\sim$40\% for Fe rich dust grains. This result
supports the idea that the high depletion of Fe in the diffuse neutral medium
is not caused by the resilience of Fe rich grains but because of faster growth
rate. This work also presents a potential way to constrain the chemical
composition of interstellar dust.

Title:Quartic inflation and radiative corrections with non-minimal coupling,"
Abstract:  It is well known that the non-minimal coupling $\xi\phi^2R$ between the
inflaton and the Ricci scalar affects predictions of single field inflation
models. In particular, the $\lambda\phi^4$ quartic inflation potential with
$\xi\gtrsim0.005$ is one of the simplest models that agree with the current
data. After reviewing the inflationary predictions of this potential, we
analyze the effects of the radiative corrections due to couplings of the
inflaton to other scalar fields or fermions. Using two different prescriptions
discussed in the literature, we calculate the range of these coupling parameter
values for which the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$
are in agreement with the data taken by the Keck Array/BICEP2 and Planck
collaborations.

Title:Robust Archives Maximize Scientific Accessibility,"
Abstract:  We present a bibliographic analysis of Chandra, Hubble, and Spitzer
publications. We find (a) archival data are used in >60% of the publication
output and (b) archives for these missions enable a much broader set of
institutions and countries to scientifically use data from these missions.
Specifically, we find that authors from institutions that have published few
papers from a given mission publish 2/3 archival publications, while those with
many publications typically have 1/3 archival publications. We also show that
countries with lower GDP per capita overwhelmingly produce archival
publications, while countries with higher GDP per capital produce guest
observer and archival publications in equal amounts. We argue that robust
archives are thus not only critical for the scientific productivity of mission
data, but also the scientific accessibility of mission data. We argue that the
astronomical community should support archives to maximize the overall
scientific societal impact of astronomy, and represent an excellent investment
in astronomy's future.

Abstract:  We report results of the spectral and timing analysis of the Be/X-ray pulsar
SXP 4.78 using the data obtained during its recent outburst with NuSTAR, Swift,
Chandra and NICER observatories. Using an overall evolution of the system
luminosity, spectral analysis and variability power spectrum we obtain
constraints on the neutron star magnetic field strength. We found a rapid
evolution of the variability power spectrum during the rise of the outburst,
and absence of the significant changes during the flux decay. Several low
frequency quasi-periodic oscillation features are found to emerge on the
different stages of the outburst, but no clear clues on their origin were found
in the energy spectrum and overall flux behaviour. We use several indirect
methods to estimate the magnetic field strength on the neutron star surface and
found that most of them suggest magnetic field $B \lesssim 2 \times10^{12}$ G.
The strictest upper limit comes from the absence of the cyclotron absorption
features in the energy spectra and suggests relatively weak magnetic field $B <
6 \times 10^{11}$ G.

Title:Extending light WIMP searches to single scintillation photons in LUX,"
Abstract:  We present a novel analysis technique for liquid xenon time projection
chambers that allows for a lower threshold by relying on events with a prompt
scintillation signal consisting of single detected photons. The energy
threshold of the LUX dark matter experiment is primarily determined by the
smallest scintillation response detectable, which previously required a 2-fold
coincidence signal in its photomultiplier arrays, enforced in data analysis.
The technique presented here exploits the double photoelectron emission effect
observed in some photomultiplier models at vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths. We
demonstrate this analysis using an electron recoil calibration dataset and
place new constraints on the spin-independent scattering cross section of
weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) down to 2.5 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass
using the 2013 LUX dataset. This new technique is promising to enhance light
WIMP and astrophysical neutrino searches in next-generation liquid xenon

Abstract:  We describe our nonlinear emulation (i.e., interpolation) framework that
combines the halo occupation distribution (HOD) galaxy bias model with $N$-body
simulations of nonlinear structure formation, designed to accurately predict
the projected clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing signals from luminous red
galaxies (LRGs) in the redshift range $0.16 < z < 0.36$ on comoving scales $0.6
< r_p < 30$ \hMpc. The interpolation accuracy is $\lesssim 1-2$ per cent across
the entire physically plausible range of parameters for all scales considered.
We correctly recover the true value of the cosmological parameter $S_8 =
({\sigma_8}/{0.8228}) ({\Omega_{\text{m}}}/{0.3107})^{0.6}$ from mock
measurements produced via subhalo abundance matching (SHAM)-based lightcones
designed to approximately match the properties of the SDSS LOWZ galaxy sample.

measurements made with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 (DR8)

measurement of $S_8 = 0.847 \pm 0.037$, in $3.5\sigma$ tension with the Planck
cosmological results of $1.00 \pm 0.02$. We discuss the possibility of

one of the last globular cluster white dwarf (WD) cooling sequences accessible

show that we have reached the peak of the luminosity function of the WD cooling

age of ~14Gyr. This age is also consistent with the age from fits to the
main-sequence turnoff (13-14Gyr), reinforcing our conclusion that we observe
the expected accumulation of white dwarfs along the cooling sequence.

Title:Assessing the photometric redshift precision of the S-PLUS survey: the Stripe-82 as a test-case,"
Abstract:  In this paper we present a thorough discussion about the photometric redshift
(photo-z) performance of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey
(S-PLUS). This survey combines a 7 narrow + 5 broad passband filter system,
with a typical photometric-depth of r$\sim$21 AB. For this exercise, we utilize
the Data Release 1 (DR1), corresponding to 336 deg$^{2}$ from the Stripe-82
region. We rely on the \texttt{BPZ2} code to compute our estimates, using a new
library of SED models, which includes additional templates for quiescent
galaxies. When compared to a spectroscopic redshift control sample of
$\sim$100k galaxies, we find a precision of $\sigma_{z}<$0.8\%, $<$2.0\% or
$<$3.0\% for galaxies with magnitudes r$<$17, $<$19 and $<$21, respectively. A
precision of 0.6\% is attained for galaxies with the highest \texttt{Odds}
values. These estimates have a negligible bias and a fraction of catastrophic
outliers inferior to 1\%. We identify a redshift window (i.e., 0.26$<z<$0.32)
where our estimates double their precision, due to the simultaneous detection
of two emission-lines in two distinct narrow-bands; representing a window
opportunity to conduct statistical studies such as luminosity functions. We
forecast a total of $\sim$2M, $\sim$16M and $\sim$32M galaxies in the S-PLUS
survey with a photo-z precision of $\sigma_{z}<$1.0\%, $<$2.0\% and $<$2.5\%
after observing 8000 $deg^{2}$. We also derive redshift Probability Density
Functions, proving their reliability encoding redshift uncertainties and their
potential recovering the $n(z)$ of galaxies at $z<0.4$, with an unprecedented

Abstract:  Base on about 4,500 large tangential velocity

$5\sigma$ parallaxes in Gaia DR2 5D information derived from parallax and
proper motion, we identify more than 600 high velocity stars with $50\%$
unbound probability. Of these, 28 nearby (less than 6 kpc) late-type
Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) with over $99\%$ possibility of unbound are
discovered. In order to search for the unbound stars from the full Gaia DR2 6D
phase space information derived from parallax, proper motion and radial
velocity, we also identify 28 stars from the total velocity
($V_\mathrm{gc}>0.75V_\mathrm{esc}$) that have probabilities greater than
$50\%$ of being unbound from the Galaxy. Of these, only three have a nearly
$99\%$ probabilities of being unbound. On the whole HVSs subsample, there is 12
sources reported by other surveys. We study the spatial distribution of angular
positions and angular separation of HVSs. We find the unbound HVSs are
spatially anisotropic that is most significant in the Galactic longitude at
more than $3\sigma$ level, and lower unbound probability HVSs are
systematically more isotropic. The spatial distribution can reflect the origin
of HVSs and we discuss the possible origin link with the anisotropy.

Title:Quasi-static contraction during runaway gas accretion onto giant planets,"
Abstract:  Gas-giant planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, acquire massive gaseous envelopes
during the approximately 3 Myr-long lifetimes of protoplanetary discs. In the
core accretion scenario, the formation of a solid core of around 10 Earth
masses triggers a phase of rapid gas accretion. Previous 3D grid-based
hydrodynamical simulations found runaway gas accretion rates corresponding to
approximately 10 to 100 Jupiter masses per Myr. Such high accretion rates would
result in all planets with larger-than-10-Earth-mass cores forming Jupiter-like
planets, in clear contrast to the ice giants in the Solar System and the
observed exoplanet population. In this work, we use 3D hydrodynamical
simulations, that include radiative transfer, to model the growth of the
envelope on planets with different masses. We find that gas flows rapidly
through the outer part of the envelope, but this flow does not drive accretion.
Instead, gas accretion is the result of quasi-static contraction of the inner
envelope, which can be orders of magnitude smaller than the mass flow through
the outer atmosphere. For planets smaller than Saturn, we measure moderate gas
accretion rates that are below 1 Jupiter mass per Myr. Higher mass planets,
however, accrete up to 10 times faster and do not reveal a self-driven
mechanism that can halt gas accretion. Therefore, the reason for the final
masses of Saturn and Jupiter remains difficult to understand, unless their
completion coincided with the dissipation of the Solar Nebula.

Abstract:  We perform an extensive analysis of optical counterparts of Planck PSZ2

AMF DR9, redMaPPer (v6.3) and Wen et al (WHL). We significantly extend the
number of optical counterparts of detected Planck clusters, and characterize
the optical properties when multiple identifications in different catalogs
exist. For Planck clusters which already possess an external validation, we
analyze the redshift assignment for both optical and X--ray determinations. We
then analyze the Planck Cosmology sample and comment on redshift determination
and potential mass mis-determinations due to alignment issues. Finally, we
inspect the reconstructed $y$ map from Planck and reason on the detectability
of optical clusters. Overall, AMF DR9 main (extended) finds 485 (511) optical
matches, with 45 (55) previously unmatched PSZ2 clusters, to be compared with
the 374 optical matches already present in PSZ2. 29 of the 55 previously
unmatched clusters do not yet have a followup in the literature. 18 of these
are found in more than one SDSS catalog with consistent redshifts. We provide
redshift and mass estimates for the newly matched clusters, and discuss the
comparison with the follow-ups, when present. We find good agreement between
the redMaPPer and AMF DR9 redshift determinations. From the Planck Cosmology
sample, we find 14 clusters which merit further investigation, and discuss
possible alignment issues for 9 of these clusters. After inspecting the $y$
map, we provide a list of 229 optical clusters not included in the Planck PSZ2
catalog but showing a prominent $y$ signal. We have further investigated the 86

Title:Magnetic helicity and eruptivity in active region 12673,"
Abstract:  Context. In September 2017 the largest X-class flare of Solar Cycle 24
occurred from the most active region (AR) of this cycle, AR 12673. The AR
attracted much interest because of its unique morphological and evolution
characteristics. Among the parameters examined in the AR was magnetic helicity,
but either only approximately, and/or intermittently. Aims. This work is
interested in studying the evolution of the relative magnetic helicity and of
the two components of its decomposition, the non-potential, and the
volume-threading one, in the time interval around the highest activity of AR
12673. Special emphasis is given on the study of the ratio of the non-potential
to total helicity, that was recently proposed as an indicator of ARs
eruptivity. Methods. For these, we first approximate the coronal magnetic field
of the AR with two different optimization-based extrapolation procedures, and
choose the one that produces the most reliable helicity value at each instant.
Moreover, in one of these methods, we weight the optimization by the
uncertainty estimates derived from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
instrument, for the first time. We then follow an accurate method to compute
all quantities of interest. Results. The first observational determination of
the evolution of the non-potential to total helicity ratio seems to confirm the
quality it has in indicating eruptivity. This ratio increases before the major
flares of AR 12673, and afterwards it relaxes to smaller values. Additionally,
the evolution patterns of the various helicity, and energy budgets of AR 12673
are discussed and compared with other works.

Abstract:  We present an ultra-violet (UV) study of the galaxy NGC~300 using GALEX
far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) observations. We studied the nature of UV
emission in the galaxy and correlated it with optical, H~I and mid-infrared
(3.6 $\mu$m) wavelengths. Our study identified extended features in the outer
disk, with the UV disk extending up to radius 12 kpc ($>$2R$_{25})$. We
estimated the FUV and NUV disk scale-length as 3.05$\pm$0.27 kpc and
2.66$\pm$0.20 kpc respectively. The scale-length in FUV is 2.3 times larger
than that at 3.6 $\mu$m, and we also find the disk to gradually become flatter
from longer to shorter wavelengths. We performed a statistical source
subtraction to eliminate the background contaminants and identified 261
unresolved UV sources between the radii 5.3 kpc and 10 kpc (1 $\sim$ 2
R$_{25}$). The identified UV sources show an age range between 1 - 300 Myr with
a peak at 25 Myr and a mass range between $10^3 M_{\odot}$ to $10^6 M_{\odot}$,
estimated using starburst99 models. The north-eastern spiral arm is found to be
populated by young low mass sources suggesting that the star formation in this
spiral arm is a recent phenomenon. The UV emission beyond the R$_{25}$ radius
has contribution from these low mass sources and is extended up to $\sim$
2R$_{25}$ radius. We conclude that NGC~300 has an extended UV disk, mainly
populated by young low mass sources. The star formation rate is measured to be
$\sim$0.46 $M_{\odot}/yr$ which is comparable to its near optical twin M33.

Title:The initial mass-final luminosity relation of type II supernova progenitors. Hints of new physics?,"
Abstract:  We revise the theoretical initial mass-final luminosity relation for
progenitors of type IIP and IIL supernovae. The effects of the major
uncertainties, as those due to the treatment of convection, semiconvection,
rotation, mass loss, nuclear reaction rates and neutrinos production rates are
discussed in some details. The effects of mass transfer between components of
close-binary systems are also considered. By comparing the theoretical
predictions to a sample of type II supernovae for which the initial mass of the
progenitors and the pre-explosive luminosity are available, we conclude that
stellar rotation may explain a few progenitors which appear brighter than
expected in case of non-rotating models. In the most extreme case, SN2012ec, an
initial rotational velocity up to 300 km s$^{-1}$ is required. Alternatively,
these objects could be mass-loosing components of close binaries. However, most
of the observed progenitors appear fainter than expected. This occurrence seems
to indicate that the Compton and pair neutrino energy-loss rates, as predicted
by the standard electro-weak theory, are not efficient enough and that an
additional negative contribution to the stellar energy balance is required. We
show that axions coupled with parameters accessible to currently planned
experiments, such as IAXO and, possibly, Baby-IAXO and ALPS II, may account for
the missing contribution to the stellar energy-loss.

Title:Pulsar Timing Array Constraints on the Induced Gravitational Waves,"
Abstract:  If the black holes detected by LIGO/VIRGO are primordial black holes (PBHs)
sourcing from a large primordial curvature perturbation on small scales, the
corresponding induced gravitational waves (GWs) would peak at nanohertz that is
detectable by the current and future observations of pulsar timing array (PTA).
In this paper we show that with the mass function estimated from the merger
rate of LIGO O1 and O2 events, the induced GWs from such a curvature
perturbation with a Gaussian narrow peak at some small scale would be in a
seemingly mild tension with current constraints from PTA. However, if the
curvature perturbation is of local-type non-Gaussianity with a non-linear
parameter $f_\text{NL}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10)$, the tension could be relieved.
Nevertheless, such an induced GWs must be detectable by the Square Kilometer
Array in a decade or less.

Title:PG 1610$+$062: a runaway B star challenging classical ejection mechanisms,"
Abstract:  Hypervelocity stars are rare objects, mostly main-sequence (MS) B stars,
traveling so fast that they will eventually escape from the Milky Way.
Recently, it has been shown that the popular Hills mechanism, in which a binary
system is disrupted via a close encounter with the supermassive black hole at
the Galactic center, may not be their only ejection mechanism. The analyses of
Gaia data ruled out a Galactic center origin for some of them, and instead
indicated that they are extreme disk runaway stars ejected at velocities
exceeding the predicted limits of classical scenarios (dynamical ejection from
star clusters or binary supernova ejection). We present the discovery of a new
extreme disk runaway star, PG 1610$+$062, which is a slowly pulsating B star
bright enough to be studied in detail. A quantitative analysis of spectra taken
with ESI at the Keck Observatory revealed that PG 1610$+$062 is a late B-type
MS star of 4-5 $M_\odot$ with low projected rotational velocity. Abundances (C,
N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe) were derived differentially with respect
to the normal B star HD 137366 and indicate that PG 1610$+$062 is somewhat
metal rich. A kinematic analysis, based on our spectrophotometric distance
(17.3 kpc) and on proper motions from Gaia's second data release, shows that PG
1610$+$062 was probably ejected from the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm at a
velocity of $550\pm40$ km s$^{-1}$, which is beyond the classical limits.
Accordingly, the star is in the top five of the most extreme MS disk runaway
stars and is only the second among the five for which the chemical composition
is known.

mass of ~10Msun (d=1.7 kpc) or ~18Msun (d=3 kpc), assuming Keplerian rotation.
Our data also unveil a fast (~100 km/s) bipolar ejection (a jet?) orthogonal to
the disk. In addition, a slow (<15km/s) wind may be lifting off the disk. Both,
the slow and the fast winds are found to be rotating in a similar manner to the
ionized layers of the disk. This represents the first empirical proof of
rotation in a bipolar wind expanding at high velocity (~100 km/s). (abridged)

Title:Resonance line in rotating accretion disc,"
Abstract:  We study the resonance line emission from the rotating plane optically thick
accretion disc, consisting of free electrons and resonant atoms. We use the
standard assumption that the source of continuum radiation is located near
central plane of the accretion disc, where the temperature is the highest. This
corresponds to the Milne problem consideration for continuum. We shortly
discuss the impossibility of the Milne problem for the resonance radiation. We
assume that the resonant atoms are located in a thin layer of an accretion disc
near the surface. In this case the resonance line emission arises due to
scattering of a continuum on the resonant atoms. In thin layer we can neglect
the multiple scattering of the resonance radiation on the resonant atoms. We
consider the axially symmetric problems, where the Stokes parameter U =0. We
take into account the Doppler effect for the frequencies of the resonance line.
The three types of the resonant atom sources are considered (see Figs.1-3). The
first source is the axially symmetric continuous distribution of the resonant
atoms along the circular orbit. The second spot-like source rotates in the
orbit. The third type presents two spot-like sources located in the orbit
contrary one to another. In the first and third cases the shape of the emitting
resonance line is symmetric, i.e. the right and left wings have the similar
shapes. In the second case the resonance line has asymmetric shape. The shape
of the emerging line depends significantly on the ratio of the rotation
velocity value to the velocity, characterizing the Doppler width. It also
depends on the ratio of the electron number density to the number density of
resonant atoms. The results of the calculations characterize the different
observational effects of H$\alpha$ radiation in the accretion discs and can be
used for estimations of the parameters mentioned above.

Title:A multi-wavelength study of the debris disc around 49 Cet,"
Abstract:  In a multi-wavelength study of thermal emission and scattered light images we
analyse the dust properties and structure of the debris disc around the A1-type
main sequence star 49~Cet. As a basis for this study, we present new scattered
light images of the debris disc known to possess both a high amount of dust and
gas. The outer region of the disc is revealed in former coronagraphic H-band
and our new Y-band images from the Very Large Telescope SPHERE instrument. We
use the knowledge of the disc's radial extent inferred from ALMA observations
and the grain size distribution found by SED fitting to generate semi-dynamical
dust models of the disc. We compare the models to scattered light and thermal
emission data and find that a disc with a maximum of the surface density at
110~au and shallow edges can describe both thermal emission and scattered light
observations. This suggests that grains close to the blow-out limit and large
grains stem from the same planetesimal population and are mainly influenced by
radiation pressure. The influence of inwards transport processes could not be
analysed in this study.

Title:Observational limits on the X-ray emission from the bubble nebula surrounding Ho IX X-1,"
Abstract:  Optical and radio observations of shock-ionised bubble nebulae surrounding
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) suggest that they are powered by jets or
super-critical outflows presumably launched from the ULX accretion disc. Recent
simulations of these systems have shown that the shocked wind can emit thermal
X-rays with estimated luminosities $\sim 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In this work,
we investigated whether it is possible to detect and spatially resolve the
X-ray emission from these systems using archival Chandra observations of the
ULX Holmberg IX X-1. This source is an ideal target to study for two reasons:
it is surrounded by an optical bubble nebula with a large spatial extent
($\sim$ 400 pc) that can easily be resolved with Chandra. Further, it has a
hard X-ray continuum that is easily distinguishable from the expected soft
thermal emission from the nebula. However, a spectral and photometric analysis
on stacked Chandra observations of the source reveals that there is no strong
evidence for an X-ray bubble associated with it, to a limiting luminosity of
$\sim 2 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The detection of such X-ray nebulae may
be possible with future X-ray missions such as Athena, which would provide
useful constraints on the kinematics of the outflow. Finally, our observations
also emphasise that the nebular emission does not contribute significantly to
the residuals in the X-ray spectrum of the source, which are more likely to be
linked to processes localised to the ULX.

Title:A convolutional neural network approach for reconstructing polarization information of photoelectric X-ray polarimeters,"
Abstract:  This paper presents a data processing algorithm with machine learning for
polarization extraction and event selection applied to photoelectron track
images taken with X-ray polarimeters. The method uses a convolutional neural
network (CNN) classification to predict the azimuthal angle and 2-D position of
the initial photoelectron emission from a 2-D track image projected along the
X-ray incident direction. Two CNN models are demonstrated with data sets
generated by a Monte Carlo simulation: one has a commonly used loss function
calculated by the cross entropy and the other has an additional loss term to
penalize nonuniformity for an unpolarized modulation curve based on the
$H$-test, which is used for periodic signal search in X-ray/$\gamma$-ray
astronomy. The modulation curve calculated by the former model with unpolarized
data has several irregular features, which can be canceled out by unfolding the
angular response or simulating the detector rotation. On the other hand, the
latter model can predict a flat modulation curve with a residual systematic
modulation down to $\lesssim1$%. Both models show almost the same modulation
factors and position accuracy of less than 2 pixel (or 240 $\mu$m) for all four
test energies of 2.7, 4.5, 6.4, and 8.0 keV. In addition, event selection is
performed based on probabilities from the CNN to maximize the polarization
sensitivity considering a trade-off between the modulation factor and signal
acceptance. The developed method with machine learning improves the
polarization sensitivity by 10-20%, compared to that determined with the image
moment method developed previously.

Title:Radiation intensity and polarization from accretion discs with progressive increasing height,"
Abstract:  The article considers the optically thick accretion discs with the
progressive increasing height. The surface is assumed to be the conical form.
The radiation with considered wavelength emerges from an ring on the cone and
is described by the Milne problem for the intensity and polarization. The
inclination angles of the rings are taken 15 and 30 grad. The inclination
angles between the line of sight and the normal to the central accretion disc
plane are taken 30, 45, 60 grad for every value of the ring inclination. For
the continuum radiation the polarization of the emerging light is less than
that in the case of the plane accretion disc. The polarization position angles
of radiation emerging from the right and left parts of the ring are opposite
one another. They are determined by the geometry of the problem. The position
angle of the observed continuum radiation is parallel to the central plane of
the accretion disc. Our theory gives the new explanation of that the position
angles in ""red"" and ""blue"" wings of a spectral line are opposite one another.
This behavior exists in many Seyfert galaxies.

Title:Final spin states of eccentric ocean planets,"
Abstract:  Eccentricity tides generate a torque that can drive an ocean planet towards
asynchronous rotation states of equilibrium when enhanced by resonances
associated with the oceanic tidal modes. We investigate the impact of
eccentricity tides on the rotation of rocky planets hosting a thin uniform
ocean and orbiting cool dwarf stars such as TRAPPIST-1, with orbital periods
~1-10 days. Combining the linear theory of oceanic tides in the shallow water
approximation with the Andrade model for the solid part of the planet, we
develop a global model including the coupling effects of ocean loading,
self-attraction, and deformation of the solid regions. We derive from this
model analytic solutions for the tidal Love numbers and torque exerted on the
planet. These solutions are used with realistic values of parameters provided
by advanced models of the internal structure and tidal oscillations of solid
bodies to explore the parameter space both analytically and numerically. Our
model allows us to fully characterise the frequency-resonant tidal response of
the planet, and particularly the features of resonances associated with the
oceanic tidal modes (eigenfrequencies, resulting maxima of the tidal torque and
Love numbers) as functions of the planet parameters (mass, radius, Andrade
parameters, ocean depth and Rayleigh drag frequency). Resonances associated
with the oceanic tide decrease the critical eccentricity beyond which
asynchronous rotation states distinct from the usual spin-orbit resonances can
exist. We provide an estimation and scaling laws for this critical
eccentricity, which is found to be lowered by roughly one order of magnitude,
switching from ~0.3 to ~0.06 in typical cases and to ~0.01 in extremal ones.

clocks of all optical modules in the grid during a life time of at least 20
years.

Title:Solar photosphere magnetization,"
Abstract:  A recent review shows that observations performed with different telescopes,
spectral lines, and interpretation methods all agree about a vertical magnetic
field gradient in solar active regions on the order of 3 G/km, when a
horizontal magnetic field gradient of only 0.3 G/km is found. This represents
an inexplicable discrepancy with respect to the divB=0 law. The objective of
this paper is to explain these observations through the law B=\mu_0(H+M) in
magnetized media. Magnetization is due to plasma diamagnetism, which results
from the spiral motion of free electrons or charges about the magnetic field.
Their usual photospheric densities lead to very weak magnetization M, four
orders of magnitude lower than H. It is then assumed that electrons escape from
the solar interior, where their thermal velocity is much higher than the escape
velocity, in spite of the effect of protons. They escape from lower layers in a
quasi-static spreading, and accumulate in the photosphere. By evaluating the
magnetic energy of an elementary atom embedded in the magnetized medium obeying
the macroscopic law B=\mu_0(H+M), it is shown that the Zeeman Hamiltonian is
due to the effect of H. Thus, what is measured is H. The decrease in density
with height is responsible for non-zero divergence of M, which is compensated
for by the divergence of H, in order to ensure divB=0. The behavior of the
observed quantities is recovered. The problem of the divergence of the observed
magnetic field in solar active regions finally reveals evidence of electron
accumulation in the solar photosphere. This is not the case of the heavier
protons, which remain in lower layers. An electric field would thus be present
in the solar interior, but as the total charge remains negligible, no electric
field or effect would result outside the star.

wave sky, detecting tens of thousands of individual astrophysical sources
ranging from white-dwarf binaries in our own galaxy to mergers of massive black
holes at redshifts extending beyond the epoch of reionization. These
observations will inform - and transform - our understanding of the end state
of stellar evolution, massive black hole birth, and the co-evolution of
galaxies and black holes through cosmic time. LISA also has the potential to
detect gravitational wave emission from elusive astrophysical sources such as
intermediate-mass black holes as well as exotic cosmological sources such as
inflationary fields and cosmic string cusps.

Title:CMB constraints on ultra-light primordial black holes with extended mass distributions,"
Abstract:  We examine the effects ultra-light primordial black holes (PBHs) have on the
anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). PBHs in the mass range
of $10^{15}$ to $10^{17}$ g emit Hawking radiation in the early Universe,
modifying the standard recombination history. This leads to a damping of
small-scale temperature and polarisation anisotropies and enhances large-scale
polarisation fluctuations. As some models of inflation predict PBHs with a
range of masses, we investigate the impacts of extended mass distributions on
PBH abundance constraints. We model PBH energy injection using a ground-up
approach incorporating species-dependent deposition efficiencies. By allowing
the $\Lambda$CDM parameters to vary simultaneously with the PBH fraction and
mass, we show that exclusion bounds on the PBH fraction of DM $f_\text{PBH}$
are relaxed by up to an order of magnitude, compared to the case of fixed
$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We also give 95% exclusion regions for $f_\text{PBH}$
for a variety of mass distributions. In particular, for a uniform mass
distribution between $10^{15}$ and $10^{17}$ g, we find $f_\text{PBH} < 1.6
\times 10^{-5}$ when allowing $\Lambda$CDM parameters to vary.

Title:Zinc isotope analyses of singularly small samples (<5 ng Zn): investigating chondrule-matrix complementarity in Leoville,"
Abstract:  The potential complementarity between chondrules and matrix of chondrites,
the Solar System's building blocks, is still a highly debated subject.
Complementary superchrondritic compositions of chondrite matrices and
subchondritic chondrules may point to formation of these components within the
same reservoir or, alternatively, to mobilization of elements during secondary
alteration on chondrite parent bodies. Zinc isotope fractionation through
evaporation during chondrule formation may play an important role in
identifying complementary relationships between chondrules and matrix and is
additionally a mobile element during hydrothermal processes. In an effort to
distinguish between primary Zn isotope fractionation during chondrule formation
and secondary alteration, we here report the Zn isotope data of five chondrule
cores, five corresponding igneous rims and two matrices of the relatively
unaltered Leoville CV3.1 chondrite. The detail required for these analyses
necessitated the development of an adjusted Zn isotope analyses protocol
outlined in this study.

Title:The gas depletion factor in galaxy clusters: implication from Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarization experiment measurements,"
Abstract:  The gas depletion factor $\gamma(z)$, i.e., the average ratio of the gas mass
fraction to the cosmic mean baryon fraction of galaxy clusters, plays a very
important role in the cosmological application of the gas mass fraction
measurements. In this paper, using the newest catalog of 182 galaxy clusters
detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Polarization experiment, we
investigate the possible redshift evolution of $\gamma(z)$ through a new
cosmology-independent method. The method is based on non-parametric
reconstruction using the measurements of Hubble parameters from cosmic
chronometers. Unlike hydrodynamical simulations suggesting constant depletion
factor, our results reveal the trend of $\gamma(z)$ decreasing with redshift.
This result is supported by a parametric model fit as well as by calculations
on the reduced ACTPol sample and on the alternative sample of 91 SZ clusters
reported earlier in ACT compilation. Discussion of possible systematic effects
leaves an open question about validity of the empirical relation
$M_{tot}$-$f_{gas}$ obtained on very close clusters. These results might pave
the way to explore the hot gas fraction within large radii of galaxy clusters
as well as its possible evolution with redshift, which should be studied
further on larger galaxy cluster samples in the upcoming X-ray/SZ cluster
surveys.

extensively tested in different spectroscopic studies of FGK-type stars with
several spectrographs and against myriads of Gaia-ESO Survey UVES U580 spectra
of late-type, low-mass stars as one of its thirteen pipelines.
Aims: We describe the code and test it against a library of well
characterised Gaia benchmark stars. We also release the code to the community

Methods: We carried out the required EW determination of Fe I and Fe II
spectral lines using the automatic tool TAME. StePar implements a grid of MARCS
model atmospheres and the MOOG radiative transfer code to compute stellar
atmospheric parameters by means of a Downhill Simplex minimisation algorithm.
Results: We show the results of the benchmark star test and also discuss the
limitations of the EW method, and hence the code. In addition, we found a small
internal scatter for the benchmark stars of 9 +- 32 K in Teff, 0.00 +- 0.07 dex
in log(g), and 0.00 +- 0.03 dex in [Fe/H]. Finally, we advise against using

UMa in quiescence, by fitting Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and
International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra with model accretion disks and
high gravity photosphere models. Using the Gaia parallax distance and an
orbital inclination of $50^{\circ}$, we find that during the brief quiescence
of only four days, the accretion rate is $7.3 \times 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$/yr,
with the ER UMa white dwarf contributing 55% of the FUV flux and the accretion
disk contributing the remaining 45\% of the flux. The white dwarf in ER UMa is
markedly hotter (32,000~K) than the other white dwarfs in dwarf novae below the
CV period gap which have typical temperatures $\sim$15,000~K. For a higher
inclinations of 60 to 75 degrees, the accretion rates that we derive are
roughly an order of magnitude higher $1 - 3 \times 10^{-10}M_{\odot}$/yr.

Title:Are most Cataclysmic Variables in Globular Clusters dynamically formed?,"
Abstract:  We have been investigating populations of cataclysmic variables (CVs) in a
set of more than 300 globular cluster (GC) models evolved with the MOCCA code.
One of the main questions we have intended to answer is whether most CVs in GCs
are dynamically formed or not. Contrary to what has been argued for a long
time, we found that dynamical destruction of primordial CV progenitors is much
stronger in GCs than dynamical formation of CVs. In particular, we found that,
on average, the detectable CV population is predominantly composed of CVs
formed via a typical common envelope phase (> 70 per cent). However,
core-collapsed models tend to have higher fractions of bright CVs than
non-core-collapsed ones, which suggests then that the formation of CVs is
indeed slightly favoured through strong dynamical interactions in
core-collapsed GCs, due to the high stellar densities in their cores.

Title:Small-scale structure of primordial black hole dark matter and its implications for accretion,"
Abstract:  Primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM) nonlinear small-scale structure
formation begins before the epoch of recombination due to large Poisson density
fluctuations. Those small-scale effects still survive today, distinguishing
physics of PBH DM structure formation from the one involving WIMP DM. We
construct an analytic model for the small-scale PBH velocities that reproduces
the velocity floor seen in numerical simulations, and investigate how these
motions impact PBH accretion bounds at different redshifts. We find that the
effect is small at the time of recombination, leaving the cosmic microwave
background bounds on PBH abundance unchanged. However, already at $z=20$ the
PBH internal motion significantly reduces their accretion due to the additional
$1/v^6$ suppression, affecting the 21 cm bounds. Today the accretion bounds
arising from dwarf galaxies or smaller PBH substructures are all reduced by the
PBH velocity floor. We also investigate the feasibility for the PBH clusters to
coherently accrete gas leading to a possible enhancement proportional to the
cluster's occupation number but find this effect to be insignificant for PBH
around $10 M_{\odot}$ or lighter. Those results should be reconsidered if the
initial PBH distribution is not Poisson, for example, in the case of large
initial PBH clustering.

network of telescopes around the globe organised for follow-up observations of
transiting planet candidate Kepler objects of interest (KOIs) with large
transit timing variations (TTVs). The main goal of KOINet is the completion of
their TTV curves as the Kepler telescope stopped observing the original Kepler
field in 2013.
Aims. We ensure a comprehensive characterisation of the investigated systems
by analysing Kepler data combined with new ground-based transit data using a
photodynamical model. This method is applied to the Kepler-82 system leading to
its first dynamic analysis.
Methods. In order to provide a coherent description of all observations
simultaneously, we combine the numerical integration of the gravitational
dynamics of a system over the time span of observations with a transit light
curve model. To explore the model parameter space, this photodynamical model is
coupled with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
Results. The Kepler-82b/c system shows sinusoidal TTVs due to their near 2:1
resonance dynamical interaction. An additional chopping effect in the TTVs of
Kepler-82c hints to a further planet near the 3:2 or 3:1 resonance. We

Title:Predictions for solar flares activity in solar cycle 25,"
Abstract:  The prediction of the evolution of individual solar cycles is a developing
field, faced with divergence of forecasts even for a few years in the future.
Specifically for solar flares, long-term modeling is practically absent even in
rough terms. In this article a forecast for the evolution of solar cycle 25 in
terms of solar flares activity is presented. It is derived from an existing
phenomenological model based on the coupling of an internal solar component and
a planetary component. In addition to competent temporal resolution, the
predictions are characterized by features which both differentiate the model
from other space climate forecasts and make it falsifiable.

Title:Partitioning the universe into gravitational basins using the cosmic velocity field,"
Abstract:  This letter presents a new approach using the cosmic peculiar velocity field
to characterize the morphology and size of large scale structures in the local
Universe. The algorithm developed uses the three-dimensional peculiar velocity
field to compute flow lines, or streamlines. The local Universe is then
partitioned into volumes corresponding to gravitational basins, also called
watersheds, among the different end-points of the velocity flow lines. This new
methodology is first tested on numerical cosmological simulations, used as
benchmark for the method, and then applied to the {\it Cosmic-Flows} project
observational data in order to to pay particular attention to the nearby
superclusters including ours. More extensive tests on both simulated and
observational data will be discussed in an accompanying paper.

Title:Weighing neutrinos with the halo environment,"
Abstract:  Nonlinear objects like halos and voids exhibit a scale-dependent bias on
linear scales in massive neutrino cosmologies. The shape of this
scale-dependent bias is a unique signature of the neutrino masses, but the
amplitude of the signal is generally small, of the order of $f_\nu$, the
contribution of neutrinos to the total matter content ($\lesssim 1\%$). In this
paper, we demonstrate for the first time how the strength of this signal can be
substantially enhanced by using information about the halo environment at a
range of scales. This enhancement is achieved by using certain combinations of
the large scale Cold Dark Matter and total matter environments of halos, both
of which are measurable from galaxy clustering and weak lensing surveys.

Title:Lens modelling of the strongly lensed Type Ia supernova iPTF16geu,"
Abstract:  In 2016, the first strongly lensed Type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu at redshift
$z=0.409$ with four resolved images arranged symmetrically around the lens
galaxy at $z=0.2163$, was discovered. Here, refined observations of iPTF16geu,
including the time delay between images, are used to decrease uncertainties in
the lens model, including the the slope of the projected surface density of the
lens galaxy, $\Sigma\propto r^{1-\eta}$, and to constrain the universal
expansion rate $H_0$. Imaging with HST provides an upper limit on the slope
$\eta$, in slight tension with the steeper density profiles indicated by
imaging with Keck after iPTF16geu had faded, potentially due to dust extinction
not corrected for in host galaxy imaging. Since smaller $\eta$ implies larger
magnifications, we take advantage of the standard candle nature of Type Ia
supernovae constraining the image magnifications, to obtain an independent
constraint of the slope. We find that a smooth lens density fails to explain
the iPTF16geu fluxes, regardless of the slope, and additional sub-structure
lensing is needed. The total probability for the smooth halo model combined
with star microlensing to explain the iPTF16geu image fluxes is maximized at
$12\,\%$ for $\eta\sim 1.8$, in excellent agreement with Keck high spatial
resolution data, and flatter than an isothermal halo. It also agrees perfectly
with independent constraints on the slope from lens velocity dispersion
measurements. Combining with the observed time delays between the images, we
infer a lower bound on the Hubble constant, $H_0 \gtrsim 40\,{\rm km \ s^{-1}
Mpc^{-1}}$ at $68.3\,\%$ confidence level.

Title:Covariance matrices for galaxy cluster weak lensing: from virial regime to uncorrelated large-scale structure,"
Abstract:  Next-generation optical imaging surveys will revolutionise the observations
of weak gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters and provide stringent
constraints on growth of structure and cosmic acceleration. In these
experiments, accurate modelling of covariance matrices of cluster weak lensing
plays the key role in obtaining robust measurements of the mean mass of
clusters and cosmological parameters. We use a combination of analytical
calculations and high-resolution N-body simulations to derive accurate
covariance matrices that span from the virial regime to linear scales of the
cluster-matter cross-correlation. We validate this calculation using a public
ray-tracing lensing simulation and provide a software package for calculating
covariance matrices for a wide range of cluster and source sample choices. We
discuss the relative importance of shape noise and density fluctuations, the
impact of radial bin size, and the impact of off-diagonal elements. For a weak
lensing source density 10 per square arcmin, shape noise typically dominates
the variance on comoving scales less than 5 Mpc/h. However, for 60 per square
arcmin, potentially achievable with future weak lensing experiments, density
fluctuations typically dominate the variance at scales greater than 1 Mpc/h and
remain comparable to shape noise on smaller scales.

Title:The prevalence of repeating fast radio bursts,"
Abstract:  Fast radio bursts are extragalactic, sub-millisecond radio impulses of
unknown origin [1,2]. Their dispersion measures, which quantify the observed
frequency-dependent dispersive delays in terms of free-electron column
densities, significantly exceed predictions from models [3] of the Milky Way
interstellar medium. The excess dispersions are likely accrued as fast radio
bursts propagate through their host galaxies, gaseous galactic halos and the
intergalactic medium [4,5]. Despite extensive follow-up observations of the
published sample of 72 burst sources [6], only two are observed to repeat
[7,8], and it is unknown whether or not the remainder are truly one-off events.
Here I show that the volumetric occurrence rate of so far non-repeating fast
radio bursts likely exceeds the rates of candidate cataclysmic progenitor
events, and also likely exceeds the birth rates of candidate compact-object
sources. This analysis is based on the high detection rate of bursts with low
dispersion measures by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment [9].
Within the existing suite of astrophysical scenarios for fast radio burst
progenitors, I conclude that most observed cases originate from sources that
emit several bursts over their lifetimes.

Title:Estimating the angular power spectrum of the gravitational-wave background in the presence of shot noise,"
Abstract:  There has been much recent interest in studying anisotropies in the
astrophysical gravitational-wave (GW) background, as these could provide us
with interesting new information about galaxy clustering and large-scale
structure. However, this information is obscured by shot noise, caused by the
finite number of GW sources that contribute to the background at any given
time. We develop a new method for estimating the angular spectrum of
anisotropies, based on the principle of combining statistically-independent
data segments. We show that this gives an unbiased estimate of the true,
astrophysical spectrum, removing the offset due to shot noise power, and that
in the limit of many data segments, it is the most efficient (i.e.
lowest-variance) estimator possible.

Title:Physical Characterization of Active Asteroid (6478) Gault,"
Abstract:  Main belt asteroid (6478) Gault has been dynamically linked with two
overlapping asteroid families: Phocaea, dominated by S-type asteroids, and
Tamara, dominated by low-albedo C-types. This object has recently become an
interesting case for study, after images obtained in late 2018 revealed that it
was active and displaying a comet-like tail. Previous authors have proposed
that the most likely scenarios to explain the observed activity on Gault were
rotational excitation or merger of near-contact binaries. Here we use new
photometric and spectroscopic data of Gault to determine its physical and
compositional properties. Lightcurves derived from the photometric data showed
little variation over three nights of observations, which prevented us from
determining the rotation period of the asteroid. Using WISE observations of
Gault and the near-Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM) we determined that this
asteroid has a diameter $<$6 km. NIR spectroscopic data obtained with the
Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) showed a spectrum similar to that of
S-complex asteroids, and a surface composition consistent with H chondrite
meteorites. These results favor a compositional affinity between Gault and
asteroid (25) Phocaea, and rules out a compositional link with the Tamara
family. From the spectroscopic data we found no evidence of fresh material that
could have been exposed during the outburst episodes.

Title:Environment from cross-correlations: connecting hot gas and the quenching of galaxies,"
Abstract:  The observable properties of galaxies depend on both internal processes and
the external environment. In terms of the environmental role, we still do not
have a clear picture of the processes driving the transformation of galaxies.
The use of proxies for environment (e.g., host halo mass, distance to the N^th
nearest neighbour, etc.), as opposed to the real physical conditions (e.g., hot
gas density) may bear some responsibility for this. Here we propose a new
method that directly links galaxies to their local environments, by using
spatial cross-correlations of galaxy catalogues with maps from large-scale
structure surveys (e.g., thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich [tSZ] effect, diffuse X-ray
emission, weak lensing of galaxies or the CMB). We focus here on the quenching
of galaxies and its link to local hot gas properties. Maps of galaxy
overdensity and quenched fraction excess are constructed from volume-limited
SDSS catalogs, which are cross-correlated with tSZ effect and X-ray maps from
Planck and ROSAT, respectively. Strong signals out to Mpc scales are detected
for most cross-correlations and are compared to predictions from the EAGLE and
BAHAMAS cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The simulations successfully
reproduce many, but not all, of the observed power spectra, with an indication
that environmental quenching may be too efficient in the simulations. We
demonstrate that the cross-correlations are sensitive to both the internal
(e.g., AGN and stellar feedback) and external processes (e.g., ram pressure
stripping, harassment, strangulation, etc.) responsible for quenching. The
methods outlined in this paper can be adapted to other observables and, with
upcoming surveys, will provide a stringent test of physical models for
environmental transformation.

Title:SOFIA/HAWC+ traces the magnetic fields in NGC 1068,"
Abstract:  We report the first detection of galactic spiral structure by means of
thermal emission from magnetically aligned dust grains. Our 89 $\mu$m
polarimetric imaging of NGC 1068 with the High-resolution Airborne Wideband
Camera/Polarimeter (HAWC+) on NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA) also sheds light on magnetic field structure in the vicinity
of the galaxy's inner-bar and active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find
correlations between the 89 $\mu$m magnetic field vectors and other tracers of
spiral arms, and a symmetric polarization pattern as a function of the
azimuthal angle arising from the projection and inclination of the disk field
component in the plane of the sky. The observations can be fit with a
logarithmic spiral model with pitch angle of $16.9^{+2.7}_{-2.8}$$^{\circ}$ and
a disk inclination of $48\pm2^{\circ}$. We infer that the bulk of the
interstellar medium from which the polarized dust emission originates is
threaded by a magnetic field that closely follows the spiral arms. Inside the
central starburst disk ($<1.6$ kpc), the degree of polarization is found to be
lower than for far-infrared sources in the Milky Way, and has minima at the
locations of most intense star formation near the outer ends of the inner-bar.
Inside the starburst ring, the field direction deviates from the model,
becoming more radial along the leading edges of the inner-bar. The polarized
flux and dust temperature peak $\sim 3-6$"" NE of the AGN at the location of a
bow shock between the AGN outflow and the surrounding interstellar medium, but
the AGN itself is weakly polarized ($< 1$%) at both 53 and 89 \um.

Title:The lensing properties of subhaloes in massive elliptical galaxies in sterile neutrino cosmologies,"
Abstract:  We use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations run with the EAGLE model of
galaxy formation to study the differences between the properties of - and
subsequently the lensing signal from - subhaloes of massive elliptical galaxies
at redshift 0.2, in Cold and Sterile Neutrino (SN) Dark matter models. We focus
on the two 7 keV SN models that bracket the range of matter power spectra
compatible with resonantly-produced SN as the source of the observed 3.5 keV
line. We derive an accurate parametrisation for the subhalo mass function in
these two SN models relative to CDM, as well as the subhalo spatial
distribution, density profile, and projected number density and the dark matter
fraction in subhaloes. We create mock lensing maps from the simulated haloes to
study the differences in the lensing signal in the framework of subhalo
detection. We find that subhalo convergence is well described by a log-normal
distribution and that signal of subhaloes in the power spectrum is lower in SN
models with respect to CDM, at a level of 10 to 80 per cent, depending on the
scale. However, the scatter between different projections is large and might
make the use of power-spectrum studies on the typical scales of current lensing
images very difficult. Moreover, in the framework of individual detections
through gravitational imaging a sample of ~30 lenses with an average
sensitivity of M_sub=5x10^7M_sun would be required to discriminate between CDM
and the considered sterile neutrino models.

Title:Cataloging Accreted Stars within Gaia DR2 using Deep Learning,"
Abstract:  The goal of this study is to present the development of a machine learning
based approach that utilizes phase space alone to separate the Gaia DR2 stars
into two categories: those accreted onto the Milky Way from those that are in
situ. Traditional selection methods that have been used to identify accreted
stars typically rely on full 3D velocity, metallicity information, or both,
which significantly reduces the number of classifiable stars. The approach
advocated here is applicable to a much larger portion of Gaia DR2. A method
known as ""transfer learning"" is shown to be effective through extensive testing
on a set of mock Gaia catalogs that are based on the FIRE cosmological zoom-in
hydrodynamic simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. The machine is first
trained on simulated data using only 5D kinematics as inputs and is then
further trained on a cross-matched Gaia/RAVE data set, which improves
sensitivity to properties of the real Milky Way. The result is a catalog that
identifies around 767,000 accreted stars within Gaia DR2. This catalog can
yield empirical insights into the merger history of the Milky Way and could be
used to infer properties of the dark matter distribution.

strong observational evidence that cosmic reionization ended approximately one

decade. This article gives an introduction to the theoretical and observational

Title:Scaling relations and baryonic cycling in local star-forming galaxies: I. The sample,"
Abstract:  Metallicity and gas content are intimately related in the baryonic exchange
cycle of galaxies, and galaxy evolution scenarios can be constrained by
quantifying this relation. To this end, we have compiled a sample of ~400
galaxies in the Local Universe, dubbed ""MAGMA"" (Metallicity And Gas for Mass
Assembly), which covers an unprecedented range in parameter space, spanning
more than 5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass (Mstar), star-formation rate
(SFR), and gas mass (Mgas), and a factor of ~60 in metallicity [Z,
12+log(O/H)]. Stellar masses and SFRs have been recalculated for all the
galaxies using IRAC, WISE and GALEX photometry, and 12+log(O/H) has been
transformed, where necessary, to a common metallicity calibration. To assess
the true dimensionality of the data, we have applied multi-dimensional
principal component analyses (PCAs) to our sample. In confirmation of previous
work, we find that even with the vast parameter space covered by MAGMA, the
relations between Mstar, SFR, Z and Mgas (MHI+MH2) require only two dimensions
to describe the hypersurface. To accommodate the curvature in the Mstar-Z
relation, we have applied a piecewise 3D PCA that successfully predicts
observed 12+log(O/H) to an accuracy of ~0.1dex. MAGMA is a representative
sample of isolated star-forming galaxies in the Local Universe, and can be used
as a benchmark for cosmological simulations and to calibrate evolutionary
trends with redshift.

Abstract:  Theoretical studies suggest that a giant planet around the young star MWC 758
could be responsible for driving the spiral features in its circumstellar disk.
Here, we present a deep imaging campaign with the Large Binocular Telescope
with the primary goal of imaging the predicted planet. We present images of the
disk in two epochs in the $L^{\prime}$ filter (3.8 $\mu m$) and a third epoch
in the $M^{\prime}$ filter (4.8 $\mu m$). The two prominent spiral arms are
detected in each observation, which constitute the first images of the disk at
$M^\prime$, and the deepest yet in $L^\prime$ ($\Delta L^\prime=$12.1 exterior
to the disk at 5$\sigma$ significance). We report the detection of a
S/N$\sim$3.9 source near the end of the Sourthern arm, and, from the source's
detection at a consistent position and brightness during multiple epochs, we
establish a $\sim$90% confidence-level that the source is of astrophysical
origin. We discuss the possibilities that this feature may be a) an unresolved
disk feature, and b) a giant planet responsible for the spiral arms, with
several arguments pointing in favor of the latter scenario. We present
additional detection limits on companions exterior to the spiral arms, which
suggest that a $\lesssim$4 M$_{Jup}$ planet exterior to the spiral arms could
have escaped detection. Finally, we do not detect the companion candidate
interior to the spiral arms reported recently by Reggiani et al. (2018),
although forward modelling suggests that such a source would have likely been
detected.

Title:Cosmological test of gravity using weak lensing voids,"
Abstract:  Modifications to General Relativity (GR) often incorporate screening
mechanisms in order to remain compatible with existing tests of gravity. The
screening is less efficient in underdense regions, which suggests that cosmic
voids can be a useful cosmological probe for constraining modified gravity
models. In particular, weak lensing by voids has been proposed as a promising
test of such theories. Usually, voids are identified from galaxy distributions,
making them biased tracers of the underlying matter field. An alternative
approach is to study voids identified in weak lensing maps -- weak lensing
voids -- which have been shown to better correspond to true underdense regions.
In this paper, we study the ability of weak lensing voids to detect the
signatures of modified gravity. Focusing on the void abundance and weak lensing
profiles, we find that both statistics are sensitive probes of gravity. These
are quantified in terms of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) with which an
LSST-like survey will be able to distinguish between different gravity models.
We find that the tangential shear profiles of weak lensing voids are
considerably better than galaxy voids at this, though voids have somewhat lower
SNR than weak lensing peaks. The abundances of voids and peaks have
respectively $\rm{SNR} = 50$ and $70$ for a popular class of modified gravity
in an LSST-like survey.

Abstract:  A sensitive survey of the MeV gamma-ray sky is needed to understand important

progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, and the nature of dark matter. However, the
study has not progressed remarkably since the limited survey by COMPTEL onboard
CGRO in the 1990s. Tanimori et al. have developed a Compton camera that tracks
the trajectory of each recoil electron in addition to the information obtained
by the conventional Compton cameras, leading to superior imaging. This Electron
Tracking Compton Camera (ETCC) facilitates accurate reconstruction of the
incoming direction of each MeV photon from a wide sky at ~degree angular
resolution and with minimized particle background using trajectory information.
The latest ETCC model, SMILE-2+, made successful astronomical observations
during a day balloon flight in 2018 April and detected diffuse continuum and
511 keV annihilation line emission from the Galactic Center region at a high
significance in ~2.5 hours. We believe that MeV observations from space with
upgraded ETCCs will dramatically improve our knowledge of the MeV universe. We
advocate for a space-based all-sky survey mission with multiple ETCCs onboard

Title:Nekhoroshev Estimates for the Survival Time of Tightly Packed Planetary Systems,"
Abstract:  $N$-body simulations of non-resonant tightly-packed planetary systems have
found that their survival time (i.e. time to first close encounter) grows
exponentially with their interplanetary spacing and planetary masses. Although
this result has important consequences for the assembly of planetary systems by
giants collisions and their long-term evolution, this underlying exponential
dependence is not understood from first principles, and previous attempts based
on orbital diffusion have only yielded power-law scalings. We propose a
different picture, where large deviations of the system from its initial
conditions is due to few slowly developing high-order resonances. Thus, we show
that the survival time of the system $T$ can be estimated using a heuristic
motivated by Nekhoroshev's theorem, and obtain a formula for systems away from
overlapping two-body mean-motion resonances as: $T/P=c_1 \frac{a}{\Delta a}
\exp \left(c_2 \frac{\Delta a}{a} /\mu^{1/4}\right)$, where $P$ is the average
Keplerian period, $a$ is the average semi major axis, $\Delta a\ll a$ is the
difference between the semi major axes of neighbouring planets, $\mu$ is the
planet to star mass ratio, and $c_1$ and $c_2$ are dimensionless constants. We
show that this formula is in good agreement with numerical N-body experiments
for $c_1=5 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and $c_2=8$.

identification of a substellar transiting object orbiting an A star at the
periphery of the superstamp. To investigate this transiting source, we
performed ground based follow-up observations, including photometry with the
Las Cumbres Observatory telescope network and high resolution spectroscopy with
Keck/HIRES. We confirm that the host star is a hot, rapidly rotating star,
precluding precision radial velocity measurements. We nevertheless present a
statistical validation of the planet or brown dwarf candidate using speckle
interferometry from the WIYN telescope to rule out false positive stellar
eclipsing binary scenarios. Based on parallax and proper motion data from Gaia
Data Release 2 (DR2), we conclude that the star is not likely to be a member of
M35, but instead is a background star around 100 pc behind the cluster. We
present an updated ephemeris to enable future transit observations. We note
that this is a rare system as a hot host star with a substellar companion. It
has a high potential for future follow-up, including Doppler tomography and

Title:Measuring neutrino masses with large-scale structure: Euclid forecast with controlled theoretical error,"
Abstract:  We present a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) forecast for the precision of
neutrino mass and cosmological parameter measurements with a Euclid-like galaxy
clustering survey. We use a complete perturbation theory model for the galaxy
one-loop power spectrum and tree-level bispectrum, which includes bias,
redshift space distortions, IR resummation for baryon acoustic oscillations and
UV counterterms. The latter encapsulate various effects of short-scale dynamics
which cannot be modeled within perturbation theory. Our MCMC procedure
consistently computes the non-linear power spectra and bispectra as we scan
over different cosmologies. The second ingredient of our approach is the
theoretical error covariance which captures uncertainties due to higher-order
non-linear corrections omitted in our model. Having specified characteristics
of a Euclid-like spectroscopic survey, we generate and fit mock galaxy power
spectrum and bispectrum likelihoods. Our results suggest that even under very
agnostic assumptions about non-linearities and short-scale physics a future
Euclid-like survey will be able to measure the sum of neutrino masses with a
standard deviation of 28 meV. When combined with the Planck cosmic microwave
background likelihood, this uncertainty decreases to 13 meV.
Over-optimistically reducing the theoretical error on the bispectrum down to
the two-loop level marginally tightens this bound to 11 meV. Moreover, we show
that the future large-scale structure (LSS) spectroscopic data will greatly
improve constraints on the other cosmological parameters, e.g. reaching a
percent (per mille) error on the Hubble constant with LSS alone (LSS + Planck).

Title:Understanding Broad Mg II Variability in Quasars with Photoionization: Implications for Reverberation Mapping and Changing-Look Quasars,"
Abstract:  The broad Mg II line in quasars has distinct variability properties compared
with broad Balmer lines: it is less variable, and usually does not display a
""breathing"" mode, the increase in the average cloud distance when luminosity
increases. We demonstrate that these variability properties of Mg II can be
reasonably well explained by simple Locally Optimally Emitting Cloud (LOC)
photoionization models, confirming earlier photoionization results. In the
fiducial LOC model, the Mg II-emitting gas is on average more distant from the
ionizing source than the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ gas, and responds with a lower
amplitude to continuum variations. If the broad-line region (BLR) is truncated
at a physical radius of $\sim 0.3$ pc (for a $10^{8.5}M_{\odot}$ BH accreting
at Eddington ratio of 0.1), most of the Mg II flux will always be emitted near
this outer boundary and hence will not display breathing. These results
indicate that reverberation mapping results on broad Mg II, while generally
more difficult to obtain due to the lower line responsivity, can still be used
to infer the Mg II BLR size and hence black hole mass. But it is possible that
Mg II does not have a well defined intrinsic BLR size-luminosity relation for
individual quasars, even though a global one for the general population may
still exist. The dramatic changes in broad H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ emission in the
observationally-rare changing-look quasars are fully consistent with
photoionization responses to extreme continuum variability, and the LOC model
provides natural explanations for the persistence of broad Mg II in
changing-look quasars defined on H$\alpha$/H$\beta$, and the rare population of
broad Mg II emitters in the spectra of massive inactive galaxies.

more than one thousand seconds very-high-energy (VHE) emission above 300 GeV.
Previous analysis of the multi-wavelength observations showed that although
these are consistent with the synchrotron forward-shock model that evolves from
a stratified stellar-wind to homogeneous ISM-like medium, photons above few
GeVs can hardly be interpreted in the synchrotron framework. In the context of
the synchrotron forward-shock model, we derive the light curves and spectra of
the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model in the stratified and homogeneous
medium. In particular, we study the evolution of these light curves during the
stratified-to-homogeneous afterglow transition. Using the best-fit parameters
reported for GRB 190114C we interpret the photons beyond the synchrotron limit
in the SSC framework and model its spectral energy distribution. We conclude
that low-redshift GRBs described under a favourable set of parameters as found
in the early afterglow of GRB 190114C could be detected at hundreds of GeVs,
and also afterglow transitions would allow that VHE emission could be observed
for longer periods.

Title:Spectral Energy Distributions of Candidate Periodically-Variable Quasars: Testing the Binary Black Hole Hypothesis,"
Abstract:  Periodic quasars are candidates for binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs)
efficiently emitting low frequency gravitational waves. Recently, $\sim$150
candidates were identified from optical synoptic surveys. However, they may be
false positives caused by stochastic quasar variability given the few cycles
covered (typically 1.5). To independently test the binary hypothesis, we search
for evidence of truncated or gapped circumbinary accretion discs (CBDs) in
their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Our work is motivated by CBD
simulations that predict flux deficits as cutoffs from central cavities opened
by secondaries or notches from minidiscs around both BHs. We find that
candidate periodic quasars show SEDs similar to those of control quasars
matched in redshift and luminosity. While seven of 138 candidates show a blue
cutoff in the IR-optical-UV SED, six of which may represent CBDs with central
cavities, the red SED fraction is similar to that in control quasars,
suggesting no correlation between periodicity and SED anomaly. Alternatively,
dust reddening may cause red SEDs. The fraction of extremely radio-loud
quasars, e.g., blazars (with $R>100$), is tentatively higher than that in
control quasars (at 2.5$\sigma$). Our results suggest that, assuming most
periodic candidates are robust, IR-optical-UV SEDs of CBDs are similar to those
of accretion discs of single BHs, if the periodicity is driven by BSBHs; the
higher blazar fraction may signal precessing radio jets. Alternatively, most
current candidate periodic quasars identified from few-cycle light curves may
be false positives. Their tentatively higher blazar fraction and lower
Eddington ratios may both be caused by selection biases.

Title:Remote Dipole Field Reconstruction with Dusty Galaxies,"
Abstract:  The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, cosmic microwave background
(CMB) temperature anisotropies induced by scattering of CMB photons from free
electrons, forms the dominant blackbody component of the CMB on small angular
scales. Future CMB experiments on the resolution/sensitivity frontier will
measure the kSZ effect with high significance. Through the cross-correlation
with tracers of structure, it will be possible to reconstruct the remote CMB
dipole field (e.g. the CMB dipole observed at different locations in the
Universe) using the technique of kSZ tomography. In this paper, we derive a
quadratic estimator for the remote dipole field using the Cosmic Infrared
Background (CIB) as a tracer of structure. We forecast the ability of current
and next-generation measurements of the CMB and CIB to perform kSZ tomography.
The total signal-to-noise of the reconstruction is order unity for current
datasets, and can improve by a factor of up to $10^3$ for future datasets,
based on statistical error only. The CIB-based reconstruction is highly
correlated with a galaxy survey-based reconstruction of the remote dipole
field, which can be exploited to improve constraints on cosmological parameters
and models for the CIB and distribution of baryons.

Title:On the origin of the gamma-ray emission from Omega Centauri: Milisecond pulsars and dark matter annihilation,"
Abstract:  We explore two possible scenarios to explain the observed gamma-ray emission
associated with the atypical globular cluster Omega-Centauri: emission from
millisecond pulsars (MSP) and dark matter (DM) annihilation. In the first case
the total number of MSPs needed to produce the gamma-ray flux is compatible
with the known (but not confirmed) MSP candidates observed in X-rays. A DM
interpretation is motivated by the possibility of Omega-Centauri being the
remnant core of an ancient dwarf galaxy hosting a surviving DM component. At
least two annihilation channels, light quarks and muons, can plausibly produce
the observed gama-ray spectrum. We outline constraints on the parameter space
of DM mass versus the product of the pair-annihilation cross section and
integrated squared DM density (the so-called J-factor). We translate upper
limits on the dark matter content of Omega-Centauri into lower limits on the
annihilation cross section. This shows s-wave annihilation into muons to be
inconsistent with CMB observations, while a small window for annihilation into
light quarks is allowed. Further analysis of Omega-Centauri's internal
kinematics, and/or additional information on the resident MSP population will
yield much stronger constraints and shed light about the origin of this
otherwise mysterious gamma-ray source.

Title:STACEX: RPC-based detector for a multi-messenger observatory in the Southern Hemisphere,"
Abstract:  Extensice Air Shower (EAS) arrays are survey instruments able to monitor
continuously all the overhead sky. Their wide field of view (about 2 sr) is
ideal to complement directional detectors by performing unbiased sky surveys,
by monitoring variable or flaring sources, such as AGNs, and to discover
transients or explosive events (GRBs). With an energy threshold in the 100 GeV
range EAS arrays are transient factories. All EAS arrays presently in operation
or under installation are located in the Northern hemisphere. A new survey
instrument located in the Southern Hemisphere should be a high priority to
monitor the Inner Galaxy and the Galactic Center.
STACEX is the proposal of a hybrid detector with ARGO-like RPCs coupled to
Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) mainly to lower the energy threshold at 100
GeV level.
In this contribution we introduce the possibility of improving the low energy
sensitivity of survey instruments by equipping RPCs, which were proved to be
optimal detectors at 100 GeV energies by the ARGO-YBJ Collaboration, with WCDs.
An EAS detector with high sensitivity between 100 GeV and 1 TeV would be a
valuable complementary transient detector in the CTA era.

Title:The diverse lives of progenitors of hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernovae: the role of binary interaction,"
Abstract:  Hydrogen-rich supernovae, known as Type II (SNe II), are the most common
class of explosions observed following the collapse of the core of massive
stars. We use analytical estimates and population synthesis simulations to
assess the fraction of SNe II progenitors that are expected to have exchanged
mass with a companion prior to explosion. We estimate that 1/3 to 1/2 of SN II
progenitors have a history of mass exchange with a binary companion before
exploding. The dominant binary channels leading to SN II progenitors involve
the merger of binary stars. Mergers are expected to produce a diversity of SN
II progenitor characteristics, depending on the evolutionary timing and
properties of the merger. Alternatively, SN II progenitors from interacting
binaries may have accreted mass from their companion, and subsequently been
ejected from the binary system after their companion exploded. We show that the
overall fraction of SN II progenitors that are predicted to have experienced
binary interaction is robust against the main physical uncertainties in our
models. However, the relative importance of different binary evolutionary
channels is affected by changing physical assumptions. We further discuss ways
in which binarity might contribute to the observed diversity of SNe II by
considering potential observational signatures arising from each binary
channel. For supernovae which have a substantial H-rich envelope at explosion
(i.e., excluding Type IIb SNe), a surviving non-compact companion would
typically indicate that the supernova progenitor star was in a wide,
non-interacting binary. We argue that a significant fraction of even Type II-P
SNe are expected to have gained mass from a companion prior to explosion.

Title:Search for Sources of Astrophysical Neutrinos Using Seven Years of IceCube Cascade Events,"
Abstract:  Low background searches for astrophysical neutrino sources anywhere in the
sky can be performed using cascade events induced by neutrinos of all flavors
interacting in IceCube with energies as low as ~1 TeV. Previously, we showed
that even with just two years of data, the resulting sensitivity to sources in
the southern sky is competitive with IceCube and ANTARES analyses using muon
tracks induced by charge current muon neutrino interactions - especially if the
neutrino emission follows a soft energy spectrum or originates from an extended
angular region. Here, we extend that work by adding five more years of data,
significantly improving the cascade angular resolution, and including tests for
point-like or diffuse Galactic emission to which this dataset is particularly
well-suited. For many of the signal candidates considered, this analysis is the
most sensitive of any experiment. No significant clustering was observed, and
thus many of the resulting constraints are the most stringent to date. In this
paper we will describe the improvements introduced in this analysis and discuss
our results in the context of other recent work in neutrino astronomy.

Title:2020 Vision: Towards a Sustainable OIR System,"
Abstract:  Open-access telescopes of all apertures are needed to operate a competitive
and efficient national science program. While larger facilities contribute
light-gathering power and angular resolution, smaller ones dominate for field
of view, time-resolution, and especially, total available observing time,
thereby enabling our entire, diversely-expert community. Smaller aperture
telescopes therefore play a critical and indispensable role in advancing
science. Thus, the divestment of NSF support for modest-aperture (1 - 4 m)
public telescopes poses a serious threat to U.S. scientific leadership, which
is compounded by the unknown consequences of the shift from observations driven
by individual investigators to survey-driven science. Given the much higher
cost efficiency and dramatic science returns for investments in modest aperture
telescopes, it is hard to justify funding only the most expensive facilities.
We therefore urge the Astro2020 panel to explicitly make the case for modest
aperture facilities, and to recommend enhancing this funding stream to support
and grow this critical component of the OIR System. Further study is urgently
needed to prioritize the numerous exciting potential capabilities of smaller
facilities,and to establish sustainable, long-term planning for the System.

Title:Evolved Massive Stars at Low-metallicity I. A Source Catalog for the Small Magellanic Cloud,"
Abstract:  We present a clean, magnitude-limited (IRAC1 or WISE1 $\leq$ 15.0 mag)
multiwavelength source catalog for the SMC with 45,466 targets in total, with
the purpose of building an anchor for future studies, especially for the
massive star populations at low-metallicity. The catalog contains data in 50
different bands including 21 optical and 29 infrared bands, ranging from the
ultraviolet to the far-infrared. Additionally, radial velocities and spectral
classifications were collected from the literature, as well as infrared and
optical variability statistics were retrieved from different projects. The
catalog was essentially built upon a $1''$ crossmatching and a $3''$ deblending
between the SEIP source list and Gaia DR2 photometric data. Further constraints
on the proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia DR2 allowed us to remove the
foreground contamination. We estimated that about 99.5\% of the targets in our
catalog were most likely genuine members of the SMC. By using the evolutionary
tracks and synthetic photometry from MIST and the theoretical $\rm J-K_S$ color
cuts, we identified 1,405 RSG, 217 YSG and 1,369 BSG candidates in the SMC in
five different CMDs, where attention should also be paid to the incompleteness
of our sample. We ranked the candidates based on the intersection of different
CMDs. A comparison between the models and observational data shows that the
lower limit of initial mass for the RSGs population may be as low as 7 or even
6 $M_{\odot}$ and the RSG is well separated from the AGB population even at
faint magnitude, making RSGs a unique population connecting the evolved massive
and intermediate stars, since stars with initial mass around 6 to 8 $M_{\odot}$
are thought to go through a second dredge-up to become AGBs. We encourage the
interested reader to further exploit the potential of our catalog.

Title:SN 2012dn from early to late times: 09dc-like supernovae reassessed,"
Abstract:  As a candidate 'super-Chandrasekhar' or 09dc-like Type Ia supernova (SN Ia),
SN 2012dn shares many characteristics with other members of this remarkable
class of objects but lacks their extraordinary luminosity. Here, we present and
discuss the most comprehensive optical data set of this SN to date, comprised
of a densely sampled series of early-time spectra obtained within the Nearby
Supernova Factory project, plus photometry and spectroscopy obtained at the VLT
about 1 yr after the explosion. The light curves, colour curves, spectral time
series and ejecta velocities of SN 2012dn are compared with those of other
09dc-like and normal SNe Ia, the overall variety within the class of 09dc-like
SNe Ia is discussed, and new criteria for 09dc-likeness are proposed.
Particular attention is directed to additional insight that the late-phase data
provide. The nebular spectra show forbidden lines of oxygen and calcium,
elements that are usually not seen in late-time spectra of SNe Ia, while the
ionisation state of the emitting iron plasma is low, pointing to low ejecta
temperatures and high densities. The optical light curves are characterised by
an enhanced fading starting ~60 d after maximum and very low luminosities in
the nebular phase, which is most readily explained by unusually early formation
of clumpy dust in the ejecta. Taken together, these effects suggest a strongly
perturbed ejecta density profile, which might lend support to the idea that
09dc-like characteristics arise from a brief episode of interaction with a
hydrogen-deficient envelope during the first hours or days after the explosion.

public and private primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) within the

twelve project years of partnering with Arecibo and Green Bank Observatories,
the UAT has had a demonstrable impact on the health of a legacy astronomy
project, science education, and equity/inclusion in astronomy, with successful
outcomes for 373 UAT students (39% women; ~30% members of underrepresented
groups) and 34 faculty (44% women). The UAT model is adaptable to many large
scientific projects and can be supported by relatively modest funding. We
recommend that granting agencies identify funding resources to support the
model, either as an add-on to legacy grant support or as a stand-alone funding
source. This could include encouragement of UAT-like components in large scale
projects currently being developed, such as the LSST and TMT. By doing this, we
will recognize the high numbers of astronomy research-trained
heavy-teaching-load faculty at PUIs as an under-utilized resource of the
astronomy community (see also White Paper by Ribaudo et al.). These members of
our community have the skills and the strong desire to contribute meaningfully
to their field, as well as the ability to encourage and interact closely with

"Title:Magnification, dust and time-delay constraints from the first resolved strongly lensed Type Ia supernova","
Abstract:  We report lensing magnifications, extinction, and time-delay estimates for
the first resolved, multiply-imaged Type Ia supernova iPTF16geu, at $z =
0.409$, using $Hubble\,Space\,Telescope$ ($HST$) observations in combination
with supporting ground-based data. Multi-band photometry of the resolved images
provides unique information about the differential dimming due to dust in the
lensing galaxy. Using $HST$ and Keck AO reference images taken after the SN
faded, we obtain a total lensing magnification for iPTF16geu of $\mu =
67.8^{+2.6}_{-2.9}$, accounting for extinction in the host and lensing galaxy.
As expected from the symmetry of the system, we measure very short time-delays
for the three fainter images with respect to the brightest one: -0.23 $\pm$
0.99, -1.43 $\pm$ 0.74 and 1.36 $\pm$ 1.07 days. Interestingly, we find large
differences between the magnifications of the four supernova images, even after
accounting for uncertainties in the extinction corrections: $\Delta m_1 =
-3.88^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, $\Delta m_2 = -2.99^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$, $\Delta m_3 =
-2.19^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ and $\Delta m_4 = -2.40^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$ mag, discrepant
with model predictions suggesting similar image brightnesses. A possible
explanation for the large differences is gravitational lensing by
substructures, micro- or millilensing, in addition to the large scale lens
causing the image separations. We find that the inferred magnification is
insensitive to the assumptions about the dust properties in the host and lens
galaxy.

Title:Searching for Wide Companions and Identifying Circum(sub)stellar Disks through PSF-Fitting of Spitzer/IRAC Archival Images,"
Abstract:  Direct imaging surveys have discovered wide-orbit planetary-mass companions
that challenge existing models of both star and planet formation, but their
demographics remain poorly sampled. We have developed an automated binary
companion point spread function (PSF) fitting pipeline to take advantage of
Spitzer's infrared sensitivity to planetary-mass objects and circum(sub)stellar
disks, measuring photometry across the four IRAC channels of 3.6 $\mu$m, 4.5
$\mu$m, 5.8 $\mu$m, and 8.0 $\mu$m. We present PSF-fitting photometry of
archival Spitzer/IRAC images for 11 young, low-mass ($M\sim0.044$-0.88
$M_{\odot}$; M7.5-K3.5) members of three nearby star-forming regions
(Chameleon, Taurus, and Upper Scorpius; $d\sim$ 150 pc; $\tau\sim$ 1-10 Myr)
that host confirmed or candidate faint companions at $\rho =
1.68^{\prime\prime}-7.31^{\prime\prime}$. We recover all system primaries, six
confirmed, and two candidate low-mass companions in our sample. We also measure
non-photospheric $[3.6]-[8.0]$ colors for three of the system primaries, four
of the confirmed companions, and one candidate companion, signifying the
presence of circumstellar or circum(sub)stellar disks. We furthermore report
the confirmation of a $\rho=4.66^{\prime\prime}$ (540 au) companion to [SCH06]
J0359+2009 which was previously identified as a candidate via imaging over five
years ago, but was not studied further. Based on its brightness
($M_{[3.6]}=8.53$ mag), we infer the companion mass to be $M=20\pm5$
$M_\mathrm{Jup}$ given the primary's model-derived age of 10 Myr. Our framework
is sensitive to companions with masses less than 10 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ at
separations of $\rho = 300$ au in nearby star-forming regions, opening up a new
regime of parameter space that has yet to be studied in detail, discovering
planetary-mass companions in their birth environments and revealing their
circum(sub)stellar disks.

Abstract:  Proton-proton interaction and photo-hadronic interaction in cosmic

the collision between UHE proton with magnetic field which could be considered
as the virtualphoton in the rest frame of UHE proton. We name this as $pB$
process. The threshold for the occurrence of the $pB$ process is that the
combination of the Lorentz factor of proton and the strength of the magnetic
field is about $\gamma_p B \simeq 5\times 10^{18}$Gauss. Beyond this threshold,
the rate of energy loss of proton due to the $pB$ process is about three orders
higher than that due to the synchrotron radiation of proton in the same
magnetic field. The $pB$ process might potentially happen in the atmosphere of
white dwarfs, neutron stars or even that of stellar massive black holes.

Title:Clumpy galaxies in cosmological simulations: The effect of ISM model,"
Abstract:  We study influence by models of inter-stellar medium (ISM) on properties of
galaxies in cosmological simulations. We examine three models widely used in
previous studies. The ISM models impose different equations of state on dense
gas. Using zoom-in simulations, we demonstrate that switching the ISM models
can control formation of giant clumps in massive discs at redshifts
$z\sim1$--$2$ while their initial conditions and the other settings such as
stellar feedback are unchanged. Thus, not only feedback but ISM models can also
be responsible for clumpy morphologies of simulated galaxies. We find, however,
that changing the ISM models hardly affects global properties of galaxies, such
as the total stellar and gas masses, star formation rate, metallicity and
stellar angular momentum, irrespective of the significant difference of
clumpiness; namely the ISM models only change clumpiness of discs. In addition,
our approach provides a test to investigate impact by clump formation on the
evolution of disc galaxies using the same initial conditions and feedback. We
find that clump formation does not significantly alter the properties of
galaxies and therefore could not be the causes of starburst or quenching.

Title:Strong gravitational lensing of explosive transients,"
Abstract:  Recent rapid progress in time domain surveys makes it possible to detect
various types of explosive transients in the Universe in large numbers, some of
which will be gravitationally lensed into multiple images. Although a large
number of strongly lensed distant galaxies and quasars have already been
discovered, strong lensing of explosive transients opens up new applications,
including improved measurements of cosmological parameters, powerful probes of
small scale structure of the Universe, and new observational tests of dark
matter scenarios, thanks to their rapidly evolving light curves as well as
their compact sizes. In particular, compact sizes of emitting regions of these
transient events indicate that wave optics effects play an important role in
some cases, which can lead to totally new applications of these lensing events.
Recently we have witnessed first discoveries of strongly lensed supernovae, and
strong lensing events of other types of explosive transients such as gamma-ray
bursts, fast radio bursts, and gravitational waves from compact binary mergers
are expected to be observed soon. In this review article, we summarize the
current state of research on strong gravitational lensing of explosive
transients and discuss future prospects.

Abstract:  We investigate the merging rates of compact binaries in galaxies, and the
related detection rate of gravitational wave (GW) events with AdvLIGO/Virgo and

ingredients: (i) the redshift-dependent galaxy statistics provided by the
latest determination of the star formation rate functions from
UV+far-IR/(sub)millimeter/radio data; (ii) star formation and chemical
enrichment histories for individual galaxies, modeled on the basis of
observations; (iii) compact remnant mass distribution and prescriptions for
merging of compact binaries from stellar evolution simulations. We present
results for the intrinsic birthrate of compact remnants, the merging rates of
compact binaries, GW detection rates and GW counts, attempting to differentiate
the outcomes among BH-BH, NS-NS, and BH-NS mergers, and to estimate their
occurrence in disk and spheroidal host galaxies. We compare our approach with
the one based on cosmic SFR density and cosmic metallicity, exploited by many
literature studies; the merging rates from the two approaches are in agreement
within the overall astrophysical uncertainties. We also investigate the effects
of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing of GW in enhancing the rate of
detectable events toward high-redshift. Finally, we discuss the contribution of
undetected GW emission from compact binary mergers to the stochastic
background.

dedicated to monitoring the transient gamma-ray sky in the energy range from 10
keV to 2 MeV using scintillation detectors onboard CubeSats in low Earth

local universe. The scientific goal of GRID is, in synergy with ground-based
gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO, to accumulate a
sample of GRBs associated with the merger of two compact stars and study jets
and related physics of those objects. It also involves observing and studying
other gamma-ray transients such as long GRBs, soft gamma-ray repeaters,
terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, and solar flares. With multiple CubeSats in
various orbits, GRID is unaffected by the Earth occultation and serves as a
full-time and all-sky monitor. Assuming a horizon of 200 Mpc for ground-based
GW detectors, we expect to see a few associated GW-GRB events per year. With
about 10 CubeSats in operation, GRID is capable of localizing a faint GRB like
170817A with a 90% error radius of about 10 degrees, through triangulation and
flux modulation. GRID is proposed and developed by students, with considerable

Title:207 New Open Star Clusters within 1 kpc from Gaia Data Release 2,"
Abstract:  We conducted a survey of open clusters within 1 kpc from the Sun using the
astrometric and photometric data of the Gaia Data Release 2. We found 655
cluster candidates by visual inspection of the stellar distributions in proper
motion space and spatial distributions in l-b space. All of the 655 cluster
candidates have a well defined main-sequence except for two candidates if we
consider that the main sequence of very young clusters is somewhat broad due to
differential extinction. Cross-matching of our 653 open clusters with known
open clusters in various catalogs resulted in 207 new open clusters. We present
the physical properties of the newly discovered open clusters. The majority of
the newly discovered open clusters are of young to intermediate age and have
less than ~50 member stars.

Title:A comparison between the two lobes of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko based on D/H ratios in H2O measured with the Rosetta/ROSINA DFMS,"
Abstract:  The nucleus of the Jupiter-family comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was
discovered to be bi-lobate in shape when the European Space Agency spacecraft
Rosetta first approached it in July 2014. The bi-lobate structure of the
cometary nucleus has led to much discussion regarding the possible manner of
its formation and on how the composition of each lobe might compare with that
of the other. During its two-year-long mission from 2014 to 2016, Rosetta
remained in close proximity to 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, studying its coma and
nucleus in situ. Based on lobe-specific measurements of HDO and H2O performed
with the ROSINA DFMS mass spectrometer on board Rosetta, the
Deuterium-to-Hydrogen ratios in water from the two lobes could be compared. No
appreciable difference was observed, suggesting that both lobes formed in the
same region and are homogeneous in their Deuterium-to-Hydrogen ratios.

Title:Bounds on WIMP dark matter from galaxy clusters at low redshift,"
Abstract:  The study of the cross-correlation angular power spectrum between
gravitational tracers and electromagnetic signals can be a powerful tool to
constrain Dark Matter (DM) microscopic properties. In this work we correlate
\Fermi\ diffuse \g-ray maps with catalogues of galaxy clusters. To emphasize
the sensitivity to a DM signal, we select clusters at low-redshift $0<z<0.2$
and with large-halo mass $M_{500}>10^{13}M_\odot$. The analysis is performed
with four catalogues in different wavebands, including infrared, optical and
X-rays. No evidence for a DM signal is identified. On the other hand, we derive
competitive bounds: the thermal cross-section is excluded at 95\% C.L. for DM
masses below 20 GeV and annihilation in the $\tau^+-\tau^-$ channel.

Title:Stable attitude dynamics of planar helio-stable and drag-stable sails,"
Abstract:  In this paper the planar orbit and attitude dynamics of an uncontrolled
spacecraft is studied, taking on-board a deorbiting device. Solar and drag
sails with the same shape are considered and separately studied. In both cases,
these devices are assumed to have a simplified pyramidal shape that endows the
spacecraft with helio and drag stable properties. The translational dynamics is
assumed to be planar and hence the rotational dynamics occurs only around one
of the principal axes of the spacecraft. Stable or slowly-varying attitudes are
studied, subject to disturbances due to the Earth oblateness effect and gravity
gradient torques, and either solar radiation pressure or atmospheric drag
torque and acceleration. The results are analysed with respect to the aperture
of the sail and the center of mass - center of pressure offset.

Title:Significance of bar quenching in the global quenching of star formation,"
Abstract:  The suppression of star formation in the inner kiloparsec regions of barred
disk galaxies due to the action of bars is known as bar quenching. We
investigate here the significance of bar quenching in the global quenching of
star formation in the barred galaxies and their transformation to passive
galaxies in the local Universe. We do this by measuring the offset of quenched
barred galaxies from star-forming main sequence galaxies in the star formation
rate-stellar mass plane and comparing it with the length of the bar, which is
considered as a proxy of bar quenching. We constructed the star formation
rate-stellar mass plane of 2885 local Universe face-on strong barred disk
galaxies ($z<0.06$) identified by Galaxy Zoo. The barred disk galaxies studied
here fall on the star formation main sequence relation with a significant
scatter for galaxies above stellar mass 10$^{10.2}$ M$\odot$. We found that
34.97 $\%$ galaxies are within the intrinsic scatter (0.3 dex) of the main
sequence relation, with a starburst population of 10.78 $\%$ (above the 0.3
dex) and a quenched population of 54.25 $\%$ (below the -0.3 dex) of the total
barred disk galaxies in our sample. Significant neutral hydrogen (M$_{HI}$
>10$^{9}$ M$\odot$ with log M$_{HI}$/M$\star$ $\sim$ -1.0 to -0.5) is detected
in the quenched barred galaxies with a similar gas content to that of the
star-forming barred galaxies. We found that the offset of the quenched barred
galaxies from the main sequence relation is not dependent on the length of the
stellar bar. This implies that the bar quenching may not contribute
significantly to the global quenching of star formation in barred galaxies.
However, this observed result could also be due to other factors such as the
dissolution of bars over time after star formation quenching, the effect of
other quenching processes acting simultaneously, and/or the effects of
environment.

Title:Convolutional neural network classifier for the output of the time-domain F-statistic all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves,"
Abstract:  Among astrophysical sources in the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo
detectors' frequency band are rotating non-axisymmetric neutron stars emitting
long-lasting, almost-monochromatic gravitational waves. Searches for these
continuous gravitational-wave signals are usually performed in long stretches
of data in a matched-filter framework e.g., the F-statistic method. In an
all-sky search for a priori unknown sources, large number of templates is
matched against the data using a pre-defined grid of variables (the
gravitational-wave frequency and its derivatives, sky coordinates),
subsequently producing a collection of candidate signals, corresponding to the
grid points at which the signal reaches a pre-defined signal-to-noise
threshold. An astrophysical signature of the signal is encoded in the
multi-dimensional vector distribution of the candidate signals. In the first
work of this kind, we apply a deep learning approach to classify the
distributions. We consider three basic classes: Gaussian noise, astrophysical
gravitational-wave signal, and a constant-frequency detector artifact
(""stationary line""), the two latter injected into the Gaussian noise. 1D and 2D
versions of a convolutional neural network classifier are implemented, trained
and tested on a broad range of signal frequencies. We demonstrate that these
implementations correctly classify the instances of data at various
signal-to-noise ratios and signal frequencies, while also showing concept
generalization i.e., satisfactory performance at previously unseen frequencies.
In addition we discuss the deficiencies, computational requirements and
possible applications of these implementations.

Abstract:  Electromagnetic-Cascades (EmCa) is a Python package for the simulation of
electromagnetic cascades in various materials. The showers are modeled using

advantage of being computationally inexpensive and fast, unlike Monte Carlo

high range of validity of the simulation results. EmCa is easily extendable and

Title:Generic energy transport solutions to the solar abundance problem -- a hint of new physics,"
Abstract:  First, we briefly review the solar abundance problem and its current status.
We start with the description of the existing theoretical model of the Sun and
its main uncertainties and proceed with the discussion of the observational
evidence for the anomaly. We conclude the review part by outlining the main
approaches to solving the solar abundance problem investigated before. In the
second part of the paper we consider the poorly studied before non-diffusive
energy transport solutions to the problem. We calculate the additional energy
flux inside the Sun evidenced by the combined data from helioseismology,
spectroscopy and solar neutrino detection experiments. Our findings suggest
that the solar abundance problem can be solved by a localized loss of energy
near the radiative zone boundary and a gain of approximately the same amount of
energy inside the solar core ($0.1R_{\odot} \lesssim r \lesssim 0.3R_{\odot}$).
We show that if the localized loss of energy is associated with the resonant
emission of transversely polarized hidden photons, the kinetic mixing parameter
required does not contradict any of the existing constraints, the ones from the
Sun being relaxed as long as the energy loss is compensated by energy
deposition inside the core. We introduce then the light dark fermions coupled
to hidden photons and discuss their interactions with the solar plasma. We find
the distribution of these dark particles inside the inner part of the radiative
zone which is required to provide the necessary heating of the core.

Abstract:  The James Webb Space Telescope will provide deep imaging and spectroscopy for
sources at redshifts above 6, covering the Epoch of Reionization (EoR, 6 < z <

only instrument on board JWST able to observe the brightest optical emission
lines H$\alpha$ and [OIII]0.5007$\mu$m at redshifts above 7 and 9,
respectively. This paper presents a study of the H$\alpha$ fluxes predicted by
FIRSTLIGHT cosmological simulations for galaxies at redshifts of 6.5 to 10.5,
and its detectability with MIRI. Deep (40 ks) spectroscopic integrations with
MRS will be able to detect (S/N > 5) EoR sources at redshifts above 7 with
intrinsic star formation rates of more than 2 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and
stellar masses above 4-9 $\times$ 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$. In addition, the paper
presents realistic MRS simulated observations of the expected (rest-frame)
optical and near-infrared spectra for some spectroscopically confirmed EoR
sources detected by ALMA as [OIII]88$\mu$m emitters. The MRS simulated spectra
cover a wide range of low metallicities from about 0.2 to 0.02Z$_{\odot}$, and
different [OIII]88$\mu$m/[OIII]0.5007$\mu$m line ratios. The simulated 10ks MRS
spectra show S/N in the range of 5 to 90 for H$\beta$,
[OIII]0.4959,0.5007$\mu$m, H$\alpha$ and HeI1.083$\mu$m emission lines of
MACS1149-JD1 at z = 9.11, independent of metallicity. In addition, deep 40 ks
simulated spectra of the luminous merger candidate B14-65666 at z=7.15 shows
the MRS capabilities of detecting, or putting strong upper limits, on the

properties like internal extinction, instantaneous star formation, hardness of
the ionising continuum, and metallicity, in bright (intrinsic or lensed) EoR

Title:Acoustic wave generation in collapsing massive stars with convective shells,"
Abstract:  The convection that takes place in the innermost shells of massive stars
plays an important role in the formation of core-collapse supernova explosions.
Upon encountering the supernova shock, additional turbulence is generated,
amplifying the explosion. In this work, we study how the convective
perturbations evolve during the stellar collapse. Our main aim is to establish
their physical properties right before they reach the supernova shock. To this
end, we solve the linearized hydrodynamics equations perturbed on a stationary
background flow. The latter is approximated by the spherical transonic Bondi
accretion, while the convective perturbations are modeled as a combination of
entropy and vorticity waves. We follow their evolution from large radii, where
convective shells are initially located, down to small radii, where they are
expected to encounter the accretion shock above the proto-neutron star.
Considering typical vorticity perturbations with a Mach number $\sim 0.1$ and
entropy perturbations with magnitude $\sim 0.05 k_\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{baryon}$,
we find that the advection of these perturbations down to the shock generates
acoustic waves with a relative amplitude $\delta p/\gamma p \lesssim 10\%$, in
agreement with published numerical simulations. The velocity perturbations
consist of contributions from acoustic and vorticity waves with values reaching
$\sim 10\%$ of the sound speed ahead of the shock. The perturbation amplitudes
decrease with increasing $\ell$ and initial radii of the convective shells.

Abstract:  We present observations of the CO isotopologues ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and
C$^{18}$O) toward the Galactic region with $169\arcdeg.75 \leqslant l \leqslant

Purple Mountain Observatory 13.7~m millimeter-wavelength telescope. Based on
the $^{13}$CO~($J = 1-0$) data, we find five molecular clouds within the
velocity range between $-$25 and 8~km~s$^{-1}$ that are all characterized by
conspicuous filamentary structures. We have identified eight filaments with a
length of 6.38--28.45~pc, a mean H$_2$ column density of
0.70$\times$10$^{21}$--6.53$\times$10$^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$, and a line mass of
20.24--161.91~$M_\sun$ pc$^{-1}$, assuming a distance of $\sim$1.7~kpc.
Gaussian fittings to the inner parts of the radial density profiles lead to a
mean FWHM width of 1.13$\pm$0.01~pc. The velocity structures of most filaments
present continuous distributions with slight velocity gradients. We find that
turbulence is the dominant internal pressure to support the fragmentation of
filaments instead of thermal pressure. Most filaments have virial parameters
smaller than 2; thus, they are gravitationally bound. Four filaments have an
LTE line mass close to the virial line mass. We further extract dense clumps
using the $^{13}$CO data and find that 64$\%$ of the clumps are associated with
the filaments. According to the complementary IR data, most filaments have
associated Class~II young stellar objects. Class~I objects are mainly found to
be located in the filaments with a virial parameter close to 1. Within two
virialized filaments, $^{12}$CO outflows have been detected, indicating ongoing

estimate probabilities and hence that luminosity curve. We carry out
statistical tests to evaluate our results. The resulting luminosity function
compares well to earlier determinations. And our results remain consistent
either when the amount or choice of sampled sources is unbiasedly altered.
Besides this we estimate the distribution of the luminosity function for

Title:Coronagraphic phase diversity through residual turbulence: performance study and experimental validation,"
Abstract:  Quasi-static aberrations in coronagraphic systems are the ultimate limitation
to the capabilities of exoplanet imagers both ground-based and space-based.
These aberrations - which can be due to various causes such as optics alignment
or moving optical parts during the observing sequence - create light residuals
called speckles in the focal plane that might be mistaken for a planets. For
ground-based instruments, the presence of residual turbulent wavefront errors
due to partial adaptive optics correction causes an additional difficulty to
the challenge of measuring aberrations in the presence of a coronagraph. In
this paper, we present an extension of COFFEE, the coronagraphic phase
diversity, to the estimation of quasi-static aberrations in the presence of
adaptive optics-corrected residual turbulence. We perform realistic numerical
simulations to assess the performance that can be expected on an instrument of
the current generation. We perform the first experimental validation in the
laboratory which demonstrates that quasistatic aberrations can be corrected
during the observations by means of coronagraphic phase diversity.

galaxy Zw 229.015 using multi-epoch, multi-instrument and deep pointed
observations with XMM-Newton, Suzaku, Swift and NuSTAR. Spectral and temporal
variability are examined in detail on both the long (weeks-to-years) and short
(hours) timescales. A deep Suzaku observation of the source shows two distinct
spectral states; a bright-soft state and a dim-hard state in which changes in
the power law component account for the differences. Partial covering, blurred
reflection and soft Comptonisation models describe the X-ray spectra comparably
well, but the smooth, rather featureless, spectrum may be favouring the soft
Comptonisation scenario. Moreover, independent of the spectral model, the
observed spectral variability is ascribed to the changes in the power law
continuum only and do not require changes in the properties of the absorber or
blurred reflector incorporated in the other scenarios. The multi-epoch
observations between 2009 and 2018 can be described in similar fashion. This
could be understood if the primary emission is originating at a large distance
from a standard accretion disc or if the disc is optically thin and
geometrically thick as recently proposed for Zw 229.015. Our investigation
shows that Zw 229.015 behaves similar to sources like Akn 120 and Mrk 530, that
exhibit a strong soft-excess, but weak Compton hump and Fe K${\alpha}$
emission.

Title:Spectral analysis of the hybrid PG 1159-type central stars of the planetary nebulae Abell 43 and NGC 7094,"
Abstract:  Stellar post asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) evolution can be completely
altered by a final thermal pulse (FTP) which may occur when the star is still
leaving the AGB (AFTP), at the departure from the AGB at still constant
luminosity (late TP, LTP) or after the entry to the white-dwarf cooling
sequence (very late TP, VLTP). Then convection mixes the He-rich material with
the H-rich envelope. According to stellar evolution models the result is a star
with a surface composition of $\mathrm{H}\approx\,20\,$% by mass (AFTP),
$\approx 1\,$% (LTP), or (almost) no H (VLTP). Since FTP stars exhibit
intershell material at their surface, spectral analyses establish constraints
for AGB nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution. We performed a spectral analysis
of the so-called hybrid PG 1159-type central stars (CS) of the planetary
nebulae Abell 43 and NGC7094 by means of non-local thermodynamical equilibrium
models. We confirm the previously determined effective temperatures of
$T_\mathrm{eff} = 115\,000\pm 5\,000\,$K and determine surface gravities of
$\log (g\,/\,\mathrm{cm/s^2}) = 5.6\pm 0.1$ for both. From a comparison with
AFTP evolutionary tracks, we derive stellar masses of
$0.57^{+0.07}_{-0.04}\,M_\odot$ and determine the abundances of H, He, and
metals up to Xe. Both CS are likely AFTP stars with a surface H mass fraction
of $0.25 \pm 0.03$ and $0.15 \pm 0.03$, respectively, and a Fe deficiency
indicating subsolar initial metallicities. The light metals show typical PG
1159-type abundances and the elemental composition is in good agreement with
predictions from AFTP evolutionary models. However, the expansion ages do not
agree with evolution timescales expected from the AFTP scenario and
alternatives should be explored.

Title:Damping of slow magnetoacoustic oscillations by the misbalance between heating and cooling processes in the solar corona,"
Abstract:  Rapidly decaying slow magnetoacoustic waves are regularly observed in the
solar coronal structures, offering a promising tool for a seismological
diagnostics of the coronal plasma, including its thermodynamical properties.
The effect of damping of standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in the
solar coronal loops is investigated accounting for the field-aligned thermal
conductivity and a wave-induced misbalance between radiative cooling and some
unspecified heating rates. The non-adiabatic terms were allowed to be
arbitrarily large, corresponding to the observed values. The thermal
conductivity was taken in its classical form, and a power-law dependence of the
heating function on the density and temperature was assumed. The analysis was
conducted in the linear regime and in the infinite magnetic field
approximation. The wave dynamics is found to be highly sensitive to the
characteristic time scales of the thermal misbalance. Depending on certain
values of the misbalance time scales three regimes of the wave evolution were
identified, namely the regime of a suppressed damping, enhanced damping where
the damping rate drops down to the observational values, and acoustic
over-stability. The specific regime is determined by the dependences of the
radiative cooling and heating functions on thermodynamical parameters of the
plasma in the vicinity of the perturbed thermal equilibrium. The comparison of
the observed and theoretically derived decay times and oscillation periods
allows us to constrain the coronal heating function. For typical coronal
parameters, the observed properties of standing slow magnetoacoustic
oscillations could be readily reproduced with a reasonable choice of the
heating function.

Title:3D MHD simulations and synthetic radio emission from an oblique rotating magnetic massive star,"
Abstract:  We have performed 3D isothermal MHD simulation of a magnetic rotating massive
star with a non-zero dipole obliquity and predicted the radio/sub-mm observable
lightcurves and continuum spectra for a frequency range compatible with ALMA.
From these results we also compare the model input mass-loss to that calculated
from the synthetic thermal emission. Spherical and cylindrical symmetry is
broken due to the obliquity of the stellar magnetic dipole resulting in an
inclination and phase dependence of both the spectral flux and inferred
mass-loss rate, providing testable predictions of variability for oblique
rotator. Both quantities vary by factors between 2 and 3 over a full rotational
period of the star, demonstrating that the role of rotation as critical in
understanding the emission. This illustrates the divergence from a symmetric
wind, resulting in a two armed spiral structure indicative of a oblique
magnetic rotator. We show that a constant spectral index, $\alpha$, model
agrees well with our numerical prediction for a spherical wind for
$\nu~<~10^{3} \ \mathrm{GHz}$, however it is unable to capture the behavior of
emission at $\nu~>~10^{3} \ \mathrm{GHz}$. As such we caution the use of such
constant $\alpha$ models for predicting emission from non-spherical winds such
as those which form around magnetic massive stars.

Title:Warped diffusive radio halo around the quiescent spiral edge-on galaxy NGC 4565,"
Abstract:  Cosmic rays play a pivotal role in launching galactic winds, particularly in
quiescently star-forming galaxies where the hot gas alone is not sufficient to
drive a wind. Except for the Milky Way, not much is known about the transport
of cosmic rays in galaxies. In this Letter, we present low-frequency
observations of the nearby edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4565 using the
LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR). With our deep 144-MHz observations, we obtain a
clean estimate of the emission originating from old cosmic-ray electrons (CRe),
which is almost free from contamination by thermal emission. We measured
vertical profiles of the non-thermal radio continuum emission that we fitted
with Gaussian and exponential functions. The different profile shapes
correspond to 1D cosmic-ray transport models of pure diffusion and advection,
respectively. We detect a warp in the radio continuum that is reminiscent of
the previously known HI warp. Because the warp is not seen at GHz-frequencies
in the radio continuum, its minimum age must be about 100 Myr. The warp also
explains the slight flaring of the thick radio disc that can otherwise be well
described by a Gaussian profile with an FWHM of 65 arcsec (3.7 kpc). The
diffusive radio halo together with the extra-planar X-ray emission may be
remnants of enhanced star-forming activity in the past where the galaxy had a
galactic wind, as GHz-observations indicate only a weak outflow in the last 40
Myr. NGC 4565 could be in transition from an outflow- to an inflow-dominated
phase.

Title:Contribution of magnetism to the Saturn rings origin,"
Abstract:  The magnetization relationships for magnetically uniform spherical particles
of the Saturn rings are derived. The problem of a solitary magnetized sphere
and spherical particle among identical particles scattered in a disk-like
structure is solved. The differential equations of motion of particles in the
gravitational and magnetic field are derived. Special cases of these equations
are solved exactly, and their solutions suggest that the superposition of the
gravitational attraction and repulsion by a magnetic field of the iced
particles which possess diamagnetism can account for the stability of Saturn
rings.

"Title:ALMA Detection of Vibrationally Excited ($v\mathrm{_t} = 1,2$) Acetic Acid toward NGC 6334I","
Abstract:  Vibrationally excited states of detected interstellar molecules have been
shown to account for a large portion of unidentified spectral lines in observed
interstellar spectra toward chemically rich sources. Here, we present the first
interstellar detection of the first and second vibrationally excited torsional
states of acetic acid ($v_\mathrm{t} = 1, 2$) toward the high-mass star-forming
region NGC 6334I. The observations presented were taken with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array in bands 4, 6, and 7 covering a frequency range
of 130 - 352 GHz. By comparing a single excitation temperature model to the
observations, the best-fit excitation temperature and column density are
obtained to be 142(25) K and $1.12(7) \times 10^{17} \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$
respectively. Based on the intensity maps of the vibrationally excited
CH$_3$COOH transitions, we found that the CH$_3$COOH emissions are compact and
concentrated toward the MM1 and MM2 regions with a source size smaller than 2
arcsec. After locating the emission from different CH$_3$COOH transitions,
which cover a large range of excitation energies, we are able to explain the
variation of the CH$_3$COOH emission peak within the MM2 core by invoking
continuum absorption or outflows.

Title:Effect of the Solar dark matter wake on planets,"
Abstract:  The Galaxy is conventionally thought to be surrounded by a massive dark
matter (DM) halo. As the Sun goes through this halo, it excites a DM wake
behind it. This local asymmetry in the DM distribution would gravitationally
affect the motions of Solar System planets, potentially allowing the DM wake to
be detected or ruled out. Hernandez (2019) recently calculated that the
DM-induced perturbation to Saturn's position is 252 metres net of the effect on
the Sun. No such anomaly is seen in Saturn's motion despite very accurate
tracking of the Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn for >13 years. Here,
we revisit the calculation of how much Saturn would deviate from Keplerian
motion if we fix its position and velocity at some particular time. The DM wake
induces a nearly resonant perturbation whose amplitude grows almost linearly
with time. We show that the Hernandez (2019) result applies only for an
observing duration comparable to the ${\approx 250}$ million year period of the
Sun's orbit around the Galaxy. Over a 100 year period, the perturbation to
Saturn's orbit amounts to <1 cm, which is quite consistent with existing
observations. Even smaller perturbations are expected for the terrestrial
planets.

Abstract:  Studies on the massive star population in galaxies beyond the Local Group are
the key to understand the link between their numbers and modes of star
formation in different environments. We present the analysis of the massive
star population of the galaxies NGC 1326A, NGC 1425 and NGC 4548 using archival
Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images in the F555W and
F814W filters. Through high precision point spread function fitting photometry
for all sources in the three fields we identified 7640 candidate blue
supergiants, 2314 candidate yellow supergiants, and 4270 candidate red
supergiants. We provide an estimation the ratio of blue to red supergiants for
each field as a function of galactocentric radius. Using Modules for
Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) at solar metallicity, we defined the
luminosity function and estimated the star formation history of each galaxy. We
carried out a variability search in the V and I filters using three variability
indexes: the median absolute deviation, the interquartile range, and the
inverse von-Neumann ratio. This analysis yielded 243 new variable candidates
with absolute magnitudes ranging from Mv= -4 to -10 mag. We classified the
variable stars based on their absolute magnitude and their position on the
color-magnitude diagram using the MESA evolutionary tracks at solar
metallicity. Our analysis yielded 8 candidate variable blue supergiants, 12
candidate variable yellow supergiants, 21 candidate variable red supergiants,

Title:Discovery of a very hot phase of the Milky Way CGM with non-solar abundance ratios,"
Abstract:  We present the discovery of a very hot gas phase of the Milky Way
circumgalactic medium (CGM) at T $\approx 10^7$ K, using deep XMM-Newton RGS
observations of 1ES 1553+113. The hot gas, coexisting with a warm-hot phase at
T $\approx 10^6$ K is $\alpha-$enhanced, with [O/Fe] = 0.9$^{+0.7}_{-0.3}$,
indicating core-collapse supernovae enrichment. Additionally we find [Ne/O] and
[N/O] = $0.7^{+1.6}_{-0.2}$, such that N/Ne is consistent with solar. Along
with the enrichment by AGB stars and core-collapse supernovae, this indicates
that some oxygen has depleted onto dust and/or transited to cooler gas
phase(s). These results may affect previous baryonic and metallic mass
estimations of the warm-hot and hot CGM from the observations of oxygen
emission and absorption. Our results provide insights on the heating, mixing
and chemical enrichment of the Milky Way CGM, and provide inputs to theoretical
models of galaxy evolution.

Title:Magnetic Inflation and Stellar Mass IV. Four Low-mass Kepler Eclipsing Binaries Consistent with Non-magnetic Stellar Evolutionary Models,"
Abstract:  Low-mass eclipsing binaries show systematically larger radii than model
predictions for their mass, metallicity and age. Prominent explanations for the
inflation involve enhanced magnetic fields generated by rapid rotation of the
star that inhibit convection and/or suppress flux from the star via starspots.
However, derived masses and radii for individual eclipsing binary systems often
disagree in the literature. In this paper, we continue to investigate low-mass
eclipsing binaries (EBs) observed by NASA's {\it Kepler} spacecraft, deriving
stellar masses and radii using high-quality space-based light curves and radial
velocities from high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We report masses and
radii for three {\it Kepler} EBs, two of which agree with previously published
masses and radii (KIC 11922782 and KIC 9821078). For the third EB (KIC
7605600), we report new masses and show the secondary component is likely fully
convective ($M_2 = 0.17 \pm 0.01 M_{\sun}$ and $R_2 = 0.199^{+0.001}_{-0.002}
R_{\sun}$). Combined with KIC 10935310 from Han et al. (2017), we find that the
masses and radii for four low-mass {\it Kepler} EBs are consistent with modern
stellar evolutionary models for M dwarf stars and do not require inhibited
convection by magnetic fields to account for the stellar radii.

Title:On the need for synthetic data and robust data simulators in the 2020s,"
Abstract:  As observational datasets become larger and more complex, so too are the
questions being asked of these data. Data simulations, i.e., synthetic data
with properties (pixelization, noise, PSF, artifacts, etc.) akin to real data,
are therefore increasingly required for several purposes, including: (1)
testing complicated measurement methods, (2) comparing models and astrophysical
simulations to observations in a manner that requires as few assumptions about
the data as possible, (3) predicting observational results based on models and
astrophysical simulations for, e.g., proposal planning, and (4) mitigating risk
for future observatories and missions by effectively priming and testing
pipelines. We advocate for an increase in using synthetic data to plan for and
interpret real observations as a matter of routine. This will require funding
for (1) facilities to provide robust data simulators for their instruments,
telescopes, and surveys, and (2) making synthetic data publicly available in
archives (much like real data) so as to lower the barrier of entry to all.

Title:Hubble Space Telescope Imaging of Antlia B: Star Formation History and a New Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance,"
Abstract:  A census of the satellite population around dwarf galaxy primary hosts in
environments outside the Local Group is essential to understanding $\Lambda$CDM
galaxy formation and evolution on the smallest scales. We present deep optical
Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the gas-rich, faint dwarf galaxy Antlia B
($M_V = -9.4$) -- a likely satellite of NGC 3109 ($D = 1.3$ Mpc) -- discovered
as part of our ongoing survey of primary host galaxies similar to the
Magellanic Clouds. We derive a new tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distance
of $D = 1.35 \pm 0.06$ Mpc ($m-M = 25.65 \pm 0.10$), consistent with membership
in the nearby NGC 3109 dwarf association. The color-magnitude diagram shows
both a prominent old, metal-poor stellar component and confirms a small
population of young, blue stars with ages $\lesssim 1$ Gyr. We use the
color-magnitude diagram fitting algorithm MATCH to derive the star formation
history and find that it is consistent with the typical dwarf irregular or
transitional dwarf galaxy (dTrans) in the Local Group. Antlia B shows
relatively constant stellar mass growth for the first $\sim 10-11$ Gyr and
almost no growth in the last $\sim 2-3$ Gyr. Despite being gas-rich, Antlia B
shows no evidence of active star formation (i.e., no H$\alpha$ emission) and
should therefore be classified as a dTrans dwarf. Both Antlia B and the Antlia
dwarf (dTrans) are likely satellites of NGC 3109 suggesting that the cessation
of ongoing star formation in these galaxies may be environmentally driven.
Future work studying the gas kinematics and distribution in Antlia B will
explore this scenario in greater detail. Our work highlights the fact that
detailed studies of nearby dwarf galaxies in a variety of environments may
continue to shed light on the processes that drive the star formation history
and evolution of dwarf galaxies more generally.

Title:The MOSDEF Survey: Sulfur Emission-line Ratios Provide New Insights into Evolving ISM Conditions at High Redshift,"
Abstract:  We present results on the emission-line properties of 1.3<=z<=2.7 galaxies
drawn from the complete MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey.
Specifically, we use observations of the emission-line diagnostic diagram of
[OIII]5007/Hb vs. [SII]6717,6731/Ha, i.e., the ""[SII] BPT diagram,"" to gain
insight into the physical properties of high-redshift star-forming regions.
High-redshift MOSDEF galaxies are offset towards lower [SII]6717,6731/Ha at
fixed [OIII]5007/Hb, relative to local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). Furthermore, at fixed [OIII]5007/Hb, local SDSS galaxies follow
a trend of decreasing [SII]6717,6731/Ha as the surface density of star
formation (Sigma_SFR) increases. We explain this trend in terms of the
decreasing fractional contribution from diffuse ionized gas (f_DIG) as
Sigma_SFR increases in galaxies, which causes galaxy-integrated line ratios to
shift towards the locus of pure HII-region emission. The z~0 relationship
between f_DIG and Sigma_SFR implies that high-redshift galaxies have lower
f_DIG values than typical local systems, given their significantly higher
typical Sigma_SFR. When an appropriate low-redshift benchmark with zero or
minimal f_DIG is used, high-redshift MOSDEF galaxies appear offset towards
higher [SII]6717,6731/Ha and/or [OIII]5007/Hb. The joint shifts of
high-redshift galaxies in the [SII] and [NII] BPT diagrams are best explained
in terms of the harder spectra ionizing their star-forming regions at fixed
nebular oxygen abundance (expected for chemically-young galaxies), as opposed
to large variations in N/O ratios or higher ionization parameters. The evolving
mixture of HII regions and DIG is an essential ingredient to our description of
the ISM over cosmic time.

Title:Evidence for a Vast Prograde Stellar Stream in the Solar Vicinity,"
Abstract:  Massive dwarf galaxies that merge with the Milky Way on prograde orbits can
be dragged into the disk plane before being completely disrupted. Such mergers
can contribute to an accreted stellar disk and a dark matter disk. We present
evidence for Nyx, a vast new stellar stream in the vicinity of the Sun, that
may provide the first indication that such an event occurred in the Milky Way.
We identify about 500 stars that have coherent radial and prograde motion in
this stream using a catalog of accreted stars built by applying deep learning
methods to the second Gaia data release. Nyx is concentrated within $\pm 2$ kpc
of the Galactic midplane and spans the full radial range studied (6.5-9.5 kpc).
The kinematics of Nyx stars are distinct from those of both the thin and thick
disk. In particular, its rotational speed lags the disk by $\sim 80$ km/s and
its stars follow more eccentric orbits. A small number of Nyx stars have
chemical abundances or inferred ages; from these, we deduce that Nyx stars have
a peak metallicity of [Fe/H] $\sim -0.5$ and ages $\sim $10-13 Gyr. Taken
together with the kinematic observations, these results strongly favor the
interpretation that Nyx is the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. To further
justify this interpretation, we explicitly demonstrate that metal-rich,
prograde streams like Nyx can be found in the disk plane of Milky Way-like
galaxies using the FIRE hydrodynamic simulations. Future spectroscopic studies
will be able to validate whether Nyx stars originate from a single progenitor.

Title:A DECam Search for Explosive Optical Transients Associated with IceCube Neutrinos,"
Abstract:  In this work, we investigate the likelihood of association between realtime,
TeV-PeV energy neutrino alerts from IceCube and optical counterparts in the
form of core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe). The optical follow-up of IceCube
alerts requires two main instrumental capabilities: (1) deep imaging, since
73\% of neutrinos would come from CC SNe at redshifts $z > 0.3$, and (2) a
large field of view (FoV), since typical IceCube muon neutrino pointing
accuracy is on the order of $\sim1$~deg. With Blanco/DECam ($gri$ to 24th
magnitude and $2.2$~deg diameter FoV), we performed a triggered optical
follow-up observation of two IceCube alerts, IC170922A and IC171106A on
$\sim6$~nights during the $\sim3$~weeks following each alert. For the IC170922A
(IC171106A) follow-up observations, we expect that 12.1\% (9.5\%) of coincident
CC SNe at $z \lesssim 0.3$ are detectable, and that on average, 0.23 (0.07)
unassociated SNe in the neutrino 90\% containment regions also pass our
selection criteria. We find two candidate CC SNe that are temporally coincident
with the neutrino alerts in the FoV, but none in the 90\% containment regions,
which is statistically consistent with expected rates of background CC SNe for
these observations. If CC SNe are the dominant source of TeV-PeV neutrinos, we
would expect an excess of coincident CC SNe to be detectable at the $3\sigma$
confidence level using DECam observations similar to those of this work for
$\sim60$ ($\sim200$) neutrino alerts with (without) redshift information for
all candidates.

Title:FOBOS: A Next-Generation Spectroscopic Facility at the W. M. Keck Observatory,"
Abstract:  High-multiplex and deep spectroscopic follow-up of upcoming panoramic
deep-imaging surveys like LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST is a widely recognized and
increasingly urgent necessity. No current or planned facility at a U.S.
observatory meets the sensitivity, multiplex, and rapid-response time needed to
exploit these future datasets. FOBOS, the Fiber-Optic Broadband Optical
Spectrograph, is a near-term fiber-based facility that addresses these
spectroscopic needs by optimizing depth over area and exploiting the aperture
advantage of the existing 10m Keck II Telescope. The result is an instrument
with a uniquely blue-sensitive wavelength range (0.31-1.0 um) at R~3500,
high-multiplex (1800 fibers), and a factor 1.7 greater survey speed and
order-of-magnitude greater sampling density than Subaru's Prime Focus
Spectrograph (PFS). In the era of panoramic deep imaging, FOBOS will excel at
building the deep, spectroscopic reference data sets needed to interpret vast
imaging data. At the same time, its flexible focal plane, including a mode with
25 deployable integral-field units (IFUs) across a 20 arcmin diameter field,
enables an expansive range of scientific investigations. Its key programmatic
areas include (1) nested stellar-parameter training sets that enable studies of
the Milky Way and M31 halo sub-structure, as well as local group dwarf
galaxies, (2) a comprehensive picture of galaxy formation thanks to detailed
mapping of the baryonic environment at z~2 and statistical linking of evolving
populations to the present day, and (3) dramatic enhancements in cosmological
constraints via precise photometric redshifts and determined redshift
distributions. In combination with Keck I instrumentation, FOBOS also provides
instant access to medium-resolution spectroscopy for transient sources with
full coverage from the UV to the K-band.

Abstract:  We perform an independent search for annual modulation caused by dark
matter-induced scatterings in the recently released COSINE-100 data. We test
the hypothesis that the data contains a sinusoidal modulation against the null
hypothesis that the data consists of only background. We compare the
significance using frequentist, information theoretic techniques (such as AIC

information theory-based tests mildly prefer a constant background over a
sinusoidal signal with the same period as that found by the DAMA collaboration.
The Bayesian test however strongly prefers a background model. This is the
first proof of principles demonstration of application of Bayesian and

Title:Crust cooling of the neutron star in Aql X-1: Different depth and magnitude of shallow heating during similar accretion outbursts,"
Abstract:  The structure and composition of the crust of neutron stars plays an
important role in their thermal and magnetic evolution, hence in setting their
observational properties. One way to study the crust properties is to measure
how it cools after it has been heated during an accretion outburst in a
low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Such studies have shown that there is a
tantalizing source of heat, of currently unknown origin, that is located in the
outer layers of the crust and has a strength that varies between different
sources and different outbursts. With the aim of understanding the mechanism
behind this ""shallow heating"", we present Chandra and Swift observations of the
neutron star LMXB Aql X-1, obtained after its bright 2016 outburst. We find
that the neutron star temperature was initially much lower, and started to
decrease at much later time, than observed after the 2013 outburst of the
source, despite the fact that the properties of the two outbursts were very
similar. Comparing our data to thermal evolution simulations, we infer that the
depth and magnitude of shallow heating must have been much larger during the
2016 outburst than during the 2013 one. This implies that basic neutron star
parameters that do not change between outbursts, do not play a strong role in
shallow heating. Furthermore, it suggests that outbursts with a similar
accretion morphology can give rise to very different shallow heating. We also
discuss alternative explanations for the difference in quiescent evolution
after the 2016 outburst.

Title:The Peculiar Volatile Composition of CO-Dominated Comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS),"
Abstract:  Comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS) has a peculiar volatile composition, with CO
being the dominant volatile as opposed to H$_2$O and one of the largest
N$_2$/CO ratios ever observed in a comet. Using observations obtained with the
\textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}, NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, the
3.5-meter ARC telescope at Apache Point Observatory, the Discovery Channel
Telescope at Lowell Observatory, and the Arizona Radio Observatory 10-m
Submillimeter Telescope we quantified the abundances of 12 different species in
the coma of R2 PanSTARRS. We confirm the high abundances of CO and N$_2$ and
heavy depletions of H$_2$O, HCN, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO compared to CO reported
by previous studies. We provide the first measurements (or most sensitive
measurements/constraints) on H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, OCS,
C$_2$H$_2$, and NH$_3$, all of which are depleted relative to CO by at least
one to two orders of magnitude compared to values commonly observed in comets.
The observed species also show strong enhancements relative to H$_2$O, and even
when compared to other species like CH$_4$ or CH$_3$OH most species show
deviations from typical comets by at least a factor of two to three. The only
mixing ratios found to be close to typical are CH$_3$OH/CO$_2$ and
CH$_3$OH/CH$_4$. While R2 PanSTARRS was located at a heliocentric distance of
2.8 AU at the time of our observations in January/February 2018, we argue that
this alone cannot account for the peculiar observed composition of this comet
and therefore must reflect its intrinsic composition. We discuss possible
implications for this clear outlier in compositional studies of comets obtained
to date, and encourage future dynamical and chemical modeling in order to
better understand what the composition of R2 PanSTARRS tells us about the early
Solar System.

Abstract:  We are carrying out a sensitive blind survey for neutral hydrogen (HI) in the
Virgo cluster and report here on the first 5 x 1 area covered, which
includes two optically-dark gas features: the five-cloud ALFALFA Virgo 7
complex (Kent et al. 2007, 2009) and the stripped tail of NGC 4522 (Kenney et
al. 2004). We discover a sixth cloud and low velocity gas that extends the
velocity range of the complex to over 450 km/s, find that around half of the
total HI flux comes from extended emission rather than compact clouds, and see
around 150 percent more gas, raising the total HI mass from 5.1 x 10$^8$
M$_\odot$ to 1.3 x 10$^9$ M$_\odot$. This makes the identification of NGC 4445
and NGC 4424 by Kent et al. (2009) as possible progenitors of the complex less
likely, as it would require an unusually high fraction of the gas removed to
have been preserved in the complex. We also identify a new component to the gas
tail of NGC 4522 extending to ~200 km/s below the velocity range of the gas in
the galaxy, pointing towards the eastern end of the complex. We consider the
possibility that NGC 4522 may be the parent galaxy of the complex, but the
large velocity separation (~1800 km/s) leads us to rule this out. We conclude
that, in the absence of any better candidate, NGC 4445 remains the most likely
parent galaxy, although this requires it to have been particularly gas-rich
prior to the event that removed its gas into the complex.

"Title:Signatures of Tidal Disruption in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies: A Combined HST, Gaia, and MMT/Hectochelle Study of Leo V","
Abstract:  The ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Leo V has shown both photometric overdensities
and kinematic members at large radii, along with a tentative kinematic
gradient, suggesting that it may have undergone a close encounter with the
Milky Way. We investigate these signs of disruption through a combination of i)
high-precision photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), ii)
two epochs of stellar spectra obtained with the Hectochelle Spectrograph on the
MMT, and iii) measurements from the Gaia mission. Using the HST data, we
examine one of the reported stream-like overdensities at large radii, and
conclude that it is not a true stellar stream, but instead a clump of
foreground stars and background galaxies. Our spectroscopic analysis shows that
one known member star is likely a binary, and challenges the membership status
of three others, including two distant candidates that had formerly provided
evidence for overall stellar mass loss. We also find evidence that the proposed
kinematic gradient across Leo V might be due to small number statistics. We
update the systemic proper motion of Leo V, finding $(\mu_\alpha \cos\delta,
\mu_\delta)= (0.009\pm0.560$, $-0.777\pm0.314)$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which is
consistent with its reported orbit that did not put Leo V at risk of being
disturbed by the Milky Way. These findings remove most of the observational
clues that suggested Leo V was disrupting, however, we also find new plausible
member stars, two of which are located >5 half-light radii from the main body.

"Title:The gas kinematics, excitation, and chemistry, in connection with star formation, in lenticular galaxies","
Abstract:  We present results of long-slit and panoramic spectroscopy of extended
gaseous disks in 18 nearby S0 galaxies, mostly in groups. The gas in our S0s is
found to be often accreted from outside that is implied by its decoupled
kinematics: at least 5 galaxies demonstrate strongly inclined large-scale
ionized-gas disks smoothly coupled with their outer HI disks, 7 galaxies reveal
circumnuclear polar ionized-gas disks, and in NGC 2551 the ionized gas though
confined to the main galactic plane however counterrotates the stellar
component. The ionized-gas excitation analysis reveals the gas ionization by
young stars in 12 of 18 S0 galaxies studied here; the current star formation in
these galaxies is confined to the ring-like zones coinciding with the UV-rings.
The gas oxygen abundance estimates in the rings are closely concentrated around
the value of 0.7 $Z_\odot$ and do not correlate either with the ring radius nor
with the metallicity of the underlying stellar population. By applying the
tilted-ring analysis to the 2D velocity fields of the ionized gas, we have
traced the orientation of the gas rotation-plane lines of nodes along the
radius. We have found that current star formation proceeds usually just where
the gas lies strictly in the stellar disk planes and rotates there circularly;
the sense of the gas rotation does not matter (the counterrotating gas in NGC
2551 form stars currently). In the galaxies without signs of current star
formation the extended gaseous disks are either in steady-state quasi-polar
orientation (NGC 2655, NGC 2787, NGC 3414, UGC 9519), or are acquired recently
through the highly inclined external filaments provoking probably shock-like
excitation (NGC 4026, NGC 7280). Our data imply crucial difference of the
external-gas accretion regime in S0s with respect to spiral galaxies: the
geometry of the gas accretion in S0s is typically off-plane.

Title:High-resolution transmission spectroscopy of four hot inflated gas giant exoplanets,"
Abstract:  The technique of transmission spectroscopy allows us to constrain the
chemical composition of the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. It relies on
very high signal-to-noise spectroscopic (or spectrophotometric) observations
and is thus most suited for bright exoplanet host stars. In the era of TESS,
NGST and PLATO, more and more suitable targets, even for mid-sized telescopes,
are discovered. Furthermore, a wealth of archival data is available that could
become a basis for long-term monitoring of exo-atmospheres. We analyzed
archival HARPS spectroscopic time series of four host stars to transiting
bloated gas exoplanets, namely WASP-76b, WASP-127b, WASP-166b and KELT-11b,
searching for traces of sodium (sodium doublet), hydrogen (H$\alpha$,
H$\beta$), and lithium (670.8 nm). The archival data sets include spectroscopic
time series taken during transits. Comparing in- and out-of-transit spectra we
can filter out the stellar lines and investigate the absorption from the
planet. Simultaneously, the stellar activity is monitored using the Mg I and Ca
I lines. We independently detect sodium in the atmosphere of WASP-76b at a 7-9
$\sigma$ level. Furthermore, we report also at 4-8 $\sigma$ level of
significance the detection of sodium in the atmosphere of WASP-127b, confirming
earlier result based on low-resolution spectroscopy. The data show no sodium
nor any other atom at high confidence levels for WASP-166b nor KELT-11b,
hinting at the presence of thick high clouds.

Title:Characterization of Ring Substructures in the Protoplanetary Disk of HD 169142 from Multi-Wavelength ALMA Observations,"
Abstract:  We present a detailed multi-wavelength characterization of the multi-ring
disk of HD 169142. We report new ALMA observations at 3 mm and analyze them
together with archival 0.89 and 1.3 mm data. Our observations resolve three out
of the four rings in the disk previously seen in high-resolution ALMA data. A
simple parametric model is used to estimate the radial profile of the dust
optical depth, temperature, density, and particle size distribution. We find
that the multiple ring features of the disk are produced by annular
accumulations of large particles, probably associated with gas pressure bumps.
Our model indicates that the maximum dust grain size in the rings is $\sim1$
cm, with slightly flatter power-law size distributions than the ISM-like size
distribution ($p\sim3.5$) found in the gaps. In particular, the inner ring
($\sim26$ au) is associated with a strong and narrow buildup of dust particles
that could harbor the necessary conditions to trigger the streaming
instability. According to our analysis, the snowlines of the most important
volatiles do not coincide with the observed substructures. We explore different
ring formation mechanisms and find that planet-disk interactions are the most
likely scenario to explain the main features of HD 169142. Overall, our
multi-wavelength analysis provides some of the first unambiguous evidence of
the presence of radial dust traps in the rings of HD 169142. A similar analysis
in a larger sample of disks could provide key insights on the impact that disk
substructures have on the dust evolution and planet formation processes.

Title:The Birth of a Jet-driven Twin CME and Its Deflection from Remote Magnetic Fields,"
Abstract:  We report the formation of a complicated coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2015
August 23 by using the high temporal and high spatial resolution
multi-wavelength observations taken by the Solar Dynamic Observatory and the
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. The CME exhibited both jet-like and
bubble-like components simultaneously, and therefore we call it a twin CME.
Detailed imaging and kinematic analysis results indicate that the twin CME were
evolved form the eruption of a mini-filament driven blowout jet at the east
edge of an equatorial coronal hole, in which the activation of the
mini-filament was tightly associated with the continuous flux cancellation and
quasi-periodic jet-like activities in the filament channel. Due to the magnetic
reconnection between the filament and the ambient open field lines, the
filament broke partially at the northern part and resulted in an intriguing
blowout jet in the south direction. It is interesting that the ejecting jet was
deflected by a group of remote open field lines, which resulted in the
significant direction change of the jet from southward to eastward. Based on
the close temporal and spatial relationships among the jet, filament eruption,
and the twin CME, we conclude that the jet-like CME should be the coronal
extension of the jet plasma, while the bubble-like one should be originated
from the eruption of the mini-filament confined by the closed magnetic fields
at the jet-base.

Title:A diagnostic on the orbital spectrum of LS 5039 with Fermi-LAT,"
Abstract:  LS 5039 is a well-known $\gamma$-ray binary system which consists of an
unknown compact object and a massive companion O star. It shows rather stable
emissions at high energies over years and hence serves as an ideal laboratory
to investigate the emission mechanism for such peculiar systems which emit
prominent $\gamma$-rays. To this end, we take the orbital phase resolved energy
spectrum as observed by \fermi over 10 years. We divide the orbit into four
orbital phases, each with an orbital phase range of 0.25, centered at 0.00,
0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 respectively, where the phase 0.0 is the periastron and
phase 0.5 is the apastron. The phases around 0.25 and 0.75 are symmetric and
hence are supposed to have identical local acceleration environment. The
spectral analysis shows that, the \fermi spectra are largely different from
these two symmetric orbital phases: the emission from orbital phase 0.25 turns
out to be significantly stronger than that from 0.75. This result does not fit
a scenario that $\gamma$-rays are Doppler boosted emission from bow shock tails
if LS 5039 has a shock configuration similar to PSR B1259-63, and indicates
that the inverse Compton scatterings between the shock accelerated plasma and
the stellar particle environment is the underline procedure. We also find that
the previous report for a disappearance of the orbital modulation at 3--20 GeV
is due to the similar spectral turn-over energies of the different orbital
phases. The spectral properties of periastron and apastron regions are
addressed in the context of the measurements in phase regions around 0.25 and
0.75.

Title:The Gaia-ESO survey: Calibrating a relationship between Age and the [C/N] abundance ratio with open clusters,"
Abstract:  In the era of large high-resolution spectroscopic surveys, high-quality
spectra can contribute to our understanding of the Galactic chemical evolution,
providing chemical abundances belonging to the different nucleosynthesis
channels, and also providing constraints to stellar age. Some abundance ratios
have been proven to be excellent indicators of stellar ages. We aim at
providing an empirical relationship between stellar ages and [C/N] using, as
calibrators, open star clusters observed by both the Gaia-ESO and APOGEE
surveys. We use stellar parameters and abundances from the Gaia-ESO and APOGEE
of the Galactic field and open cluster stars. Ages of star clusters are
retrieved from the literature sources and validated using a common set of
isochrones. We use the same isochrones to determine, for each age and
metallicity, the surface gravity at which the first dredge-up and red giant
branch bump occur. We study the effect of extra-mixing processes in our sample
of giant stars, and we derive the mean [C/N] in evolved stars, including only
stars without evidence of extra-mixing. Combining the Gaia-ESO and APOGEE
samples of open clusters, we derive a linear relationship between [C/N] and
logarithmic cluster ages. We apply our relationship to selected giant field
stars in both Gaia-ESO and APOGEE. We find an age separation between thin and
thick disc stars and age trends within their populations, with an increasing
age towards lower metallicity populations. With such empirical relationship, we
are able to provide an age estimate for giant stars in which C and N abundances
are measured. Isochrone fitting is less sensitive for giant than dwarf stars at
the turn off. The present method can be thus considered as an additional tool
to give an independent estimate of the age of giant stars, with uncertainties
in their ages comparable to those obtained using isochrone fitting for dwarf
stars.

Title:An ALMA view of the Galactic super star cluster RCW38 at 270-AU resolution,"
Abstract:  We report millimeter/submillimeter continuum and molecular line observations
of the Galactic super star cluster RCW 38, obtained from the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array with a minimum angular resolution of
$0''.17\times0''.15$ ($\simeq289\,{\rm AU}\times255\,{\rm AU}$). The C$^{18}$O
image reveal many massive condensations embedded within filamentary structures
extending along the northwest-southeast direction in the center of cluster. The
condensations have sizes of 0.01-0.02 pc, H$_2$ column densities of
$10^{23}$-$10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and H$_2$ masses of 10-130 $M_\odot$. In
addition, the 233-GHz continuum image reveals two dense, small
millimeter-sources with radii of 460 and 200 AU (Source A and Source B). Source
A is embedded within the most massive C$^{18}$O condensation, whereas no
counterpart is seen for Source B. The masses of Source A and Source B are
estimated as 13 and 3 $M_\odot$ at the optically-thin limit, respectively. The
C$^{18}$O emission shows a velocity gradient of 2 km s$^{-1}$ at the central
2000 AU of Source A, which could be interpreted as a Keplerian rotation with a
central mass of a few $M_\odot$ or infall motion of gas. Further, the ALMA
$^{12}$CO data reveal that Source A and Source B are associated with molecular
outflows exhibiting maximum velocities of $\sim$30-70 km s$^{-1}$. The outflows
have short dynamical timescales of $<$1000 yr and high mass outflow rates of
$\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. These observational signatures
suggest an early evolutionary phase of the massive star formation in Source A
and Source B.

Title:A Multidimensional Dependence of the Substructure Evolution on the Tidal Coherence,"
Abstract:  We numerically explore how the subhalo mass-loss evolution is affected by the
tidal coherences measured along different eigenvector directions. The mean
virial-to-accretion mass ratios of the subhalos are used to quantify the
severity of their mass-loss evolutions within the hosts, and the tidal
coherence is expressed as an array of three numbers each of which quantifies
the alignment between the tidal fields smoothed on the scales of $2$ and
$30\,h^{-1}$Mpc in each direction of three principal axes. Using a Rockstar
halo catalog retrieved from a N-body simulation, we investigate if and how the
mass-loss evolutions of the subhalos hosted by distinct halos at fixed mass
scale of [$1$-$3$]$10^{14}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ are correlated with three
components of the tidal coherence. The tides coherent along different
eigenvector directions are found to have different effects on the subhalo
mass-loss evolution, which cannot be ascribed to the differences in the
densities and ellipticities of the local environments. It is shown that the
substructures surrounded by the tides highly coherent along the first
eigenvector direction and highly {\it incoherent} along the third eigenvector
direction experience the least severe mass-loss evolution, while the tides
highly {\it incoherent} only along the first eigenvector direction is
responsible for the most severe mass-loss evolution of the subhalos. Explaining
that the coherent tides have an obstructing effect on the satellite infalls
onto their hosts and that the strength of the obstruction effect depends on
which directions the tides are coherent or {\it incoherent} along, we suggest
that the multidimensional dependence of the substructure evolution on the tidal
coherence should be deeply related to the complex nature of the large-scale
assembly bias.

Title:A three-dimensional map of the hot Local Bubble using diffuse interstellar bands,"
Abstract:  The Solar System is located within a low-density cavity, known as the Local
Bubble, which appears to be filled with an X-ray emitting gas at a temperature
of 10$^6$ K. Such conditions are too harsh for typical interstellar atoms and
molecules to survive. There exists an enigmatic tracer of interstellar gas,
known as Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIB), which often appears as absorption
features in stellar spectra. The carriers of these bands remain largely
unidentified. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the Local
Bubble using two different DIB tracers ($\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$5797), which
reveals that DIB carriers are present within the Bubble. The map shows low
ratios of $\lambda$5797/$\lambda$5780 inside the Bubble compared to the
outside. This finding proves that the carrier of the $\lambda$5780 DIB can
withstand X-ray photo-dissociation and sputtering by fast ions, where the
carrier of the $\lambda$5797 DIB succumbs. This would mean that DIB carriers
can be more stable than hitherto thought and that the carrier of the
$\lambda$5780 DIB must be larger than that of the $\lambda$5797 DIB.
Alternatively, small-scale denser (and cooler) structures that shield some of
the DIB carriers must be prevalent within the Bubble, implying that such
structures may be an intrinsic feature of supernova-driven bubbles.

Title:Role of planetary obliquity in regulating atmospheric escape: G-dwarf vs. M-dwarf Earth-like exoplanets,"
Abstract:  We present a three-species (H$^+$, O$^+$ and e$^-$) multi-fluid
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, endowed with the requisite upper atmospheric
chemistry, that is capable of accurately quantifying the magnitude of oxygen
ion losses from ""Earth-like"" exoplanets in habitable zones, whose magnetic and
rotational axes are roughly coincidental with one another. We apply this model
to investigate the role of planetary obliquity in regulating atmospheric losses
from a magnetic perspective. For Earth-like exoplanets orbiting solar-type
stars, we demonstrate that the dependence of the total atmospheric ion loss
rate on the planetary (magnetic) obliquity is relatively weak; the escape rates
are found to vary between $2.19 \times 10^{26}$ s$^{-1}$ to $2.37 \times
10^{26}$ s$^{-1}$. In contrast, the obliquity can influence the atmospheric
escape rate ($\sim$ $10^{28}$ s$^{-1}$) by more than a factor of $2$ (or
$200\%$) in the case of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting late-type M-dwarfs.
Thus, our simulations indicate that planetary obliquity may play a
weak-to-moderate role insofar as the retention of an atmosphere (necessary for
surface habitability) is concerned.

present first results of the performance assessment for the solar wind modeling
with EUHFORIA and identify possible limitations of its present setup. Using the
basic EUHFORIA 1.0.4. model setup with the default input parameters, we modeled
background solar wind (no coronal mass ejections) and compared the obtained
results with ACE, in situ measurements. For the need of statistical study we
developed a technique of combining daily EUHFORIA runs into continuous time
series. The combined time series were derived for the years 2008 (low solar
activity) and 2012 (high solar activity) from which in situ speed and density
profiles were extracted. We find for the low activity phase a better match
between model results and observations compared to the considered high activity
time interval. The quality of the modeled solar wind parameters is found to be
rather variable. Therefore, to better understand the obtained results we also
qualitatively inspected characteristics of coronal holes, sources of the
studied fast streams. We discuss how different characteristics of the coronal
holes and input parameters to EUHFORIA influence the modeled fast solar wind,
and suggest possibilities for the improvements of the model.

Title:Synchrotron self absorption and the minimum energy of optically thick radio flares from stellar mass black holes,"
Abstract:  We consider the case of radio flares from black hole X-ray binaries in which
the flare spectrum evolves from optically thick to optically thin, under the
assumption that this is due to decreasing optical depth to synchrotron self
absorption. We are able to place upper and lower limits on the size of the
emitting region associated with a radio flare, and determine the synchrotron
source magnetic field and energy as a function of size. The energy has a clear
minimum which occurs close to the condition that the magnetic field derived
from synchrotron self absorption equals that calculated from equipartition.
This minimum energy estimate is independent of the rise time of the event, and
so may be applied to any event for which the peak flux is measured and there is
evidence for self-absorption. This is a much more accurate approach to minimum
energy estimation than assuming expansion at close to the speed of light. We
apply this method to four examples of optically thick radio flares and find
that in each case either the filling factor of the synchrotron source is
considerably less than unity, or the expansion speed is considerably less than
the speed of light. The combination of unity filling factor and expansion
speeds close to the speed of light is completely ruled out on energetic grounds
for three of the four events we consider. The inferred slowed expansion is
consistent with detailed modelling of such events which has been recently
reported in the literature. The minimum power requirements associated with the
flares are found to be ~ 1e36 erg/s, which are easily accomodated in the
context of stellar mass black hole accretion at near-Eddington levels, when
these flares typically occur. However, the true jet power could still be orders
of magnitude higher.

Title:Incorporating Astrochemistry into Molecular Line Modelling via Emulation,"
Abstract:  In studies of the interstellar medium in galaxies, radiative transfer models
of molecular emission are useful for relating molecular line observations back
to the physical conditions of the gas they trace. However, doing this requires
solving a highly degenerate inverse problem. In order to alleviate these
degeneracies, the abundances derived from astrochemical models can be converted
into column densities and fed into radiative transfer models. This enforces
that the molecular gas composition used by the radiative transfer models be
chemically realistic. However, because of the complexity and long running time
of astrochemical models, it can be difficult to incorporate chemical models
into the radiative transfer framework. In this paper, we introduce a
statistical emulator of the UCLCHEM astrochemical model, built using neural
networks. We then illustrate, through examples of parameter estimations, how
such an emulator can be applied on real and synthetic observations.

Title:Real-time cosmology with SKA,"
Abstract:  In this work, we investigate what role the redshift drift data of Square
Kilometre Array (SKA) will play in the cosmological parameter estimation in the
future. To test the constraint capability of the redshift drift data of
SKA-only, the $\Lambda$CDM model is chosen as a reference model. We find that
using the SKA1 mock data, the $\Lambda$CDM model can be loosely constrained,
while the model can be well constrained when the SKA2 mock data are used. When
the mock data of SKA are combined with the data of the European Extremely Large
Telescope (E-ELT), the constraints can be significantly improved almost as good
as the data combination of the type Ia supernovae observation (SN), the cosmic
microwave background observation (CMB), and the baryon acoustic oscillations
observation (BAO). Furthermore, we explore the impact of the redshift drift
data of SKA on the basis of SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT in the $\Lambda$CDM model, the
$w$CDM model, the CPL model, and the HDE model. We find that the redshift drift
measurement of SKA could help to significantly improve the constraints on dark
energy and could break the degeneracy between the cosmological parameters.
Therefore, we conclude that redshift-drift observation of SKA would provide a
good improvement in the cosmological parameter estimation in the future and has
the enormous potential to be one of the most competitive cosmological probes in
constraining dark energy.

2$\sigma$. Concerning the current value of the dark energy equation of state
for all combination of datasets it always lies in the phantom regime at more
than two/three standard deviations. Finally, for all interacting models,
independently of the combination of datasets considered, the estimated values
of the present Hubble parameter $H_0$ are greater compared to the

thus alleviating the $H_0$ tension.

Title:Impact of an off-centred dipole on neutron star binaries,"
Abstract:  Neutron stars are strongly magnetized rotating compact objects. Therefore
they also produce huge electric fields accelerating particles to
ultra-relativistic energies. The simplest magnetic topology is a dipole
traditionally located at the stellar centre. In this paper, we reinvestigate
the consequences of an off-centred rotating magnetic dipole, showing accurate
magnetic field line geometries, the associated spin-down luminosity as well as
the corresponding electromagnetic kick and torque imprinted to the neutron
star. Results are obtained by time dependent numerical simulations of Maxwell
equations in vacuum using pseudo-spectral methods. We compare our results to
known analytical expressions available to lowest order in the parameter
$\epsilon = d/R$, where $d$ is the displacement of the dipole from the stellar
centre and $R$ the neutron star radius. We found good agreement between our

Title:All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory: Exploring the Extreme Multimessenger Universe,"
Abstract:  The All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO) is a probe class
mission concept that will provide essential contributions to multimessenger
astrophysics in the late 2020s and beyond. AMEGO combines high sensitivity in
the 200 keV to 10 GeV energy range with a wide field of view, good spectral
resolution, and polarization sensitivity. Therefore, AMEGO is key in the study
of multimessenger astrophysical objects that have unique signatures in the
gamma-ray regime, such as neutron star mergers, supernovae, and flaring active
galactic nuclei. The order-of-magnitude improvement compared to previous MeV
missions also enables discoveries of a wide range of phenomena whose energy
output peaks in the relatively unexplored medium-energy gamma-ray band.

Title:Detailed spectroscopic and photometric study of three detached eclipsing binaries,"
Abstract:  Detached eclipsing binaries are remarkable systems to provide accurate
fundamental stellar parameters. The fundamental stellar parameters and the
metallicity values of stellar systems are needed to deeply understand the
stellar evolution and formation. In this study, we focus on the detailed
spectroscopic and photometric studies of three detached eclipsing binary
systems, V372\,And, V2080\,Cyg, and CF\,Lyn to obtain their accurate stellar,
atmospheric parameters,and chemical compositions. An analysis of light and
radial velocity curves was carried out to derive the orbital and stellar
parameters. The disentangled spectra of component stars were obtained for the
spectroscopic analysis. Final \teff, \logg, $\xi$, \vsini\, parameters and the
element abundances of component stars were derived by using the spectrum
synthesis method. The fundamental stellar parameters were determined with a
high certainty for V372\,And, V2080\,Cyg ($\sim$$1-2$\%) and with an accuracy
for CF\,Lyn ($\sim$$2-6$\%). The evolutionary status of the systems was
examined and their ages were obtained. It was found that the component stars of
V2080\,Cyg have similar iron abundance which is slightly lower than solar iron
abundance. Additionally, we showed that the primary component of CF\,Lyn
exhibits a non-spherical shape with its 80\% Roche lobe filling factor. It
could be estimated that CF\,Lyn will start its first Roche overflow in the next
0.02\,Gyr.

Title:The Transient program of the Cherenkov Telescope Array,"
Abstract:  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the next generation high-energy
gamma-ray observatory. It will improve the sensitivity of current instruments
up to an order of magnitude, while providing energy coverage for photons from
20 GeV to at least 300 TeV to reach high redshifts and extreme accelerators and
will give access to the shortest time-scale phenomena. CTA is thus a uniquely
powerful instrument for the exploration of the violent and variable universe.
The ability to probe short timescales at the highest energies will allow CTA to
explore the connection between accretion and ejection phenomena surrounding
compact objects, investigate the processes occurring in relativistic outflows,
and open up significant phase space for serendipitous discoveries. Aiming at
playing a central role in the era of multi-messenger astrophysics, the CTA
Transient program includes follow-up observations of a broad range of
multi-wavelength and multi-messenger alerts, ranging from Galactic compact
object binary systems to novel phenomena like Fast Radio Bursts. A promising
case is that of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), where CTA will for the first time
enable high-statistics measurements above $\sim$ 10 GeV, probing new spectral
components and shedding light on the physical processes at work in these
systems. Dedicated programs searching for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray
counterparts to gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos complete the CTA
transients program. This contribution will introduce and outline the CTA
Transients program. We will provide an overview of the various science topics
and discuss the links to multi-messenger and multi-wavelength observations.

Title:New physics in light of the $H_0$ tension: an alternative view,"
Abstract:  The strong discrepancy between local and inverse distance ladder estimates of
the Hubble constant $H_0$ could be pointing towards new physics beyond
$\Lambda$CDM. Several attempts to address this tension through new physics rely
on extended models, featuring extra free parameters beyond the 6 $\Lambda$CDM
parameters. However, marginalizing over extra parameters has the effect of
broadening the uncertainties on the inferred parameters, and it is often the
case that within these models the $H_0$ tension is addressed due to larger
uncertainties rather than a genuine shift in the central value of $H_0$. What
happens if a physical theory is able to fix the extra parameters to a specific
set of non-standard values? The degrees of freedom of the model are reduced
with respect to the standard case where the extra parameters are free to vary.
Focusing on the dark energy equation of state $w$ and the effective number of
relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, I find that physical theories able to fix
$w \approx -1.3$ or $N_{\rm eff} \approx 3.95$ would lead to an estimate of
$H_0$ from CMB, BAO, and SNeIa data in perfect agreement with the local
distance ladder estimate, without broadening its uncertainty. These two
non-standard models are, from a model-selection perspective, strongly
disfavoured with respect to $\Lambda$CDM. However, models that predict $N_{\rm
eff} \approx 3.45$ would be able to bring the tension down to $1.5\sigma$ while
only being weakly disfavored with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, whereas models that
predict $w \approx -1.1$ would be able to bring the tension down to $2\sigma$
(at the cost of the preference for $\Lambda$CDM being definite). Finally, I
estimate dimensionless multipliers relating variations in $H_0$ to variations
in $w$ and $N_{\rm eff}$, which can be used to repeat the analysis of this
paper in light of future more precise local distance ladder estimates of $H_0$.

Title:Assessment of the probability of microbial contamination for sample return from Martian moons I: Departure of microbes from Martian surface,"
Abstract:  Potential microbial contamination of Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, which
can be brought about by transportation of Mars ejecta produced by meteoroid
impacts on the Martian surface, has been comprehensively assessed in a
statistical approach, based on the most probable history of recent major
gigantic meteoroid collisions on the Martian surface. This article is the first
part of our study to assess potential microbial density in Mars ejecta
departing from the Martian atmosphere, as a source of the second part where
statistical analysis of microbial contamination probability is conducted.
Potential microbial density on the Martian surface as the source of
microorganisms was estimated by analogy to the terrestrial areas having the
similar arid and cold environments, from which a probabilistic function was
deduced as the asymptotic limit. Microbial survival rate during hypervelocity
meteoroid collisions was estimated by numerical analysis of impact phenomena
with and without taking internal friction and plastic deformation of the
colliding meteoroid and the target ground into consideration. Trajectory
calculations of departing ejecta through the Martian atmosphere were conducted
with taking account of aerodynamic deceleration and heating by the aid of
computational fluid dynamic analysis. It is found that Mars ejecta smaller than
0.03 m in diameter hardly reach the Phobos orbit due to aerodynamic
deceleration, or mostly sterilized due to significant aerodynamic heating even
though they can reach the Phobos orbit and beyond. Finally, the baseline
dataset of microbial density in Mars ejecta departing for Martian moons has
been presented for the second part of our study.

Title:Assessment of the probability of microbial contamination for sample return from Martian moons II: The fate of microbes on Martian moons,"
Abstract:  This paper presents a case study of microbe transportation in the
Mars-satellites system. We examined the spatial distribution of potential
impact-transported microbes on the Martian moons using impact physics by
following a companion study (Fujita et al.). We used sterilization data from
the precede studies. We considered that the microbes came mainly from the Zunil
crater on Mars. We found that 70-80% of the microbes are likely to be dispersed
all over the moon surface and are rapidly sterilized due to radiation except
for those microbes within a thick ejecta deposit produced by meteoroids. The
other 20-30% might be shielded from radiation by thick regolith layers that
formed at collapsed layers in craters produced by Mars rock impacts. The total
number of potentially surviving microbes at the thick ejecta deposits is
estimated to be 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than at the Mars rock craters.
The microbe concentration is irregular in the horizontal direction and is
largely depth-dependent due to the radiation sterilization. The surviving
fraction of transported microbes would be only 1 ppm on Phobos and 100 ppm on
Deimos, suggesting that the transport processes and radiation severely affect
microbe survival. The microbe sampling probability from the Martian moons was
also investigated. We suggest that sample return missions from the Martian
moons are classified into Unrestricted Earth-Return missions for 30 g samples
and 10 cm depth sampling, even in our conservative scenario. We also conducted
a full statistical analysis for sampling the regolith of Phobos to include the
effects of uncertainties in input parameters on the sampling probability. The
most likely probability of microbial contamination for return samples is
estimated to be two orders of magnitude lower than the criterion defined by the
planetary protection policy of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR).

Title:Constraining the initial planetary population in the gravitational instability model,"
Abstract:  Direct imaging (DI) surveys suggest that gas giants beyond 20 AU are rare
around FGK stars. However, it is not clear what this means for the formation
frequency of Gravitational Instability (GI) protoplanets due to uncertainties
in gap opening and migration efficiency. Here we combine state-of-the-art
calculations of homogeneous planet contraction with a population synthesis
code. We find DI constraints to be satisfied if protoplanet formation by GI
occurs in tens of percent of systems if protoplanets `super migrate' to small
separations. In contrast, GI may occur in only a few percent of systems if
protoplanets remain stranded at wide orbits because their migration is
`quenched' by efficient gap opening. We then use the frequency of massive
giants in radial velocity surveys inside 5 AU to break this degeneracy -
observations recently showed that this population does not correlate with the
host star metallicity and is therefore suspected to have formed via GI followed
by inward migration. We find that only the super-migration scenario can
sufficiently explain this population whilst simultaneously satisfying the DI
constraints and producing the right mass spectrum of planets inside 5 AU. If
massive gas-giants inside 5 AU formed via GI, then our models imply that
migration must be efficient and that the formation of GI protoplanets occurs in
at least a tens of percent of systems.

"Title:Gamma-ray burst jet propagation, development of angular structure, and the luminosity function","
Abstract:  The fate and observable properties of gamma-ray burst jets depend crucially
on their interaction with the progenitor material that surrounds the central
engine. We present a semi-analytical model of such interaction, which builds
upon several previous analytical and numerical works, aimed at predicting the
angular distribution of jet and cocoon energy and Lorentz factor after
breakout, given the properties of the ambient material and of the jet at
launch. Using this model, we construct synthetic populations of structured
jets, assuming either a collapsar (for long gamma-ray bursts -- LGRBs) or a
binary neutron star merger (for short gamma-ray bursts -- SGRBs) as progenitor.
We assume all progenitors to be identical, and we allow little variability in
the jet properties at launch: our populations therefore feature a
quasi-universal structure. These populations are able to reproduce the main
features of the observed LGRB and SGRB luminosity functions, although several
uncertainties and caveats remain to be addressed.

Title:Dense cores and star formation in the giant molecular cloud Vela~C,"
Abstract:  Context The Vela Molecular Ridge is one of the nearest (700 pc) giant
molecular cloud (GMC) complexes hosting intermediate-mass (up to early B, late
O stars) star formation, and is located in the outer Galaxy, inside the
Galactic plane. Vela C is one of the GMCs making up the Vela Molecular Ridge,
and exhibits both sub-regions of robust and sub-regions of more quiescent star
formation activity, with both low- and intermediate(high)-mass star formation
in progress. Aims We aim to study the individual and global properties of dense
dust cores in Vela C, and aim to search for spatial variations in these
properties which could be related to different environmental properties and/or
evolutionary stages in the various sub-regions of Vela C. Methods We mapped the
submillimetre (345 GHz) emission from vela C with LABOCA (beam size 19.2"",
spatial resolution ~0.07 pc at 700 pc) at the APEX telescope. We used the
clump-finding algorithm CuTEx to identify the compact submillimetre sources. We
also used SIMBA (250 GHz) observations, and Herschel and WISE ancillary data.
The association with WISE red sources allowed the protostellar and starless
cores to be separated, whereas the Herschel dataset allowed the dust
temperature to be derived for a fraction of cores. The protostellar and
starless core mass functions (CMFs) were constructed following two different
approaches, achieving a mass completeness limit of 3.7 Msun. Results We
retrieved 549 submillimetre cores, 316 of which are starless and mostly
gravitationally bound (therefore prestellar in nature). Both the protostellar
and the starless CMFs are consistent with the shape of a Salpeter initial mass
function in the high-mass part of the distribution. Clustering of cores at
scales of 1--6 pc is also found, hinting at fractionation of magnetised,
turbulent gas.

Title:Dynamically generated inflationary two-field potential via non-Riemannian volume forms,"
Abstract:  We consider a simple model of modified gravity interacting with a single
scalar field $\varphi$ with weakly coupled exponential potential within the
framework of non-Riemannian spacetime volume-form formalism. The specific form
of the action is fixed by the requirement of invariance under global Weyl-scale
symmetry. Upon passing to the physical Einstein frame we show how the
non-Riemannian volume elements create a second canonical scalar field $u$ and
dynamically generate a non-trivial two-scalar-field potential $U_{\rm
eff}(u,\varphi)$ with two remarkable features: (i) it possesses a large flat
region for large $u$ describing a slow-roll inflation; (ii) it has a stable
low-lying minimum w.r.t. $(u,\varphi)$ representing the dark energy density in
the ""late universe"". We study the corresponding two-field slow-roll inflation
and show that the pertinent slow-roll inflationary curve $\varphi = \varphi(u)$
in the two-field space $(u,\varphi)$ has a very small curvature, i.e.,
$\varphi$ changes very little during the inflationary evolution of $u$ on the
flat region of $U_{\rm eff}(u,\varphi)$. Explicit expressions are found for the
slow-roll parameters which differ from those in the single-field inflationary
counterpart. Numerical solutions for the scalar spectral index and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio are derived agreeing with the observational data.

Title:Accelerating the search for Axion-Like Particles with machine learning,"
Abstract:  Machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied with tremendous success in
many areas of physics. In this work, we use ML to place bounds on the coupling
between photons and axion-like particles (ALPs). This coupling causes ALPs and
photons to interconvert in the presence of a background magnetic field. This
would lead to modulations in the spectra of point sources shining through the
magnetic fields of galaxy clusters. This effect has already been used to place
world-leading bounds on the ALP-photon coupling using conventional statistical
methods. We train ML classification algorithms on simulated spectra from the
Chandra X-ray telescope for a range of point sources and ALP-photon couplings.
We then use the response of these algorithms to the real Chandra spectra to
place bounds on ALP-photon interactions. We obtain bounds at a similar level to
those based on other techniques, but find improvements on an individual source
basis. We expect such search techniques to become increasingly important for
ALP searches with future telescopes that will offer substantially higher energy
resolution.

"Title:Self-lensing Discovery of a $0.2\,M_\odot$ White Dwarf in an Unusually Wide Orbit Around a Sun-like Star","
Abstract:  We report the discovery of the fifth self-lensing binary in which a low-mass
white dwarf (WD) gravitationally magnifies its 15th magnitude G-star companion,
KIC 8145411, during eclipses. The system was identified from a pair of such
self-lensing events in the Kepler photometry, and was followed up with the
Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES) on the 1.5m telescope at the
Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory and the High-Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) on
the Subaru 8.2m telescope. A joint analysis of the TRES radial velocities, the
HDS spectrum, and the Kepler photometry of the primary star determines the WD
mass $0.20\pm0.01\,M_\odot$, orbital semi-major axis
$1.28\pm0.03\,\mathrm{au}$, and orbital eccentricity $0.14\pm0.02$. Because
such extremely low-mass WDs cannot be formed in isolation within the age of the
Galaxy, their formation is believed to involve binary interactions that
truncated evolution of the WD progenitor. However, the observed orbit of the
KIC 8145411 system is at least ten times wider than required for this scenario
to work. The presence of this system in the Kepler sample, along with its
similarities to field blue straggler binaries presumably containing WDs, may
suggest that some 10% of post-AGB binaries with Sun-like primaries contain such
anomalous WDs.

Abstract:  We examine the diagnostic power of rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) nebular
emission lines, and compare them to more commonly used rest-frame optical
emission lines, using the test case of a single star-forming knot of the bright
lensed galaxy RCSGA 032727-132609 at redshift z~1.7. This galaxy has complete
coverage of all the major rest-frame UV and optical emission lines from
Magellan/MagE and Keck/NIRSPEC. Using the full suite of diagnostic lines, we
infer the physical properties: nebular electron temperature (T_e), electron
density (n_e), oxygen abundance (log(O/H)), ionisation parameter (log(q)) and
interstellar medium (ISM) pressure (log(P/k)). We examine the effectiveness of
the different UV, optical and joint UV-optical spectra in constraining the
physical conditions. Using UV lines alone we can reliably estimate log(q), but
the same is difficult for log(O/H). UV lines yield a higher (~1.5 dex) log(P/k)
than the optical lines, as the former probes a further inner nebular region
than the latter. For this comparison, we extend the existing Bayesian inference
code IZI, adding to it the capability to infer ISM pressure simultaneously with
metallicity and ionisation parameter. This work anticipates future rest-frame
UV spectral datasets from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at high
redshift and from the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) at moderate redshift.

Title:Helium and Nitrogen Enrichment in Massive Main Sequence Stars: Mechanisms and Implications for the Origin of WNL Stars,"
Abstract:  The evolutionary paths taken by massive stars with $M \gtrsim 60 \,
\mathrm{M}_\odot$ remain substantially uncertain. They begin their lives as
main sequence (MS) O-stars. Depending on their masses, rotation rates, and
metallicities, they can then encounter a wide range of evolutionary states with
an equally broad set of possible surface compositions and spectral
classifications. We present a new grid of calculations for the evolution of
such stars that covers a broad range in mass, M/M$_\odot = 60$ to $150$,
rotation rate, $v \, / \, v_{\rm crit} = 0$ to $0.6$, metallicity,
$[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] = -4$ to $0$, and $\alpha$-element enhancement,
$[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}] = 0$ to $0.4$. We show that rotating stars undergo
rotationally-induced dredge-up of nucleosynthetic products, mostly He and N, to
their surfaces while still on the MS. Non-rotating metal-rich stars also reveal
the products of nucleosynthesis on their surfaces because even modest amounts
of mass loss expose their ""fossil"" convective cores: regions that are no longer
convective, but which were part of the convective core at an early stage in the
star's evolution. Thus surface enhancement of He and N is expected for rotating
stars at all metallicities, and for non-rotating stars if they are relatively
metal-rich. We calculate a stellar atmosphere for a representative model from
our grid, properly accounting for He- and N-enhancement, and show that the
resulting spectrum provides a good match to observed WNL stars, strongly
suggesting that the physical mechanisms we have identified are the ultimate
cause of the WNL phase.

Title:Generalized Brans-Dicke theories in light of evolving dark energy,"
Abstract:  The expansion history of the Universe reconstructed from a combination of
recent data indicates a preference for a changing Dark Energy (DE) density.
Moreover, the DE density appears to be increasing with cosmic time, with its
equation of state being below -1 on average, and possibly crossing the
so-called phantom divide. Scalar-tensor theories, in which the scalar field
mediates a force between matter particles, offer a natural framework in which
the effective DE equation of state can be less than -1 and cross the phantom
barrier. We consider the generalized Brans-Dicke (GBD) class of scalar-tensor
theories and reconstruct their Lagrangian given the effective DE density
extracted from recent data. Then, given the reconstructed Lagrangian, we solve
for the linear perturbations and investigate the characteristic signatures of
these reconstructed GBD in the cosmological observables, such as the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, the galaxy number counts, and their
cross-correlations. In particular, we demonstrate that the Integrated
Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect probed by the cross-correlation of CMB with the matter
distribution can rule out scalar-tensor theories as the explanation of the
observed DE dynamics independently from the laboratory and solar system fifth
force constraints.

50-cm collecting apertures, separated by a 6-meter baseline.
The heart of this detector is the Astrometric Beam Combiner (ABC). This is
flight-quality hardware that underwent testing at high levels of integration,
retiring most technical risk (achieving TRL-6) after 10 years and $600 million
of investment. The ABC is in storage at JPL, ready to complete testing,
followed by integration with the mission support structure.
Star Watch incorporates advances in technology since the end of the SIM
project. These include smaller, lighter beam launchers and corner cubes for
laser metrology; attitude-control micro-thrusters, allowing deletion of
reaction wheels; and advanced fringe detectors. The technology pioneered by
Star Watch, the first long-baseline Michelson interferometer in space,
represents an important investment in the future of space astronomy. NASA's
proposed Vision Missions (Exo-Earth, Black Hole and Cosmic Dawn Mappers)
require the use of precision interferometers.
No other Astrophysics Probe concept comes close to this level of technical
readiness. There are no analogs to Star Watch. It will provide access, for the

Title:An ALMA+ACA measurement of the shock in the Bullet Cluster,"
Abstract:  The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect presents a relatively new tool for
characterizing galaxy cluster merger shocks, traditionally studied through
X-ray observations. Widely regarded as the ""textbook example"" of a cluster
merger bow shock, the western shock front in the Bullet Cluster (1E0657-56)
represents the ideal test case for such an SZ study. We aim to reconstruct a
parametric model for the shock SZ signal by directly and jointly fitting deep,
high-resolution interferometric data from the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Atacama Compact Array (ACA) in
Fourier space. The ALMA+ACA data are primarily sensitive to the electron
pressure difference across the shock front. To estimate the shock Mach number
$M$, this difference can be combined with the value for the upstream electron
pressure derived from an independent Chandra X-ray analysis. In the case of
instantaneous electron-ion temperature equilibration, we find
$M=2.08^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$, in $\approx 2.4\sigma$ tension with the independent
constraint from Chandra, $M_X=2.74\pm0.25$. The assumption of purely adiabatic
electron temperature change across the shock leads to $M=2.53^{+0.33}_{-0.25}$,
in better agreement with the X-ray estimate $M_X=2.57\pm0.23$ derived for the
same heating scenario. We have demonstrated that interferometric observations
of the SZ effect provide constraints on the properties of the shock in the
Bullet Cluster that are highly complementary to X-ray observations. The
combination of X-ray and SZ data yields a powerful probe of the shock
properties, capable of measuring $M$ and addressing the question of
electron-ion equilibration in cluster shocks. Our analysis is however limited
by systematics related to the overall cluster geometry and the complexity of
the post-shock gas distribution. To overcome these limitations, a joint
analysis of SZ and X-ray data is needed.

distances $|z| < 3$ kpc. Known structures such as Gaia Enceladus and the Helmi
stream are identified. The largest previously-unknown structure, Nyx, is a vast
stream consisting of at least 90 stars in the region of interest. This study
displays the power of the machine learning approach by not only successfully
identifying known features, but also discovering new kinematic structures that
may shed light on the merger history of the Milky Way.

Title:Mapping the Stellar Halo with the H3 Spectroscopic Survey,"
Abstract:  Modern theories of galaxy formation predict that the Galactic stellar halo
was hierarchically assembled from the accretion and disruption of smaller
systems. This hierarchical assembly is expected to produce a high degree of
structure in the combined phase and chemistry space; this structure should
provide a relatively direct probe of the accretion history of our Galaxy.
Revealing this structure requires precise 3D positions (including distances),
3D velocities, and chemistry for large samples of stars. The Gaia satellite is
delivering proper motions and parallaxes for >1 billion stars to G~20. However,
radial velocities and metallicities will only be available to G~15, which is
insufficient to probe the outer stellar halo (>10 kpc). Moreover, parallaxes
will not be precise enough to deliver high-quality distances for stars beyond
~10 kpc. Identifying accreted systems throughout the stellar halo therefore
requires a large ground-based spectroscopic survey to complement Gaia. Here we
provide an overview of the H3 Stellar Spectroscopic Survey, which will deliver
precise stellar parameters and spectrophotometric distances for 200,000 stars
to r=18. Spectra are obtained with the Hectochelle instrument at the MMT, which
is configured for the H3 Survey to deliver resolution R~23,000 spectra covering
the wavelength range 5150A-5300A. The survey is optimized for stellar halo
science and therefore focuses on high Galactic latitude fields (|b|>30 deg.),
sparsely sampling 15,000 sq. degrees. Targets are selected on the basis of Gaia
parallaxes, enabling very efficient selection of bone fide halo stars. The
survey began in the Fall of 2017 and has collected 88,000 spectra to-date. All
of the data, including the derived stellar parameters, will eventually be made
publicly available via the survey website: this http URL.

Title:Optical Transient from an Explosion Close to the Stellar Surface,"
Abstract:  We study the hydrodynamic evolution of an explosion close to the stellar
surface, and give predictions for the radiation from such an event. We show
that such an event will give rise to a multi-wavelength transient. We apply
this model to describe a precursor burst to the peculiar supernova iPTF14hls,
which occurred in 1954, sixty year before the supernova. We propose that the
new generation of optical surveys might detect similar transients, and they can
be used to identify supernova progenitors well before the explosion.

Title:MINESweeper: Spectrophotometric Modeling of Stars in the Gaia Era,"
Abstract:  We present MINESweeper, a tool to measure stellar parameters by jointly
fitting observed spectra and broadband photometry to model isochrones and
spectral libraries. This approach enables the measurement of spectrophotometric
distances, in addition to stellar parameters such as Teff, log(g), [Fe/H],
[a/Fe], and radial velocity. MINESweeper employs a Bayesian framework and can
easily incorporate a variety of priors, including Gaia parallaxes. Mock data
are fit in order to demonstrate how the precision of derived parameters depends
on evolutionary phase and SNR. We then fit a selection of data in order to
validate the model outputs. Fits to a variety of benchmark stars including
Procyon, Arcturus, and the Sun result in derived stellar parameters that are in
good agreement with the literature. We then fit combined spectra and photometry
of stars in the open and globular clusters M92, M13, M3, M107, M71, and M67.
Derived distances, [Fe/H], [a/Fe], and log(g)-Teff, relations are in overall
good agreement with literature values, although there are trends between
metallicity and log(g), within clusters that point to systematic uncertainties
at the ~0.1 dex level. Finally, we fit a large sample of stars from the H3
Spectroscopic Survey in which high quality Gaia parallaxes are also available.
These stars are fit without the Gaia parallaxes so that the geometric
parallaxes can serve as an independent test of the spectrophotometric
distances. Comparison between the two reveals good agreement within their
formal uncertainties after accounting for the Gaia zero point uncertainties.

Title:Large Molecular Gas Reservoirs in Star Forming Cluster Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We present CO(2-1) observations of 72 galaxies in the nearby, disturbed
Antlia galaxy cluster with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope.
The galaxies in our sample are selected to span a wide range of stellar masses
($10^{8}M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$) and star
formation rates
($0.0005M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}<\text{SFR}<0.3M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$).
Reaching a depth of $23\text{mJy}$ in $50\text{km}\text{s}^{-1}$ channels, we
report a total CO detection rate of $37.5\%$ and a CO detection rate of $86\%$
for sources within 1 dex of the main sequence. We compare our sample with a
similar sample of galaxies in the field, finding that, for a fixed stellar mass
and SFR, galaxies in the Antlia cluster have comparable molecular gas
reservoirs to field galaxies. We find that $\sim41\%$ (11/27) of our CO
detections display non-Gaussian CO(2-1) emission line profiles, and a number of
these sources display evidence of quenching in their optical images. We also
find that the majority of our sample lie either just below, or far below the
main sequence of field galaxies, further hinting at potential ongoing
quenching. We conclude that the Antlia cluster represents an intermediate
environment between fields and dense clusters, where the gentler intracluster
medium (ICM) allows the cluster members to retain their reservoirs of molecular
gas, but in which the disturbed ICM is just beginning to influence the member
galaxies, resulting in high SFRs and possible ongoing quenching.

Title:Ultraviolet Mg II emission from fast neutral ejecta around Eta Carinae,"
Abstract:  We present the first images of the nebula around eta Carinae obtained with
HST/WFC3, including a UV image in the F280N filter that traces MgII emission,
plus contemporaneous imaging in the F336W, F658N, and F126N filters that trace
near-UV continuum, [NII], and [FeII], respectively. The F336W and F658N images
are consistent with previous images in these filters, and F126N shows that for
the most part, [FeII] 12567 traces clumpy shocked gas seen in [NII]. The F280N
image, however, reveals MgII emission from structures that have not been seen
in any previous line or continuum images of eta Carinae. This image shows
diffuse MgII emission immediately outside the bipolar Homunculus nebula in all
directions, but with the strongest emission concentrated over the poles. The
diffuse structure with prominent radial streaks, plus an anticorrelation with
ionized tracers of clumpy shocked gas, leads us to suggest that this is
primarily MgII resonant scattering from unshocked, neutral atomic gas. We
discuss the implied structure and geometry of the MgII emission, and its
relation to the Homunculus lobes and various other complex nebular structures.
An order of magnitude estimate of the neutral gas mass traced by MgII is
0.02Msun, with a corresponding kinetic energy around 1e47erg. This may provide
important constraints on polar mass loss in the early phases of the Great
Eruption. We argue that the MgII line may be an excellent tracer of significant
reservoirs of freely expanding, unshocked, and otherwise invisible neutral
atomic gas in a variety of stellar outflows.

Title:Sub-damped Lyman alpha systems in the XQ-100 survey I -- Identification and contribution to the cosmological HI budget,"
Abstract:  Sub-damped Lyman alpha systems (subDLAs; HI column densities of
19.0<=logN(HI)<20.3) are rarely included in the cosmic HI census performed at
redshifts z>=1.5, yet are expected to contribute significantly to the overall
HI mass budget of the Universe. In this paper, we present a blindly selected
sample of 155 subDLAs found along 100 quasar sightlines (with a redshift path
length X=475) in the XQ-100 survey to investigate the contribution of subDLAs
to the HI mass density of the Universe. The impact of X-Shooter's spectral
resolution on sub-DLA identification is evaluated, and found to be sufficient
for reliably finding absorbers with logN(HI)>=18.9. We compared the
implications of searching for subDLAs solely using HI absorption versus the use
of additional metal lines to confirm the identification, and found that
metal-selection techniques would have missed 75 subDLAs. Using a
bootstrap-Monte Carlo simulation, we computed the column density distribution
function (f(N,X)) and the cosmological HI mass density of subDLAs and compared
with our previous work based on the XQ-100 damped Lyman alpha systems. We do
not find any significant redshift evolution in f(N,X) or cosmological HI mass
density for subDLAs. However, subDLAs contribute 10-20 per cent of the total
cosmological HI mass density measured at redshifts 2<z<5 (agreeing with
previous measurements), and thus have a small but significant contribution to
the HI budget of the Universe.

Title:Extragalactic megahertz-peaked spectrum radio sources at milliarcsecond scales,"
Abstract:  Extragalactic peaked-spectrum radio sources are thought to be the progenitors
of larger, radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). Synchrotron self-absorption
(SSA) has often been identified as the cause of their spectral peak. The
identification of new megahertz-peaked spectrum sources from the GaLactic and
Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey provides an
opportunity to test how radio sources with spectral peaks below 1 GHz fit
within this evolutionary picture. We observed six peaked-spectrum sources
selected from the GLEAM survey, three that have spectral characteristics which
violate SSA and three that have spectral peaks below 230 MHz, with the Very
Long Baseline Array at 1.55 and 4.96 GHz. We present milliarcsecond resolution
images of each source and constrain their morphology, linear size, luminosity,
and magnetic field strength. Of the sources that are resolved by our study, the
sources that violate SSA appear to be compact doubles, while the sources with
peak frequencies below 230 MHz have core-jet features. We find that all of our
sources are smaller than expected from SSA by factors of >20. We also find that
component magnetic field strengths calculated from SSA are likely inaccurate,
differing by factors of >5 from equipartition estimates. The calculated
equipartition magnetic field strengths more closely resemble estimates from
previously studied gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources. Exploring a model of the
interaction between jets and the interstellar medium, we demonstrate that
free-free absorption (FFA) can accurately describe the linear sizes and peak
frequencies of our sources. Our findings support the theory that there is a
fraction of peaked-spectrum sources whose spectral peaks are best modelled by
FFA, implying our understanding of the early stages of radio AGN is incomplete.

Title:Untangling the Galaxy I: Local Structure and Star Formation History of the Milky Way,"
Abstract:  Gaia DR2 provides unprecedented precision in measurements of the distance and
kinematics of stars in the solar neighborhood. Through applying unsupervised
machine learning on DR2's 5-dimensional dataset (3d position + 2d velocity), we
identify a number of clusters, associations, and co-moving groups within 1 kpc
and $|b|<30^\circ$ (many of which have not been previously known). We estimate
their ages with the precision of $\sim$0.15 dex. Many of these groups appear to
be filamentary or string-like, oriented in parallel to the Galactic plane, and
some span hundreds of pc in length. Most of these string lack a central
cluster, indicating that their filamentary structure is primordial, rather than
the result of tidal stripping or dynamical processing. The youngest strings
($<$100 Myr) are orthogonal to the Local Arm. The older ones appear to be
remnants of several other arm-like structures that cannot be presently traced
by dust and gas. The velocity dispersion measured from the ensemble of groups
and strings increase with age, suggesting a timescale for dynamical heating of
$\sim$300 Myr. This timescale is also consistent with the age at which the
population of strings begins to decline, while the population in more compact
groups continues to increase, suggesting that dynamical processes are
disrupting the weakly bound string populations, leaving only individual
clusters to be identified at the oldest ages. These data shed a new light on
the local galactic structure and a large scale cloud collapse.

Title:Turbulence in the Local Interstellar Medium and the IBEX Ribbon,"
Abstract:  The effects of turbulence in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) have
been proposed by Giacalone & Jokipii (2015) to be important in determining the
structure of the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) ribbon via particle
trapping by magnetic mirroring. We further explore this effect by simulating
the motion of charged particles in a turbulent magnetic field superposed on a
large-scale mean field, which we have considered to be either spatially-uniform
or a mean field derived from a 3D MHD simulation. We find that the ribbon is
not double-peaked, in contrast to Giacalone & Jokipii (2015). However, the
magnetic mirror force still plays an important role in trapping particles.
Furthermore, the ribbon$'$s thickness is considerably larger if the large-scale
mean field is draped around the heliosphere. Voyager 1 observations in the
VLISM show a turbulent field component that is stronger than previously
thought, which we test in our simulation. We find that the inclusion of
turbulent fluctuations at scales ${\gtrsim}$100 au and power consistent with
Voyager 1 observations produces a ribbon whose large-scale structure is
inconsistent with IBEX observations. However, restricting the fluctuations to
${\sim}$10 au or smaller produces a smoother ribbon structure similar to IBEX
observations. Different turbulence realizations produce different small-scale
features ${\lesssim}10$ in the ribbon, but its large-scale structure is
robust if the maximum fluctuation size is ${\sim}$10 au. This suggests that the
magnetic field structure at scales ${\lesssim}$10 au is determined by the
heliosphere$'$s interaction with the VLISM and cannot entirely be represented
by homogeneous interstellar turbulence.

Abstract:  We describe plans for the development of the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray
Observatory (SWGO), a next-generation instrument with sensitivity to the
very-high-energy (VHE) band to be constructed in the Southern Hemisphere. SWGO
will provide wide-field coverage of a large portion of the southern sky,
effectively complementing current and future instruments in the global
multi-messenger effort to understand extreme astrophysical phenomena throughout
the universe. A detailed description of science topics addressed by SWGO is
available in the science case white paper [1]. The development of SWGO will
draw on extensive experience within the community in designing, constructing,
and successfully operating wide-field instruments using observations of
extensive air showers. The detector will consist of a compact inner array of
particle detection units surrounded by a sparser outer array. A key advantage
of the design of SWGO is that it can be constructed using current, already
proven technology. We estimate a construction cost of 54M USD and a cost of
7.5M USD for 5 years of operation, with an anticipated US contribution of 20M
USD ensuring that the US will be a driving force for the SWGO effort. The
recently formed SWGO collaboration will conduct site selection and detector
optimization studies prior to construction, with full operations foreseen to
begin in 2026. Throughout this document, references to science white papers

Title:Enabling the next generation of scientific discoveries by embracing photonic technologies,"
Abstract:  The fields of Astronomy and Astrophysics are technology limited, where the
advent and application of new technologies to astronomy usher in a flood of
discoveries altering our understanding of the Universe (e.g., recent cases
include LIGO and the GRAVITY instrument at the VLTI). Currently, the field of
astronomical spectroscopy is rapidly approaching an impasse: the size and cost
of instruments, especially multi-object and integral field spectrographs for
extremely large telescopes (ELTs), are pushing the limits of what is feasible,
requiring optical components at the very edge of achievable size and
performance. For these reasons, astronomers are increasingly looking for
innovative solutions like photonic technologies that promote instrument
miniaturization and simplification, while providing superior performance.
Astronomers have long been aware of the potential of photonic technologies.
The goal of this white paper is to draw attention to key photonic technologies
and developments over the past two decades and demonstrate there is new
momentum in this arena. We outline where the most critical efforts should be
focused over the coming decade in order to move towards realizing a fully
photonic instrument. A relatively small investment in this technology will
advance astronomical photonics to a level where it can reliably be used to
solve challenging instrument design limitations. For the benefit of both ground
and space borne instruments alike, an endorsement from the National Academy of
Sciences decadal survey will ensure that such solutions are set on a path to
their full scientific exploitation, which may one day address a broad range of
science cases outlined in the KSPs.

Title:Architectures of Exoplanetary Systems. I: A Clustered Forward Model for Exoplanetary Systems around Kepler's FGK Stars,"
Abstract:  Observations of exoplanetary systems provide clues about the intrinsic
distribution of planetary systems, their architectures, and how they formed. We
develop a forward modelling framework for generating populations of planetary
systems and ""observed"" catalogues by simulating the Kepler detection pipeline
(SysSim). We compare our simulated catalogues to the Kepler DR25 catalogue of
planet candidates, updated to include revised stellar radii from Gaia DR2. We
constrain our model based on the observed 1D marginal distributions of orbital
periods, period ratios, transit depths, transit depth ratios, transit
durations, transit duration ratios, and transit multiplicities. Models assuming
planets with independent periods and sizes do not adequately account for the
properties of the multiplanet systems. Instead, a clustered point process model
for exoplanet periods and sizes provides a significantly better description of
the Kepler population, particularly the observed multiplicity and period ratio
distributions. We find that $0.56^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ of FGK stars have at least
one planet larger than $0.5 R_\oplus$ between 3 and 300 d. Most of these
planetary systems ($\sim 98\%$) consist of one or two clusters with a median of
three planets per cluster. We find that the Kepler dichotomy is evidence for a
population of highly inclined planetary systems and is unlikely to be solely
due to a population of intrinsically single planet systems. We provide a large
ensemble of simulated physical and observed catalogues of planetary systems
from our models, as well as publicly available code for generating similar
catalogues given user-defined parameters.

Title:The Intrinsic Temperature and Radiative-Convective Boundary Depth in the Atmospheres of Hot Jupiters,"
Abstract:  In giant planet atmosphere modelling, the intrinsic temperature
$T_\mathrm{int}$ and radiative-convective boundary (RCB) are important lower
boundary conditions. Often in one-dimensional radiative-convective models and
in three-dimensional general circulation models it is assumed that
$T_\mathrm{int}$ is similar to that of Jupiter itself, around 100 K, which
yields a RCB around 1 kbar for hot Jupiters. In this work, we show that the
inflated radii, and hence high specific entropy interiors, of hot Jupiters
suggest much higher $T_\mathrm{int}$ values. Assuming the effect is primarily
due to current heating (rather than delayed cooling), we derive an equilibrium
relation between $T_\mathrm{eq}$ and $T_\mathrm{int}$, showing that the latter
can take values as high as 700 K. In response, the RCB moves upward in the
atmosphere. Using one-dimensional radiative-convective atmosphere models, we
find RCBs of only a few bars, rather than the kilobar typically supposed. This
much shallower RCB has important implications for the atmospheric structure,
vertical and horizontal circulation, interpretations of phase curves, and the
effect of deep cold traps on cloud formation.

Title:Heavy metals in intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs: The chemical composition of HZ44 and HD127493,"
Abstract:  Hot subluminous stars can be spectroscopically classified as subdwarf B (sdB)
and O (sdO) stars. While the latter are predominantly hydrogen deficient, the
former are mostly helium deficient. The atmospheres of most sdOs are almost
devoid of hydrogen, whereas a small group of hot subdwarf stars of mixed H/He
composition exists, showing extreme metal abundance anomalies. Whether such
intermediate helium-rich (iHe) subdwarf stars provide an evolutionary link
between the dominant classes is an open question. The presence of strong Ge,
Sn, and Pb lines in the UV spectrum of HZ$\,$44 suggests a strong enrichment of
heavy elements in this iHe-sdO star and calls for a detailed quantitative
spectral analysis focusing on trans-iron elements. Non-LTE model atmospheres
calculated with TLUSTY are combined with high-quality optical, UV and FUV
spectra of HZ$\,$44 and its hotter sibling HD$\,$127493 to determine their
atmospheric parameters and metal abundance patterns. By collecting atomic data
from literature we succeeded to determine abundances of 29 metals in HZ$\,$44,
including the trans-iron elements Ga, Ge, As, Se, Zr, Sn, and Pb and provide
upper limits for 10 other metals. This makes it the best described hot subdwarf
in terms of chemical composition. For HD$\,$127493 the abundance of 15 metals,
including Ga, Ge, and Pb and upper limits for another 16 metals were derived.
Heavy elements turn out to be overabundant by one to four orders of magnitude
with respect to the Sun. Zr and Pb are among the most enriched elements. The C,
N, and O abundance for both stars can be explained by nucleosynthesis of
hydrogen burning in the CNO cycle along with their helium enrichment. On the
other hand, the heavy-element anomalies are unlikely to be caused by
nucleosynthesis. Instead diffusion processes are evoked with radiative
levitation overcoming gravitational settlement of the heavy elements.

Title:Constraining the astrophysics and cosmology from 21cm tomography using deep learning with the SKA,"
Abstract:  Future Square Kilometre Array (SKA) surveys are expected to generate huge
datasets of 21cm maps on cosmological scales from the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR). We assess the viability of exploiting machine learning techniques,
namely, convolutional neural networks (CNN), to simultaneously estimate the
astrophysical and cosmological parameters from 21cm maps from semi-numerical
simulations. We further convert the simulated 21cm maps into SKA-like mock maps
using the detailed SKA antennae distribution, thermal noise and a recipe for
foreground cleaning. We successfully design two CNN architectures (VGGNet-like
and ResNet-like) that are both efficiently able to extract simultaneously three
astrophysical parameters, namely the photon escape fraction (f$_{\rm esc}$),
the ionizing emissivity power dependence on halo mass ($C_{\rm ion}$) and the
ionizing emissivity redshift evolution index ($D_{\rm ion}$), and three
cosmological parameters, namely the matter density parameter ($\Omega_{m}$),
the dimensionless Hubble constant ($h$), and the matter fluctuation amplitude
($\sigma_{8}$), from 21cm maps at several redshifts. With the presence of noise
from SKA, our designed CNNs are still able to recover these astrophysical and
cosmological parameters with great accuracy ($R^{2} > 92\%$), improving to
$R^{2} > 99\%$ towards low redshift and low neutral fraction values. Our
results show that future 21cm observations can play a key role to break
degeneracy between models and tightly constrain the astrophysical and
cosmological parameters, using only few frequency channels.

Abstract:  We present ALMA observations of organic molecules towards five low-mass Class
0/I protostellar disk candidates in the Serpens cluster. Three sources (Ser-emb

CH3OCHO, and CH2CO, while NH2CHO is detected in just Ser-emb 8 and Ser-emb 17.
Detecting hot corino-type chemistry in three of five sources represents a high
occurrence rate given the relative sparsity of these sources in the literature,
and this suggests a possible link between protostellar disk formation and hot
corino formation. For sources with CH3OH detections, we derive column densities
of 10^{17}-10^{18} cm^{-2} and rotational temperatures of ~200-250 K. The
CH3OH-normalized column density ratios of large, oxygen-bearing COMs in the
Serpens sources and other hot corinos span two orders of magnitude,
demonstrating a high degree of chemical diversity at the hot corino stage.
Resolved observations of a larger sample of objects are needed to understand
the origins of chemical diversity in hot corinos, and the relationship between
different protostellar structural elements on disk-forming scales.

obtained at the Gemini North telescope for nine late-T and Y dwarfs, and
synthesize L' from spectra for an additional two dwarfs. The targets include
two binary systems which were imaged at a resolution of 0.25"". One of these,
WISEP J045853.90+643452.6AB, shows significant motion, and we present an
astrometric analysis of the binary using Hubble Space Telescope, Keck Adaptive
Optics, and Gemini images. We compare lambda ~4um observations to models, and
find that the model fluxes are too low for brown dwarfs cooler than ~700K. The
discrepancy increases with decreasing temperature, and is a factor of ~2 at
T_eff=500K and ~4 at T_eff=400K. Warming the upper layers of a model atmosphere
generates a spectrum closer to what is observed. The thermal structure of cool
brown dwarf atmospheres above the radiative-convective boundary may not be
adequately modelled using pure radiative equilibrium; instead heat may be
introduced by thermochemical instabilities (previously suggested for the L- to
T-type transition) or by breaking gravity waves (previously suggested for the
solar system giant planets). One-dimensional models may not capture these
atmospheres, which likely have both horizontal and vertical
pressure/temperature variations.

Abstract:  Kepler, K2, TESS, and similar time-domain photometric projects, while
designed with exoplanet detection in mind, are also well-suited projects for
searches for large artificial structures orbiting other stars in the Galaxy. An
effort to examine these data sets with an eye towards non-spherical or
otherwise anomalous transit events, and a robust follow-up program to
understand the stars and occulters that generate them, would enable the first
robust upper limits on such megastructures in terms of their sizes, occurrence
rates, and orbital properties. Such work also has the ancillary benefit of
improving our understanding of stellar photometric variability and orbital and
physical parameter estimation of exoplanets from photometric time series, and
may lead to the identification of new, unexpected classes of stellar variables
and exoplanets. Ultimately, searching for the most unusual and anomalous
signatures benefits not only the search for technologies, but also the entire
astronomical community by uncovering new mysteries to advance our understanding
of the Universe.

Title:Searches for Technosignatures: The State of the Profession,"
Abstract:  The search for life in the universe is a major theme of astronomy and
astrophysics for the next decade. Searches for technosignatures are
complementary to searches for biosignatures, in that they offer an alternative
path to discovery, and address the question of whether complex (i.e.
technological) life exists elsewhere in the Galaxy. This approach has been
endorsed in prior Decadal Reviews and National Academies reports, and yet the
field still receives almost no federal support in the US. Because of this lack
of support, searches for technosignatures, precisely the part of the search of
greatest public interest, suffers from a very small pool of trained
practitioners. A major source of this issue is institutional inertia at NASA,
which avoids the topic as a result of decades-past political grandstanding,
conflation of the effort with non-scientific topics such as UFOs, and confusion
regarding the scope of the term ""SETI."" The Astro2020 Decadal should address
this issue by making developing the field an explicit priority for the next
decade. It should recommend that NASA and the NSF support training and
curricular development in the field in a way that supports equity and
diversity, and make explicit calls for proposals to fund searches for
technosignatures.

Title:Active galactic nuclei feedback at parsec scale,"
Abstract:  We perform simulations to study the effects of active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
radiation and wind feedback on the properties of slowly rotating accretion flow
at parsec scale. We find that when only radiative feedback is considered,
outflows can be produced by the radiation pressure due to Thomson scattering.
The mass flux of outflow is comparable to that of inflow. Although strong
outflow is present, the luminosity of AGN can be easily super-Eddington. When
wind feedback is also taken into account, the mass flux of outflow does not
change much. Consequently, the luminosity of the central AGN can still be
super-Eddington. However, observations show that the luminosity of most AGNs is
sub-Eddington. Some other mechanisms are needed to reduce the AGNs luminosity.
Although the mass outflow rate does not change much by wind feedback, other
properties of outflow (density, temperature, velocity and kinetic power) can be
significantly changed by wind feedback. In the presence of wind feedback, the
density of outflow becomes significantly lower, temperature of outflow becomes
significantly higher, velocity of outflow is increased by one order of
magnitude, the kinetic power of outflow is increased by a factor of $40-100$.

Title:New constraints on the mass bias of galaxy clusters from the power spectra of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and cosmic shear,"
Abstract:  Thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) power spectrum is a powerful probe of the
present-day amplitude of matter density fluctuations, and has been measured up
to $\ell\approx 10^3$ from the {\it Planck} data. The largest systematic
uncertainty in the interpretation of this data is the so-called ""mass bias""
parameter $B$, which relates the true halo mass to the mass proxy used by the
{\it Planck} team as $M_{\rm 500c}^{Planck}=M_{\rm 500c}^{\rm true}/B$. Since
the power spectrum of the cosmic weak lensing shear is also sensitive to the
amplitude of matter density fluctuations via $S_8\equiv \sigma_8
\Omega_m^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha\sim 0.5$, we can break the degeneracy between
the mass bias and the cosmological parameters by combining the tSZ and cosmic
shear power spectra. In this paper, we perform a joint likelihood analysis of
the tSZ power spectrum from {\it Planck} and the cosmic shear power spectrum
from Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our analysis does not use the primordial cosmic
microwave background (CMB) information. We obtain a new constraint on the mass
bias as $B = 1.37 ^{+0.15}_{-0.23}$ or $(1-b) = B^{-1}=0.73^{+0.08}_{-0.13}$
(68\%~C.L.), for $\sigma_8 < 0.9$. This value of $B$ is lower than that needed
to reconcile the tSZ data with the primordial CMB and CMB lensing data, i.e.,
$B = 1.64 \pm 0.19$, but is consistent with the mass bias expected from
hydrodynamical simulations, $B = 1.28 \pm 0.20$. Our results thus indicate that
the mass bias is consistent with the non-thermal pressure support from mass
accretion of galaxy clusters via the cosmic structure formation, and that the
cosmologies inferred from the tSZ and the cosmic shear are consistent with each
other.

Title:Jet-driven bubbles in Fanaroff-Riley type I sources,"
Abstract:  Observations of several Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type I sources reveal outflowing
bipolar bubbles of hot gas surrounded by a weak forward shock. We consider the
possibility that these bubbles were driven by choked relativistic jets which
failed to penetrate the ambient intracluster medium (ICM). Using new results on
choked jets linking the geometry of the forward shock to the jet properties, we
infer robust limits on the radius $R_{ch}$ at which the jet was quenched in 5
well-studied FRI sources, finding typically $R_{ch}\sim 10$ kpc. We further
show that, in order to reach this radius in less than the current age of the
system, the jet must have been tightly collimated, with the jet head subtending
an angle of $\theta_h < 2^\circ$. The ambient pressure is not high enough to
explain this collimation, suggesting that the jet was collimated by interaction
with its own cocoon. Although the choking radius is well-constrained, we find a
degeneracy between the initial jet opening angle before collimation,
$\theta_0$, and the duration of jet activity, $t_b$, with
$(t_b/1\rm{Myr})(\theta_0/5^\circ)^{-2} \sim 0.1$. We speculate that the
working time and/or opening angle of the jet may be important factors
contributing to the FR type I/type II morphology in galaxy clusters, with
short-lived or wide jets being choked to form bipolar bubbles filled with
diffuse radio emission, and longer-lived or narrow jets successfully escaping
the cluster core to produce cocoons with radio hotspots.

Title:Corrugated Features in Coronal-mass-ejections-driven Shocks: A Discussion on the Predisposition to Particle Acceleration,"
Abstract:  The study of the acceleration of particles is an essential element of
research in the heliospheric science. Here, we discuss the predisposition to
the particle acceleration around coronal mass ejections (CMEs)-driven shocks
with corrugated wave-like features. We adopt these attributes on shocks formed
from disturbances due to the bimodal solar wind, CME deflection, irregular CME
expansion, and the ubiquitous fluctuations in the solar corona. In order to
understand the role of a wavy shock in particle acceleration, we define three
initial smooth shock morphologies each one associated with a fast CME. Using
polar Gaussian profiles we model these shocks in the low corona. We establish
the corrugated appearance on smooth shock by using combinations of wave-like
functions that represent the disturbances from medium and CME piston. For both
shock types, smooth and corrugated, we calculate the shock normal angles
between the shock normal and the radial upstream coronal magnetic field in
order to classify the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular regions. We
consider that corrugated shocks are predisposed to different process of
particle acceleration due to irregular distributions of shock normal angles
around of the shock. We suggest that disturbances due to CME irregular
expansion may be a decisive factor in origin of particle acceleration. Finally,
we regard that accepting these features on shocks may be the start point for
investigating some questions in the sheath and shock, like downstream-jets,
instabilities, shock thermalization, shock stability, and injection particle
process.

Title:Molecular complexity in the interstellar medium,"
Abstract:  The search for complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) has
revealed species of ever greater complexity. This search relies on the progress
made in the laboratory to characterize their rotational spectra. Our
understanding of the processes that lead to molecular complexity in the ISM
builds on numerical simulations that use chemical networks fed by laboratory
and theoretical studies. The advent of ALMA and NOEMA has opened a new door to
explore molecular complexity in the ISM. Their high angular resolution reduces
the spectral confusion of star-forming cores and their increased sensitivity
allows the detection of low-abundance molecules that could not be probed
before. The complexity of the recently-detected molecules manifests itself not
only in terms of number of atoms but also in their molecular structure. We
discuss these developments and report on ReMoCA, a new spectral line survey
performed with ALMA toward the high-mass star-forming region Sgr B2(N).

"Title:GK Car and GZ Nor: Two low-luminous, depleted RV Tauri stars","
Abstract:  We performed a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of two RV Tauri stars
GK Car and GZ Nor. Both objects are surrounded by hot circumstellar dust. Their
pulsation periods, derived from ASAS photometric time series, have been used to
derive their luminosities and distances via the PLC relation. In addition, for
both objects, GAIA distances are available. The Gaia distances and luminosities
are consistent with the values obtained from the PLC relationship. GK Car is at
distance of 4.5$\pm{1.3}$ kpc and has a luminosity of 1520$\pm{840}$
L$_{\odot}$, while GZ Nor is at distance of 8.4$\pm{2.3}$ kpc and has a
luminosity of 1240 $\pm{690}$ L$_{\odot}$. Our abundance analysis reveals that
both stars show depletion of refractory elements with [Fe/H]=$-$1.3 and
[Zn/Ti]=$+$1.2 for GK Car and [Fe/H]=$-$2.0 and [Zn/Ti]=$+$0.8 for GZ Nor. In
the WISE colour-colour diagram, GK Car is located in the RV Tauri box as
originally defined by \cite{evans85} and updated by \cite{gezer15}, while GZ
Nor is not. Despite this, we argue that both objects are surrounded by a
gravitationally bound disc. As depletion is observed in binaries, we postulate
that both stars are binaries as well. RV Tauri stars are generally acknowledged
to be post$-$AGB stars. Recent studies show that they might be either indeed
post$-$AGB or post$-$RGB objects depending on their luminosity. For both
objects, the derived luminosities are relatively low for post-AGB objects,
however, the uncertainties are quite large. We conclude that they could be
either post-RGB or post-AGB objects.

Title:Fast Radio Burst Injection Tests,"
Abstract:  Searches for fast radio bursts (FRBs) are underway at a growing number of
radio telescopes worldwide. The sample size is now sufficient to enable many
investigations into the population properties. As such, understanding the true
sensitivity thresholds, effective observing time expended, survey completeness
and parameter space coverage has become vital for calibrating the observed
distributions. Recently the Molonglo FRB search team reported on their, as yet
unique, efforts to inject synthetic FRB signals into their telescope data
streams. Their results show 10 percent of injections being missed, even at very
high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios. Their pipeline employs components considered
standard across several telescopes so that the result is potentially alarming.
In this paper we present a further look at these missed injections. It is shown
that all of the missed injections can be explained by combinations of the noise
statistics, mis-labelling, overly harsh data analysis cuts, incorrect S/N
calculations and radio frequency interference. There is no need to be alarmed.

Title:Magnetic Power Spectra of Emerging Active Regions,"
Abstract:  Magnetic field data provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory were utilized to explore the changes in the
magnetic energy of four active regions (ARs) during their emergence. We found
that at the very early stage of the magnetic flux emergence, an abrupt
steepening of the magnetic power spectrum takes place leading to rapid increase
of the absolute value of the negative spectra power index $\alpha$ in $E(k)$
$\sim$ $k^{\alpha}$. As the emergence proceeds, the energy increases at all
scales simultaneously implying that elements of all sizes do appear in the
photosphere. Meanwhile, the energy gain at scales larger than $\approx$10 Mm
prevails as compared to that at smaller scales. Both direct (i.e.,
fragmentation of large structures into smaller ones) and inverse (i.e., merging
of small magnetic features into larger elements) cascades are readily observed
during the emergence. However, in the case of inverse cascade, the total energy
gained at large scales exceeds the energy loss at smaller scales assuming
simultaneous appearance of large-scale magnetic entities from beneath the
photosphere. We conclude that most of the time the energy may grow at all
scales. We also cannot support the point of view regarding the dominant role of
the inverse cascade in the formation of an AR. Although the coalescence of
small magnetic elements into larger pores and sunspots is observed, our
analysis shows that the prevailed energy contribution to an AR comes from
emergence of large-scale structures.

Title:Revisiting a negative cosmological constant from low-redshift data,"
Abstract:  Persisting tensions between high-redshift and low-redshift cosmological
observations suggest the dark energy sector of the Universe might be more
complex than the positive cosmological constant of the $\Lambda$CDM model.
Motivated by string theory, wherein symmetry considerations make consistent AdS
backgrounds (\textit (i.e.) maximally symmetric spacetimes with a negative
cosmological constant) ubiquitous, we explore a scenario where the dark energy
sector consists of two components: a negative cosmological constant, with a
dark energy component with equation of state $w_{\phi}$ on top. We test the
consistency of the model against low-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and
Type Ia Supernovae distance measurements, assessing two alternative choices of
distance anchors: the sound horizon at baryon drag determined by the
\textit{Planck} collaboration, and the Hubble constant determined by the SH0ES
program. We find no evidence for a negative cosmological constant, and mild
indications for an effective phantom dark energy component on top. A model
comparison analysis reveals the $\Lambda$CDM model is favoured over our
negative cosmological constant model. While our results are inconclusive,
should low-redshift tensions persist with future data, it would be worth
reconsidering and further refining our toy negative cosmological constant model
by considering realistic string constructions.

"Title:Quantifying the relationship between Moreton-Ramsey waves and ""EIT waves"" using observations of 4 homologous wave events","
Abstract:  Freely-propagating global waves in the solar atmosphere are commonly observed
using Extreme UltraViolet passbands (EUV or ""EIT waves""), and less regularly in
H-alpha (Moreton-Ramsey waves). Despite decades of research, joint observations
of EUV and Moreton-Ramsey waves remain rare, complicating efforts to quantify
the connection between these phenomena. We present observations of four
homologous global waves originating from the same active region between 28-30
March 2014 and observed using both EUV and H-alpha data. Each global EUV wave
was observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, with the associated
Moreton-Ramsey waves identified using the Global Oscillations Network Group
(GONG) network. All of the global waves exhibit high initial velocity (e.g.,
842-1388 km s$^{-1}$ in the 193A passband) and strong deceleration (e.g., -1437
- -782 m s$^{-2}$ in the 193A passband) in each of the EUV passbands studied,
with the EUV wave kinematics exceeding those of the Moreton-Ramsey wave. The
density compression ratio of each global wave was estimated using both
differential emission measure and intensity variation techniques, with both
indicating that the observed waves were weakly shocked with a fast magnetosonic
Mach number slightly greater than one. This suggests that, according to current
models, the global coronal waves were not strong enough to produce
Moreton-Ramsey waves, indicating an alternative explanation for these
observations. Instead, we conclude that the evolution of the global waves was
restricted by the surrounding coronal magnetic field, in each case producing a
downward-angled wavefront propagating towards the north solar pole which
perturbed the chromosphere and was observed as a Moreton-Ramsey wave.

Title:The Cherenkov Telescope Array Performance in Divergent Mode,"
Abstract:  Two of the Key Science Projects of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)
consist in performing a deep survey of the Galactic and Extragalactic sky,
providing an unbiased view of the Universe at energies above tens of GeV. To
optimize the time spent to perform the Extragalactic survey, a so-called
""divergent mode"" of the CTA was proposed as an alternative observation strategy
to the traditional parallel pointing in order to increase its instantaneous
field of view. The search for transient VHE sources would also benefit from an
extended field of view. In the divergent mode, each telescope points to a
position in the sky that is slightly offset, in the outward direction, from the
center of the field of view. In this contribution, we present the first
performance estimation from full Monte Carlo simulation of possible CTA
divergent mode setups.

Title:InfraRed Astronomy Satellite Swarm Interferometry (IRASSI): Overview and Study Results,"
Abstract:  The far-infrared (FIR) is one of the few wavelength ranges where no
astronomical data with sub-arcsec resolution exist yet. Neither of the
medium-term satellite projects like SPICA, Millimetron or OST will resolve this
malady. Information at high spatial and spectral resolution in the FIR, taken
from atomic fine-structure lines, highly excited CO, and especially from water
lines would, however, open the door for transformative science. This calls for
interferometric concepts. We present first results of our feasibility study
IRASSI (Infrared Astronomy Satellite Swarm Interferometry) for a FIR space
interferometer. Extending on the principal concept of the ESPRIT study, it
features heterodyne interferometry within a swarm of 5 satellite elements. The
satellites can drift in and out within a range of several hundred meters,
thereby achieving spatial resolutions of <0.1"" over the whole wavelength range
of 1-6 THz. Precise knowledge on the baselines will be ensured by metrology
methods employing laser-based optical frequency combs, for which preliminary
ground-based tests have been designed by us. We first show how the science
requirements translate into operational and design parameters. We have put much
emphasis on the navigational aspects of such a free-flying satellite swarm
operating in relatively close vicinity. We hence present work on the formation
geometry, the relative dynamics of the swarm, and aspects of our investigation
towards attitude estimation. Furthermore, we discuss issues regarding the
real-time capability of the autonomous relative positioning system, which is an
important aspect for IRASSI where, due to the large raw data rates expected,
the interferometric correlation has to be done onboard. We also address
questions regarding the spacecraft architecture and how a thermomechanical
model is used to study the effect of thermal perturbations on the spacecraft.

Abstract:  We study binary mergers of ultralight bosonic dark matter cores by solving
the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson system of equations. The analysis centers on the
dynamics of the relaxation process and the behavior of the configuration
resulting from the merger, including the Gravitational Cooling with its
corresponding emission of mass and angular momentum. The oscillations of
density and size of the final configuration are characterized, indicating that
for the equal mass case the dependency of the amplitude and frequency of these
oscillations on the impact parameter of the pre-merger configuration is linear.
The amplitude of these oscillations changes by a factor of two or more
indicating the final configuration does not approach a clear stationary state
even though it oscillates around a virialized state. For the unequal mass case,
global quantities also indicate the final configuration oscillates around a
virialized state, although the density does not show a dominant oscillation
mode. The evolution of the angular momentum prior and post merger is analyzed
in all cases.

Abstract:  We derive the circular velocity curves of the gaseous and stellar discs of
UGC 4056, a giant barred galaxy with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We
analyse UGC 4056 using the 2D spectroscopy obtained within the framework of the
Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey. Using images and the colour
index g-r from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we determined the tilt of
the galaxy, which allows us to conclude that the galaxy rotates clockwise with
trailing spiral arms. We found that the gas motion at the central part of the
UGC 4056 shows peculiar features. The rotation velocity of the gaseous disc
shows a bump within around three kiloparsecs while the rotation velocity of the
stellar disc falls smoothly to zero with decreasing galactocentric distance. We
demonstrate that the peculiar radial velocities in the central part of the
galaxy may be caused by the inflow of the gas towards the nucleus of the
galaxy. The unusual motion of the gas takes place at the region with the
AGN-like radiation and can be explained by the gas response to the bar
potential.

Title:Supernovae in massive binaries and compact object mergers near supermassive black holes,"
Abstract:  Nuclear star clusters that surround supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in
galactic nuclei are among the densest systems in the Universe, harbouring
millions of stars and compact objects (COs). Within a few parsecs from the
SMBH, stars can form binaries. In this paper, we model the supernova (SN)
process of massive binaries that are born in proximity of the SMBH and that
produce CO binaries. These binaries can later merge via emission of
gravitational waves as a consequence of the Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We study the
dynamical evolution of these systems by means of high-precision $N$-body
simulations, including post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to 2.5PN order. We adopt
different prescriptions for the natal velocity kicks imparted during the SN
processes and find that larger kicks lead to more compact binaries that merge
closer to the SMBH. We also conclude that most of the mergers enter the LIGO
band with very high eccentricities. Finally, we compute a merger rate of
$0.05$--$0.07\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, $0.04$--$2\times 10^{-3}\
\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, $9.6\times 10^{-6}$--$2.7\times 10^{-3}\
\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for BH-BH, BH-NS, NS-NS, respectively,
smaller than the actual LIGO-Virgo observed rate.

Title:Cosmological searches for the neutrino mass scale and mass ordering,"
Abstract:  In this thesis, I describe a number of recent important developments in
neutrino cosmology on three fronts. Firstly, focusing on Large-Scale Structure
(LSS) data, I will show that current cosmological probes contain a wealth of
information on the sum of the neutrino masses. I report on the analysis leading
to the currently best upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses of
$0.12\,{\rm eV}$. I show how cosmological data exhibits a weak preference for
the normal neutrino mass ordering because of parameter space volume effects,
and propose a simple method to quantify this preference. Secondly, I will
discuss how galaxy bias represents a severe limitation towards fully
capitalizing on the neutrino information hidden in LSS data. I propose a method
for calibrating the scale-dependent galaxy bias using CMB lensing-galaxy
cross-correlations. Moreover, in the presence of massive neutrinos, the usual
definition of bias becomes inadequate, as it leads to a scale-dependence on
large scales which has never been accounted for. I show that failure to define
the bias appropriately will be a problem for future LSS surveys, and propose a
simple recipe to account for the effect of massive neutrinos on galaxy bias.
Finally, I discuss implications of correlations between neutrino parameters and
other cosmological parameters. In non-phantom dynamical dark energy models, the
upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses becomes tighter than the
$\Lambda$CDM limit. Therefore, such models exhibit an even stronger preference
for the normal ordering, and their viability could be jeopardized should
near-future laboratory experiments determine that the mass ordering is
inverted. I then discuss correlations between neutrino and inflationary
parameters. I find that our determination of inflationary parameters is stable
against assumptions about the neutrino sector. (abridged)

Title:Constraining churning and blurring in the Milky Way using large spectroscopic surveys -- an exploratory study,"
Abstract:  We have investigated the possibilities to quantify how much stars move in the
Milky Way stellar disk due to diffuse processes (i.e. so called blurring) and
due to influences from spiral arms and the bar (i.e. so called churning). To
this end we assume that it is possible to infer the formation radius of a star
if we know their elemental abundances and age as well as the metallicity
profile of the interstellar medium at the time of the formation of the star.
Using this information, coupled with orbital information derived from Gaia DR2
data and radial velocities from large spectroscopic surveys, we show that it is
possible to isolate stellar samples such that we can start to quantify how
important the role of churning is. We use data from APOGEE DR14, parallaxes
from Gaia and stellar ages based on C and N elemental abundances in the stars.
In our sample, we find that about half of the stars have experienced some sort
of radial migration (based solely on their orbital properties), 10 % have
likely have suffered only from churning, whilst a modest 5-7 % of stars have
never experienced either churning or blurring making them ideal tracers of the
original properties of the cool stellar disk. Our investigation shows that it
is possible to put up a framework where we can begin to quantify churning and
blurring an important. Important aspects for future work would include to
investigate how selection effects should be accounted for.

Title:Wave heating in simulated multi-stranded coronal loops,"
Abstract:  It has been found that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) induced by both
transverse and torsional oscillations in coronal loops can reinforce the
effects of wave heating. In this study, we model a coronal loop as a system of
individual strands, and we study wave heating effects by considering a combined
transverse and torsional driver at the loop footpoint. We deposit the same
energy into the multi-stranded loop and an equivalent monolithic loop, and then
observe a faster increase in the internal energy and temperature in the
multi-stranded model. Therefore, the multi-stranded model is more efficient in
starting the heating process. Moreover, higher temperature is observed near the
footpoint in the multi-stranded loop and near the apex in the monolithic loop.
The apparent heating location in the multi-stranded loop agrees with the
previous predictions and observations. Given the differences in the results
from our multi-stranded loop and monolithic loop simulations, and given that
coronal loops are suggested to be multi-stranded on both theoretical and
observational grounds, our results suggest that the multi-strandedness of
coronal loops needs to be incorporated in future wave-based heating mechanisms.

Abstract:  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be able to perform unprecedented

generation (SAG) pipeline, with a required 30 second latency, will allow the
discovery or follow-up of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and flaring emission from
active galactic nuclei, galactic compact objects and electromagnetic
counterparts of gravitational waves or neutrino messengers. The CTA sensitivity
for very short exposures does not only depend on the technological performance
of the array (e.g. effective area, background discrimination efficiency). The
algorithms to evaluate the significance of the detection also define the
sensitivity, together with their computational efficiency in order to satisfy
the SAG latency requirements. We explore the aperture photometry and likelihood
analysis techniques, and the associated parameters (e.g. on-source to
off-source exposure ratio, minimum number of required signal events), defining
the CTA ability to detect a significant signal at short exposures. The
resulting CTA differential flux sensitivity as a function of the observing
time, obtained using the latest Monte Carlo simulations, is compared to the
sensitivities of Fermi-LAT and current-generation IACTs obtained in the

radiation, partially ionize neutral hydrogen during the dark ages. Corrections
to the ionization fraction of neutral hydrogen induced by cosmic strings could
lead to new observational effects and/or new constraints on the string tension
around $G\mu \sim 10^{-16} - 10^{-22}$ for values of the primordial magnetic
field in the range $B_0 \sim 10^{-11}-10^{-9}$ Gauss.

Title:A scenario for ultra-diffuse satellite galaxies with low velocity dispersions: the case of [KKS 2000]04,"
Abstract:  A scenario for achieving a low velocity dispersion for the galaxy [KKS
2000]04 (aka NGC 1052-DF2) and similar galaxies is presented.
A progenitor halo corresponding to a $z=0$ halo of mass $\sim 5\times
10^{10}\; \textrm{M}_\odot$ and a low concentration parameter (but consistent
with cosmological simulations) infalls onto a Milky Way-size host at early
times. {Substantial removal of cold gas} from the inner regions by supernova
feedback and ram pressure, assisted by tidal stripping of the dark matter in
the outer regions, leads to a substantial reduction of the velocity dispersion
of stars within one effective radius. In this framework, the observed stellar
content of [KKS 2000]04 is associated with a progenitor mass close to that
inferred from the global stellar-to-halo-mass ratio. As far as the implications
of kinematics are concerned, even if at a $\sim 20 $ Mpc distance, it is argued
that [KKS 2000]04 is no more peculiar than numerous early type galaxies with
seemingly little total dark-matter content.

Title:Embedding Climate Change Engagement in Astronomy Education and Research,"
Abstract:  This White Paper is a call to action for astronomers to respond to climate
change with a large structural transition within our profession. Many
astronomers are deeply concerned about climate change and act upon it in their
personal and professional lives, and many organizations within astronomy have
incorporated incremental changes. We need a collective impact model to better
network and grow our efforts so that we can achieve results that are on the
scale appropriate to address climate change at the necessary level indicated by
scientific research; e.g., becoming carbon neutral by 2050. We need to
implement strategies within two primary drivers of our field: (1) Education and
Outreach, and (2) Research Practices and Infrastructure. (1) In the classroom
and through public talks, astronomers reach a large audience. Astronomy is
closely connected to the science of climate change, and it is arguably the most
important topic we include in our curriculum. Due to misinformation and
disinformation, climate change communication is different than for other areas
of science. We therefore need to expand our communication and implement
effective strategies, for which there is now a considerable body of research.
(2) On a per-person basis astronomers have an outsized carbon impact. There are
numerous ways we can reduce our footprint; e.g., in the design and operation of
telescope facilities and in the optimization and reduction of travel.
Fortunately, many of these solutions are win-win scenarios, e.g., increasing
the online presence of conferences will reduce the carbon footprint while
increasing participation, especially for astronomers working with fewer
financial resources. Astronomers have an obligation to act on climate change in
every way possible, and we need to do it now. In this White Paper, we outline a
plan for collective impact using a Networked Improvement Community (NIC)
approach.

Title:First detections of H13CO+ and HC15N in the disk around HD 97048: Evidence for a cold gas reservoir in the outer disk,"
Abstract:  Observations of different molecular lines in protoplanetary disks provide
valuable information on the gas kinematics, as well as constraints on the
radial density and temperature structure of the gas. With ALMA we have detected
H13CO+ (J=4-3) and HC15N (J=4-3) in the HD97048 protoplanetary disk for the
first time. We compare these new detections to the ringed continuum mm-dust
emission and the spatially resolved CO (J=3-2) and HCO+ (J=4-3) emission. The
radial distributions of the H13CO+ and HC15N emission show hints of ringed
sub-structure whereas, the optically thick tracers, CO and HCO+, do not. We
calculate the HCO+/H13CO+ intensity ratio across the disk and find that it is
radially constant (within our uncertainties). We use a physio-chemical
parametric disk structure of the HD97048 disk with an analytical prescription
for the HCO+ abundance distribution to generate synthetic observations of the
HCO+ and H13CO+ disk emission assuming LTE. The best by-eye fit models require
radial variations in the HCO+/H13CO+ abundance ratio and an overall enhancement
in H13CO+ relative to HCO+. This highlights the need to consider isotope
selective chemistry and in particular low temperature carbon isotope exchange
reactions. This also points to the presence of a reservoir of cold molecular
gas in the outer disk (T < 10K, R > 200au). Chemical models are required to
confirm that isotope-selective chemistry alone can explain the observations
presented here. With these data, we cannot rule out that the known dust
substructure in the HD97048 disk is responsible for the observed trends in
molecular line emission, and higher spatial resolution observations are
required to fully explore the potential of optically thin tracers to probe
planet-carved dust gaps. We also report non-detections of H13CO+ and HC15N in
the HD100546 protoplanetary disk.

Title:The blackholic quantum,"
Abstract:  We show that the high-energy emission of GRBs originates in the ""inner
engine"": a Kerr black hole (BH) surrounded by matter and a magnetic field
$B_0$. It radiates a sequence of discrete events of particle acceleration, each
of energy ${\cal E} = \hbar\,\Omega_{\rm eff}$, the \textit{blackholic
quantum}, where $\Omega_{\rm eff} =4(m_{\rm
Pl}/m_n)^8(c\,a/G\,M)(B_0^2/\rho_{\rm Pl})\Omega_+$. Here $M$, $a=J/M$,
$\Omega_+=c^2\partial M/\partial J=(c^2/G)\,a/(2 M r_+)$ and $r_+$ are the BH
mass, angular momentum per unit mass, angular velocity and horizon; $m_n$ is
the neutron mass, $m_{\rm Pl}$, $\lambda_{\rm Pl}=\hbar/(m_{\rm Pl}c)$ and
$\rho_{\rm Pl}=m_{\rm Pl}c^2/\lambda_{\rm Pl}^3$, are the Planck mass, length
and energy density. {Here and in the following use CGS-Gaussian units}. The
time\-scale of each process is $\tau_{\rm el}\sim \Omega_+^{-1}$, {along the
rotation axis, while it is much shorter off-axis owing to energy losses such as
synchrotron radiation}. We show an analogy with the Zeeman and Stark effects,
properly scaled from microphysics to macrophysics, that allows us to define the
""BH magneton"", $\mu_{\rm BH}=(m_{\rm Pl}/m_n)^4(c\,a/G\,M)e\,\hbar/(M c)$. We
give quantitative estimates for GRB 130427A adopting $M=2.3~M_\odot$, $c\,
a/(G\,M)= 0.47$ and $B_0= 3.5\times 10^{10}$ G. Each emitted ""quantum"", ${\cal
E}\sim 10^{37}$ erg, extracts only $10^{-16}$ times the BH rotational energy,
guaranteeing that the process can be repeated for thousands of years. The
""inner engine"" can also work in AGN as we here exemplified for the supermassive
BH at the center of M87.

"Title:Laboratory rotational spectroscopy of isotopic acetone, CH$_3^{13}$C(O)CH$_3$ and $^{13}$CH$_3$C(O)CH$_3$, and astronomical search in Sagittarius B2(N2)","
Abstract:  We want to study the rotational spectra of CH$_3^{13}$C(O)CH$_3$ and
$^{13}$CH$_3$C(O)CH$_3$ and search for them in Sagittarius B2(N2). We
investigated the laboratory rotational spectrum of isotopically enriched
CH$_3^{13}$C(O)CH$_3$ between 40 GHz and 910 GHz and of acetone between 36 GHz
and 910 GHz in order to study $^{13}$CH$_3$C(O)CH$_3$ in natural isotopic
composition. In addition, we searched for emission lines produced by these
species in a molecular line survey of Sagittarius B2(N) carried out with ALMA.
Discrepancies between predictions of the main isotopic species and the ALMA
spectrum prompted us to revisit the rotational spectrum of this isotopolog. We
assigned 9711 new transitions of CH$_3^{13}$C(O)CH$_3$ and 63 new transitions
of $^{13}$CH$_3$C(O)CH$_3$ in the laboratory spectra. More than 1000 additional
lines were assigned for the main isotopic species. We modeled the ground state
data of all three isotopologs satisfactorily with the ERHAM program. We find
that models of the torsionally excited states $v _{12} = 1$ and $v _{17} = 1$
of CH$_3$C(O)CH$_3$ improve only marginally. No transition of
CH$_3^{13}$C(O)CH$_3$ is clearly detected toward the hot molecular core Sgr
B2(N2). However, we report a tentative detection of $^{13}$CH$_3$C(O)CH$_3$
with a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio of 27 that is consistent with the ratio
previously measured for alcohols in this source. Several dozens of transitions
of both torsional states of the main isotopolog are detected as well. Our
predictions of CH$_3^{13}$C(O)CH$_3$ and CH$_3$C(O)CH$_3$ are reliable into the
terahertz region. The spectrum of $^{13}$CH$_3$C(O)CH$_3$ should be revisited
in the laboratory with an enriched sample. Transitions pertaining to the
torsionally excited states $v _{12} = 1$ and $v _{17} = 1$ of CH$_3$C(O)CH$_3$
could be identified unambiguously in Sagittarius B2(N2).

Title:Awakening of the fast-spinning accreting Be/X-ray pulsar A0538-66,"
Abstract:  A0538-66 is a Be/X-ray binary (Be/XRB) hosting a 69 ms pulsar. It emitted
bright X-ray outbursts with peak luminosity up to $\sim 10^{39}$ erg/s during
the first years after its discovery in 1977. Since then, it was always seen in
quiescence or during outbursts with $L_x \lesssim 4 \times 10^{37}$ erg/s. In
2018 we carried out XMM-Newton observations of A0538-66 during three
consecutive orbits when the pulsar was close to periastron. In the first two
observations we discovered a remarkable variability, with flares of typical
durations between $\sim$2-50 s and peak luminosities up to $\sim 4\times
10^{38}$ erg/s (0.2-10 keV). Between the flares the luminosity was $\sim
2\times 10^{35}$ erg/s. The flares were absent in the third observation, during
which A0538-66 had a steady luminosity of $2\times 10^{34}$ erg/s. In all
observations, the X-ray spectra consist of a softer component, well described
by an absorbed power law with photon index $\Gamma_1\approx 2-4$ and
$N_H\approx 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, plus a harder power-law component
($\Gamma_2\approx 0-0.5$) dominating above $\sim$2 keV. The softer component
shows larger flux variations than the harder one, and a moderate hardening
correlated with the luminosity. The fast flaring activity seen in these
observations was never observed before in A0538-66, nor, to our best knowledge,
in other Be/XRBs. We explore the possibility that during our observations the
source was accreting in a regime of nearly spherically symmetric inflow. In
this case, an atmosphere can form around the neutron star magnetosphere and the
observed variability can be explained by transitions between the accretion and
supersonic propeller regimes.

theory. The non-linearity of the Poisson equation in GR and primordial
non-Gaussianity are consistently included. We show that the inclusion of
non-local primordial non-Gaussianity in addition to local non-Gaussianity is
important to show the absence of the modulation of small scale clustering by
the long-wavelength mode in the single field slow-roll inflation. We study the
bispectrum of the relativistic galaxy density in several gauges and identify
the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity and GR corrections.

Abstract:  We investigate the observational signatures of many-field inflation and

For a given prior we employ the central limit theorem and the horizon crossing

dependence on the prior choice for initial conditions that has not been seen in
previous studies. Our main focus is on quadratic inflation, for which the
initial conditions statistics decouple from those of the mass distribution,
while other monomials are also briefly discussed. We verify the validity of our
calculations by comparing to full numerical simulations with 100 fields using
the transport method.

Title:Signatures of diffuse interstellar gas in the Galaxy Evolution Explorer all sky survey,"
Abstract:  The all sky survey run by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX AIS) mapped
about 85% of the Galaxy at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths and detected the
diffuse UV background produced by the scattering of the radiation from OBA
stars by interstellar dust grains. Against this background, diffuse weak
structures are detected as well as the UV counterparts to nebulae and molecular
clouds. To make full profit of the survey, unsupervised and semi-supervised
procedures need to be implemented. The main objective of this work is to
implement and analyze the results of the method developed by us for the blind
detection of ISM features in the GALEX AIS . Most ISM features are detected at
very low signal levels (dark filaments, globules) against the already faint UV
background. We have defined an index, the UV background fluctuations index (or
UBF index), to identify areas of the sky where these fluctuations are detected.
The algorithm is applied to the images obtained in the FUV (1344 -1786
Angstroms) band since this is less polluted by stellar sources, facilitating
the automated detection. The UBF index is shown to be sensitive to the main
star forming regions within the Gould's Belt, as well as to some prominent
loops like Loop I or the Eridanus and Monogem areas. The catalogue with the UBF
index values is made available on-line to the community.

Abstract:  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the next generation ground-based
observatory for $\gamma$-ray astronomy at energies above 30 GeV. Thanks to its
unique capabilities, CTA observations will address a plethora of open questions
in astrophysics ranging from the origin of cosmic messengers to the exploration
of the frontiers of physics. In this note, we present a comprehensive
sensitivity study to assess the potential of CTA to measure the $\gamma$-ray
absorption on the extragalactic background light (EBL), to constrain or detect
intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs), and probe physics beyond the Standard
Model such as axion-like particles (ALPs) and Lorentz invariance violation
(LIV), which could modify the $\gamma$-ray spectra features expected from EBL
absorption. Our results suggest that CTA will have unprecedented sensitivity to
detect IGMF signatures and will probe so-far unexplored regions of the LIV and
ALP parameter space. Furthermore, an indirect measurement of the EBL and of its
evolution will be performed with unrivaled precision.

Title:The multiplicity distribution of Kepler's exoplanets,"
Abstract:  The true multiplicity distribution of transiting planet systems is obscured
by strong observational biases, leading low-multiplicity systems to be
overrepresented in the observed sample. Using the Kepler FGK planet hosts, we
employ approximate Bayesian computation to infer the multiplicity distribution
by comparing simulated catalogs to the observed one. After comparing a total of
ten different multiplicity distributions, half of which were two-population
models, to the observed data, we find that a single-population model following
a Zipfian distribution is able to explain the Kepler data as well as any of the
dichotomous models we test. Our work provides another example of a way to
explain the observed Kepler multiplicities without invoking a dichotomous
planet population. Using our preferred Zipfian model, we estimate that an
additional $2393_{-717}^{+904}$ planets likely reside in the 1537 FGK Kepler
systems studied in this work, which would increase the planet count by a factor
of $2.22_{-0.36}^{+0.46}$. Of these hidden worlds, $663_{-151}^{+158}$ are
expected to reside in ostensibly single-transiting-planet systems, meaning that
an additional planet(s) is expected for approximately 1-in-2 such Kepler
systems.

Abstract:  The equilibrium of incompressible spheroid-ring systems in rigid rotation is

Title:Stellar and Dust Properties of a Complete Sample of Massive Dusty Galaxies at $1 \le z \le 4$ from MAGPHYS Modeling of UltraVISTA DR3 and Herschel Photometry,"
Abstract:  We investigate the stellar and dust properties of massive (log$(M_*/M_\odot)
\ge 10.5$) and dusty ($A_V \ge 1$) galaxies at $1 \le z \le 4$ by modeling
their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) obtained from the combination of
UltraVISTA DR3 photometry and \textit{Herschel} PACS-SPIRE data using MAGPHYS.
Although the rest-frame U-V vs V-J (UVJ) diagram traces well the star-formation
rates (SFR) and dust obscuration (A$_V$) out to $z \sim 3$, $\sim$15-20\% of
the sample surprisingly resides in the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram,
while $\sim50$\% at $3<z<4$ fall in the unobscured star-forming region. The
median SED of massive dusty galaxies exhibits weaker MIR and UV emission, and
redder UV slopes with increasing cosmic time. The IR emission for our sample
has a significant contribution ($>20\%$) from dust heated by evolved stellar
populations rather than star formation, demonstrating the need for panchromatic
SED modeling. The local relation between dust mass and SFR is followed only by
a sub-sample with cooler dust temperatures, while warmer objects have reduced
dust masses at a given SFR. Most star-forming galaxies in our sample do not
follow local IRX-$\beta$ relations, though IRX does strongly correlate with
A$_V$. Our sample follows local relations, albeit with large scatter, between
ISM diagnostics and sSFR. We show that FIR-detected sources represent the
extreme of a continuous population of dusty galaxies rather than a
fundamentally different population. Finally, using commonly adopted relations
to derive SFRs from the combination of the rest-frame UV and the observed
24$\mu$m is found to overestimate the SFR by a factor of 3-5 for the galaxies
in our sample.

Title:Geochemistry constrains global hydrology on Early Mars,"
Abstract:  Ancient hydrology is recorded by sedimentary rocks on Mars. The most
voluminous sedimentary rocks that formed during Mars' Hesperian period are
sulfate-rich rocks, explored by the $Opportunity$ rover from 2004-2012 and soon
to be investigated by the $Curiosity$ rover at Gale crater. A leading
hypothesis for the origin of these sulfates is that the cations were derived
from evaporation of deep-sourced groundwater, as part of a global circulation
of groundwater. Global groundwater circulation would imply sustained warm
Earthlike conditions on Early Mars. Global circulation of groundwater including
infiltration of water initially in equilibrium with Mars' CO$_2$ atmosphere
implies subsurface formation of carbonate. We find that the CO$_2$
sequestration implied by the global groundwater hypothesis for the origin of
sulfate-rich rocks on Mars is 30-5000 bars if the $Opportunity$ data are
representative of Hesperian sulfate-rich rocks, which is so large that (even
accounting for volcanic outgassing) it would bury the atmosphere. This
disfavors the hypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were
derived from upwelling of deep sourced groundwater. If, instead, Hesperian
sulfate-rich rocks are approximated as pure Mg-sulfate (no Fe), then the CO$_2$
sequestration is 0.3-400 bars. The low end of this range is consistent with the
hypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were derived from
upwelling of deep sourced groundwater. In both cases, carbon sequestration by
global groundwater circulation actively works to terminate surface
habitability, rather than being a passive marker of warm Earthlike conditions.
$Curiosity$ will soon be in a position to discriminate between these two
hypotheses. Our work links Mars sulfate cation composition, carbon isotopes,
and climate change.

Title:Formation of quasi-periodic slow magnetoacoustic wave trains by the heating/cooling misbalance,"
Abstract:  Slow magnetoacoustic waves are omnipresent in both natural and laboratory
plasma systems. The wave-induced misbalance between plasma cooling and heating
processes causes the amplification or attenuation, and also dispersion, of slow
magnetoacoustic waves. The wave dispersion could be attributed to the presence
of characteristic time scales in the system, connected with the plasma heating
or cooling due to the competition of the heating and cooling processes in the
vicinity of the thermal equilibrium. We analysed linear slow magnetoacoustic
waves in a plasma in a thermal equilibrium formed by a balance of optically
thin radiative losses, field-align thermal conduction, and an unspecified
heating. The dispersion is manifested by the dependence of the effective
adiabatic index of the wave on the wave frequency, making the phase and group
speeds frequency-dependent. The mutual effect of the wave amplification and
dispersion is shown to result into the occurrence of an oscillatory pattern in
an initially broadband slow wave, with the characteristic period determined by
the thermal misbalance time scales, i.e. by the derivatives of the combined
radiation loss and heating function with respect to the density and
temperature, evaluated at the equilibrium. This effect is illustrated by
estimating the characteristic period of the oscillatory pattern, appearing
because of thermal misbalance in the plasma of the solar corona. It is found
that by an order of magnitude the period is about the typical periods of slow
magnetoacoustic oscillations detected in the corona.

Title:Parametric study of polar configurations around binaries,"
Abstract:  Dynamical studies suggest that most of the circumbinary discs (CBDs) should
be coplanar. However, under certain initial conditions, the CBD can evolve
toward polar orientation. Here we extend the parametric study of polar
configurations around detached close-in binaries through $N$-body simulations.
For polar configurations around binaries with mass ratios $q$ below $0.7$, the
nominal location of the mean motion resonance (MMR) $1~:~4$ predicts the limit
of stability for $e_{B} > 0.1$. Alternatively, for $e_{B} < 0.1$ or $q \sim 1$,
the nominal location of the MMR $1~:~3$ is the closest stable region. The
presence of a} giant planet increases the region of forbidden polar
configurations around low mass ratio binaries with eccentricities $e_B\sim0.4$
with respect to rocky earth-like planets. For equal mass stars, the
eccentricity excitation $\Delta e$ of polar orbits smoothly increases with
decreasing distance to the binary. For $q<1$, $\Delta e$ can reach values as
high as $0.4$. Finally, we studied polar configurations around $HD~98800BaBb$
and show that the region of stability is strongly affected by the relative
positions of the nodes. The most stable configurations in the system correspond
to polar particles, which are not expected to survive on longer time-scales due
to the presence of the external perturber HD~$98800AaAb$.

relativistic dynamics, we find the physical tidal radius for complete
disruption $\cal{R}_t$ for a $10^6M_\odot$ black hole (BH). We find that across
a factor $\sim20$ in stellar mass $M_*$, i.e., $0.15M_{\odot}\leq
M_*\leq3M_\odot$, $\cal{R}_t\sim27\times$(BH's gravitational radius). When
comparing $\cal{R}_t$ with the commonly used order-of-magnitude estimate $r_t$,
we find that $\cal{R}_t\sim1.05-1.45r_t$ for $0.15M_\odot\leq
M_*\leq0.5M_\odot$, but between $0.5 M_\odot$ and $1 M_\odot$, $\cal{R}_t$
drops to $\sim 0.45r_t$, and it remains at this value up to $10 M_\odot$. The
near-constancy of $\cal{R}_t$ implies a weaker dependence of the full
disruption rate on $M_*$ than when predicted with $r_t$. The characteristic
energy width of the debris $\Delta E$ ranges from $\sim1.2\Delta\cal{E}$ for
low-mass stars to $\sim 0.35\Delta\cal{E}$ for higher-mass stars, where
$\Delta\cal{E}=GM_{\rm BH}R_*/\cal{R}_t^{2}$. We present analytic fits for the
$M_*$ dependence of $\cal{R}_t$ and $\Delta E$; these fits lead to analytic
expressions for the time of peak mass fallback rate and the maximal mass
fallback rate. Our results also bear on the fraction of events leading to fast
or slow circularization, as well as on the character of the tidal event
occurring when the remnant of a partial disruption returns to the black hole.
Using a semi-analytic model, we show that $\cal{R}_t$ is primarily determined
by the star's central density rather than its mean density. For high-mass
stars, the full disruption rate is roughly 1/4 the partial disruption rate,
while this ratio is close to unity for low-mass stars.

Title:What is wrong with steady accretion discs?,"
Abstract:  In a standard, steady, thin accretion disc, the radial distribution of the
dissipation of the accretion energy is determined simply by energy
considerations. Here we draw attention to the fact that while the
(quasi-)steady discs in dwarf novae in outburst are in agreement with the
expected emission distribution, the steady discs in the nova-like variables are
not. We note that essentially the only difference between these two sets of
discs is the time for which they have been in the high viscosity, high
accretion rate state. In such discs, the major process by which angular
momentum is transported outwards is MHD turbulence. We speculate that such
turbulence gives rise to corona-like structures (here called magnetically
controlled zones, or MCZs) which are also able to provide non-negligible
angular momentum transport, the magnitude of which depends on the spatial scale
$L$ of the magnetic field structures in such zones. For short-lived, high
accretion rate discs (such as those in dwarf novae) we expect $L \sim H$ and
the MCZ to have little effect. But, with time (such as in the nova-like
variables) an inverse cascade in the MHD turbulence enables $L$, and the net
effect of the MCZ, to grow. We present a simple toy model which demonstrates
that such ideas can provide an explanation for the difference between the dwarf
novae and the nova-like variable discs.

Title:Data Analysis for Precision 21 cm Cosmology,"
Abstract:  The redshifted 21 cm line is an emerging tool in cosmology, in principle
permitting three-dimensional surveys of our Universe that reach unprecedentedly
large volumes, previously inaccessible length scales, and hitherto unexplored
epochs of our cosmic timeline. Large radio telescopes have been constructed for
this purpose, and in recent years there has been considerable progress in
transforming 21 cm cosmology from a field of considerable theoretical promise
to one of observational reality. Increasingly, practitioners in the field are
coming to the realization that the success of observational 21cm cosmology will
hinge on software algorithms and analysis pipelines just as much as it does on
careful hardware design and telescope construction. This review provides a
pedagogical introduction to state-of-the-art ideas in 21 cm data analysis,
covering a wide variety of steps in a typical analysis pipeline, from
calibration to foreground subtraction to mapmaking to power spectrum estimation
to parameter estimation.

Title:A Catalog of Hyper-luminous X-ray Sources and Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Candidates out to High Redshifts,"
Abstract:  Hyper-luminous X-ray sources (HLXs; L_X>10^41 erg s^-1) are off-nuclear X-ray
sources in galaxies and strong candidates for intermediate-mass black holes
(IMBHs). We have constructed a sample of 169 HLX candidates by combining X-ray
detections from the Chandra Source Catalog (Version 2) with galaxies from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey and registering individual images for improved
relative astrometric accuracy. The spatial resolution of Chandra allows for the
sample to extend out to z~0.9. Optical counterparts are detected among
one-fourth of the sample, one-third of which are consistent with dwarf galaxy
stellar masses. The average intrinsic X-ray spectral slope indicates efficient
accretion, potentially driven by galaxy mergers, and the column densities
suggest one-third of the sample has significant X-ray absorption. We find that
144 of the HLX candidates have X-ray emission that is significantly in excess
of the expected contribution from star formation and hot gas, strongly
suggesting that they are produced by accretion onto black holes more massive
than stars. After correcting for an average background or foreground
contamination rate of 8%, we estimate that at least ~20 of the HLX candidates
are consistent with IMBH masses, and this estimate is potentially several times
higher assuming more efficient accretion. This catalog currently represents the
largest sample of uniformly-selected, off-nuclear IMBH candidates. These
sources may represent scenarios in which a low-mass galaxy hosting an IMBH has
merged with a more massive galaxy and provide an excellent sample for testing
models of low-mass BH formation and merger-driven growth.

Title:High sensitivity maps of molecular ions in L1544: I. Deuteration of N2H+ and HCO+ and first evidence of N2D+ depletion,"
Abstract:  Context. The deuterium fraction in low-mass prestellar cores is a good
diagnostic indicator of the initial phases of star formations, and it is also a
fundamental quantity to infer the ionisation degree in these objects.
Aims. With the analysis of multiple transitions of $\rm N_2H^+$, $\rm
N_2D^+$, $\rm HC^{18}O^+$ and $\rm DCO^+$ we are able to determine the
molecular column density maps and the deuterium fraction in $\rm N_2H^+$ and
$\rm HCO^+$ toward the prototypical prestellar core L1544. This is the
preliminary step to derive the ionisation degree in the source.
Methods. We use a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative
transfer code, combined with the molecular abundances derived from a chemical
model, to infer the excitation conditions of all the observed transitions,
which allows us to derive reliable maps of each molecule's column density. The
ratio between the column density of a deuterated species and its non-deuterated
counterpart gives the searched deuteration level.
Results. The non-LTE analysis confirms that, for the analysed molecules,
higher-J transitions are characterised by excitation temperatures $\approx
1-2\,$K lower than the lower-J ones. The chemical model that provides the best
fit to the observational data predict the depletion of $\rm N_2H^+$ and to a
lesser extent of $\rm N_2D^+$ in the innermost region. The peak values for the
deuterium fraction that we find are $\mathrm{D/H_{N_2H^+}} =
0.26^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$ and $\mathrm{D/H_{HCO^+}} = 0.035^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, in
good agreement with previous estimates in the source.

Title:Physics of relativistic collisionless shocks: II Dynamics of the background plasma,"
Abstract:  In this second paper of a series, we discuss the dynamics of a plasma
entering the precursor of an unmagnetized, relativistic collisionless pair
shock. We discuss how this background plasma is decelerated and heated through
its interaction with a microturbulence that results from the growth of a
current filamentation instability (CFI) in the shock precursor. We make use, in
particular, of the reference frame $\mathcal R_{\rm w}$ in which the turbulence
is mostly magnetic. This frame moves at relativistic velocities towards the
shock front at rest, decelerating gradually from the far to the near precursor.
In a first part, we construct a fluid model to derive the deceleration law of
the background plasma expected from the scattering of suprathermal particles
off the microturbulence. This law leads to the relationship $\gamma_{\rm
p}\,\sim\,\xi_{\rm b}^{-1/2}$ between the background plasma Lorentz factor
$\gamma_{\rm p}$ and the normalized pressure of the beam $\xi_{\rm b}$; it is
found to match nicely the spatial profiles observed in large-scale 2D3V
particle-in-cell simulations. In a second part, we model the dynamics of the
background plasma at the kinetic level, incorporating the inertial effects
associated with the deceleration of $\mathcal R_{\rm w}$ into a
Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation for pitch-angle diffusion. We show how the
effective gravity in $\mathcal R_{\rm w}$ drives the background plasma
particles through friction on the microturbulence, leading to efficient plasma
heating. Finally, we compare a Monte Carlo simulation of our model with
dedicated PIC simulations and conclude that it can satisfactorily reproduce
both the heating and the deceleration of the background plasma in the shock
precursor, thereby providing a successful 1D description of the shock
transition at the microscopic level.

Title:Four Small Planets Buried in K2 Systems: What Can We Learn for TESS?,"
Abstract:  The Kepler, K2, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) missions
have provided a wealth of confirmed exoplanets, benefiting from a huge effort
from the planet-hunting and follow-up community. With careful systematics
mitigation, these missions provide precise photometric time series, which
enable detection of transiting exoplanet signals. However, exoplanet hunting
can be confounded by several factors, including instrumental noise, search
biases, and host star variability. In this Letter, we discuss strategies to
overcome these challenges using newly emerging techniques and tools. We
demonstrate the power of new, fast open-source community tools (e.g.,
lightkurve, starry, celerite, exoplanet), and discuss four high signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) exoplanets that showcase specific challenges present in planet
detection: K2-43c, K2-168c, K2-198c, and K2-198d. These planets have been
undetected in several large K2 planet searches, despite having transit signals
with S/N > 10. Two of the planets discussed here are new discoveries. In this
work we confirm all four as true planets. Alongside these planet systems, we
discuss three key challenges in finding small transiting exoplanets. The aim of
this Letter is to help new researchers understand where planet detection
efficiency gains can be made, and to encourage the continued use of K2 archive
data. The considerations presented in this Letter are equally applicable to
Kepler, K2, and TESS, and the tools discussed here are available for the
community to apply to improve exoplanet discovery and fitting.

Title:Neutral hydrogen gas within and around NGC 1316,"
Abstract:  We present MeerKAT observations of neutral hydrogen gas (HI) in the nearby
merger remnant NGC 1316 (Fornax A), the brightest member of a galaxy group
which is falling into the Fornax cluster. We find HI on a variety of scales,
from the galaxy centre to its large-scale environment. For the first time we
detect HI at large radii (70 - 150 kpc in projection), mostly distributed on
two long tails associated with the galaxy. Gas in the tails dominates the HI
mass of NGC 1316: 7e+8 Msun -- 14 times more than in previous observations. The
total HI mass is comparable to the amount of neutral gas found inside the
stellar body, mostly in molecular form. The HI tails are associated with faint
optical tidal features thought to be the remnant of a galaxy merger occurred a
few billion years ago. They demonstrate that the merger was gas-rich. During
the merger, tidal forces pulled some gas and stars out to large radii, where we
now detect them in the form of optical tails and, thanks to our new data, HI
tails; while torques caused the remaining gas to flow towards the centre of the
remnant, where it was converted into molecular gas and fuelled the starburst
revealed by the galaxy's stellar populations. Several of the observed
properties of NGC 1316 can be reproduced by a ~ 10:1 merger between a dominant,
gas-poor early-type galaxy and a smaller, gas-rich spiral occurred 1 - 3 Gyr
ago, likely followed by subsequent accretion of satellite galaxies.

Title:Q-type asteroids: Possibility of non-fresh weathered surfaces,"
Abstract:  Itokawa particles, which are the recovered samples from the S-complex
asteroid 25143 Itokawa by the Hayabusa spacecraft, demonstrate that S-complex
asteroids are parent bodies of ordinary chondrite meteorites. Furthermore, they
clarify that the space weathering age of the Itokawa surface is of the order of
several thousand years. Traditionally, Q-type asteroids have been considered
fresh-surfaced. However, as the space weathering timescale is approximately
three orders of magnitude lesser than the conventionally considered age, the
previously proposed formation mechanisms of Q-type asteroids cannot
sufficiently explain the surface refreshening. In this study, we propose a new
hypothesis on the surface state of Q-type asteroids: Q-type asteroids have a
non-fresh weathered surface with a paucity of fine particles. For verifying
this hypothesis, laboratory experiments on the space weathering of ordinary
chondrites are performed. Based on the results of these experiments, we found
that large (more than 100 {\mu}m) ordinary chondritic particles with space
weathering exhibit spectra consistent with Q-type asteroids.

Title:Transit timing variations in the WASP-4 planetary system,"
Abstract:  Transits in the planetary system WASP-4 were recently found to occur 80s
earlier than expected in observations from the TESS satellite. We present 22
new times of mid-transit that confirm the existence of transit timing
variations, and are well fitted by a quadratic ephemeris with period decay
dP/dt = -9.2 +/- 1.1 ms/yr. We rule out instrumental issues, stellar activity
and the Applegate mechanism as possible causes. The light-time effect is also
not favoured due to the non-detection of changes in the systemic velocity.
Orbital decay and apsidal precession are plausible but unproven. WASP-4b is
only the third hot Jupiter known to show transit timing variations to high
confidence. We discuss a variety of observations of this and other planetary
systems that would be useful in improving our understanding of WASP-4 in
particular and orbital decay in general.

measurements of terrestrial exoplanets in the Habitable Zone of Sun-like stars.
At the same time, this experiment will serve as the technical pathfinder and
facility core for a second-phase larger facility at the Medium scale, which can
provide a significant detection of cosmological redshift drift on a 6-year

equipment (telescopes, CCD cameras, and control computers) combined with a
novel optical architecture to produce telescope collecting areas equivalent to
standard telescopes with large mirror diameters. Combining a PolyOculus array

Title:Astro2020 Project White Paper: PolyOculus -- Low-cost Spectroscopy for the Community,"
Abstract:  As astronomy moves into the era of large-scale time-domain surveys, we are
seeing a flood of new transient and variable sources which will reach biblical
proportions with the advent of LSST. A key strategic challenge for astronomy in
this era is the lack of suitable spectroscopic followup facilities. In response
to this need, we have developed the PolyOculus approach for producing
large-area-equivalent telescopes by using fiber optics to link modules of
multiple semi-autonomous, small, inexpensive, commercial-off-the-shelf
telescopes. Crucially, this scalable design has construction costs which are
$>10x$ lower than equivalent traditional large-area telescopes. In addition,
PolyOculus is inherently highly automated and well-suited for remote
operations. Development of this technology will enable the expansion of major
research efforts in the LSST era to a host of smaller universities and
colleges, including primarily-undergraduate institutions, for budgets
consistent with their educational expenditures on similar facilities. We
propose to develop and deploy a 1.6-m prototype demonstrator at the Mt. Laguna
Observatory in California, followed by a full-scale 5-meter-class PolyOculus
facility for linkage to existing and upcoming time-domain surveys.

90 postdocs.
The SO experiment in its currently funded form ('SO-Nominal') consists of
three 0.4 m Small Aperture Telescopes (SATs) and one 6 m Large Aperture
Telescope (LAT). Optimized for minimizing systematic errors in polarization
measurements at large angular scales, the SATs will perform a deep,
degree-scale survey of 10% of the sky to search for the signature of primordial
gravitational waves. The LAT will survey 40% of the sky with arc-minute
resolution. These observations will measure (or limit) the sum of neutrino
masses, search for light relics, measure the early behavior of Dark Energy, and
refine our understanding of the intergalactic medium, clusters and the role of
feedback in galaxy formation.
With up to ten times the sensitivity and five times the angular resolution of
the Planck satellite, and roughly an order of magnitude increase in mapping
speed over currently operating (""Stage 3"") experiments, SO will measure the CMB
temperature and polarization fluctuations to exquisite precision in six

Abstract:  Spectra that cover wavelengths from 0.6 to 1.1um are used to examine the
behavior of emission and absorption features in a contiguous 22 x 300 arcsec
region centered on the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 55. Based on the relative
strengths of various emission features measured over spatial scales of many
tens of parsecs, it is concluded that the ionization states and sulphur
abundances in most of the star-forming regions near the center of NGC 55 are
similar. A large star-forming region is identified in the north west part of
the disk at a projected distance of ~1 kpc from the galaxy center that has
distinct ionization properties. Fossil star-forming regions are also identified
using the depth of the near-infrared Ca triplet. One such area is identified
near the intersection of the major and minor axes, and it is suggested that
this area is a proto-nucleus. The spectra of bright unresolved sources that are
blended stellar asterisms, compact HII regions, and star clusters are also
discussed. The spectra of some of the HII regions contain Ca triplet absorption
lines, signalling a concentration of stars in the resolution element that span
many Myr. Six of the unresolved sources have spectroscopic characteristics that
are indicative of C stars embedded in intermediate age clusters. The peculiar
properties of NGC 55 have been well documented in the literature, and it is
argued that these may indicate that NGC 55 is transforming into a dwarf
lenticular galaxy.

Title:Double neutron star mergers from hierarchical triple-star systems,"
Abstract:  The isolated binary evolution model for merging neutron stars (NSs) involves
processes such as mass transfer, common-envelope evolution, and natal kicks,
all of which are poorly understood. Also, the predicted NS-NS merger rates are
typically lower than the rates inferred from the LIGO GW170817 event. Here, we
investigate merger rates of NS and black hole (BH)-NS binaries in hierarchical
triple-star systems. In such systems, the tertiary can induce Lidov-Kozai (LK)
oscillations in the inner binary, accelerating its coalescence, and potentially
enhancing compact object merger rates. However, since compact objects originate
from massive stars, the prior evolution should also be taken into account.
Natal kicks, in particular, could significantly reduce the rates by unbinding
the tertiary before it can affect the inner binary through LK evolution. We
carry out simulations of massive triples taking into account stellar evolution
starting from the main sequence, secular and tidal evolution, and the effects
of supernovae. For large NS birth kicks (\sigma_k = 265 km/s), we find that the
triple NS-NS merger rate (several hundred Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}) is lower by a
factor of ~2-3 than the binary rate, but for no kicks (\sigma_k = 0 km/s), the
triple rate (several thousand Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}) is comparable to the binary
rate. Our results indicate that a significant fraction of NS-NS mergers could
originate from triples if a substantial portion of the NS population is born
with low kick velocities, as indicated by other work. However, uncertainties
and open questions remain because of our simplifying assumption of dynamical
decoupling after inner binary interaction has been triggered.

Abstract:  In this work, we propose two convolutional neural network classifiers for

are able to identify various contaminants, such as cosmic rays, hot and bad
pixels, persistence effects, satellite or plane trails, residual fringe
patterns, nebulous features, saturated pixels, diffraction spikes, and tracking
errors in images. They encompass a broad range of ambient conditions, such as
seeing, image sampling, detector type, optics, and stellar density. The first
classifier, MaxiM ask , performs semantic segmentation and generates bad pixel
maps for each contaminant, based on the probability that each pixel belongs to
a given contaminant class. The second classifier, MaxiTrack , classifies entire
images and mosaics, by computing the probability for the focal plane to be
affected by tracking errors. We gathered training and testing data from real
data originating from various modern charged-coupled devices and near-infrared
cameras, that are augmented with image simulations. We quantified the
performance of both classifiers and show that M axi M ask achieves
state-of-the-art performance for the identification of cosmic ray hits. Thanks
to a built-in Bayesian update mechanism, both classifiers can be tuned to meet
specific science goals in various observational contexts.

Title:Thermal evolution and quiescent emission of transiently accreting neutron stars,"
Abstract:  We study long-term thermal evolution of neutron stars in soft X-ray
transients (SXTs), taking the deep crustal heating into account consistently
with the changes of the composition of the crust. We collect observational
estimates of average accretion rates and thermal luminosities of such neutron
stars and compare the theory with observations. We perform simulations of
thermal evolution of accreting neutron stars, considering the gradual
replacement of the original nonaccreted crust by the reprocessed accreted
matter, the neutrino and photon energy losses, and the deep crustal heating due
to nuclear reactions in the accreted crust. We test and compare results for
different modern theoretical models. We update a compilation of the
observational estimates of the thermal luminosities in quiescence and average
accretion rates in the SXTs and compare the observational estimates with the
theoretical results. Long-term thermal evolution of transiently accreting
neutron stars is nonmonotonic. The quasi-equilibrium temperature in quiescence
reaches a minimum and then increases toward the final steady state. The
quasi-equilibrium thermal luminosity of a neutron star in an SXT can be
substantially lower at the minimum than in the final state. This enlarges the
range of possibilities for theoretical interpretation of observations of such
neutron stars. The updates of the theory and observations leave unchanged the
previous conclusions that the direct Urca process operates in relatively cold
neutron stars and that an accreted heat-blanketing envelope is likely present
in relatively hot neutron stars in the SXTs in quiescence. The results of the
comparison of theory with observations favor suppression of the triplet pairing
type of nucleon superfluidity in the neutron-star matter.

Abstract:  We present ALMA observations at 233, 678, and 870 GHz of the Galactic Center
black hole, Sagittarius A*. These observations reveal a flat spectrum over this
frequency range with spectral index $\alpha \approx -0.3$, where the flux
density $S \propto \nu^\alpha$. We model the submm and far infrared spectrum
with a one zone synchrotron model of thermal electrons. We infer electron
densities $n = (2-5) \times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$, electron temperatures $T_e = (1-3)
\times 10^{11}$ K, and magnetic field strength $B = 10-50$ G. The parameter
range can be further constrained using the observed quiescent X-ray luminosity.
The flat submm spectrum results in a high electron temperature and implies that
the emitting electrons are efficiently heated. We also find that the emission
is most likely optically thin at 233 GHz. These results indicate that
millimeter and submillimeter wavelength very long baseline interferometry of
Sgr A* including those of the Event Horizon Telescope should see a transparent
emission region down to event horizon scales.

Title:The Luminosity Function and Formation Rate of A Complete Sample of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts,"
Abstract:  We study the luminosity function and formation rate of long gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) by using a maximum likelihood method. This is the first time this method
is applied to a well-defined sample of GRBs that is complete in redshift. The
sample is composed of 99 bursts detected by the $Swift$ satellite, 81 of them
with measured redshift and luminosity for a completeness level of $82\%$. We
confirm that a strong redshift evolution in luminosity (with an evolution index
of $\delta=2.22^{+0.32}_{-0.31}$) or in density ($\delta=1.92^{+0.20}_{-0.21}$)
is needed in order to reproduce the observations well. But since the predicted
redshift and luminosity distributions in the two scenarios are very similar, it
is difficult to distinguish between these two kinds of evolutions only on the
basis of the current sample. Furthermore, we also consider an empirical density
case in which the GRB rate density is directly described as a broken power-law
function and the luminosity function is taken to be non-evolving. In this case,
we find that the GRB formation rate rises like $(1+z)^{3.85^{+0.48}_{-0.45}}$
for $z\leq2$ and is proportional to $(1+z)^{-1.07^{+0.98}_{-1.12}}$ for
$z\geq2$. The local GRB rate is $1.49^{+0.63}_{-0.64}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$.
The GRB rate may be consistent with the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) at
$z\leq2$, but shows an enhancement compared to the SFR at $z\geq2$.

Abstract:  No transient electromagnetic emission has yet been found in association to
fast radio bursts (FRBs), the only possible exception (3sigma confidence) being
the putative gamma-ray signal detected in Swift/BAT data in the energy band
15-150 keV at the time and position of FRB131104. Systematic searches for hard
X/gamma-ray counterparts to other FRBs ended up with just lower limits on the
radio/gamma-ray fluence ratios. In 2001, at the time of the earliest discovered
FRBs, the BeppoSAX Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) was one of the most sensitive
open sky gamma-ray monitors in the 40-700~keV energy band. During its lifetime,
one of the FRBs with the highest radio fluence ever recorded, FRB010724 (800 +-

Upon an accurate modeling of the GRBM background, eased by its equatorial
orbit, we searched for a possible gamma-ray signal in the first 400 s following

Title:Refractive Interstellar Scintillation of Extra-galactic Radio Sources I: Expectations,"
Abstract:  Surveys for transient and variable phenomena can be confounded by the
presence of extrinsic variability such as refractive interstellar scintillation
(RISS). We have developed an all-sky model for RISS which can predict
variability on a variety of timescales, survey locations, and observing
frequencies. The model makes use of Halpha intensity maps to probe the emission
measure along the line of sight, convert this to a scattering measure, and
finally a scintillation strength. The model uses previously developed and long
understood physics along with (indirect) measurements of the electron content
and distribution within the Milky Way. We develop a set of expectations that
are useful in the planning of future surveys for transient and radio
variability, and demonstrate that the 1-GHz sky is a poor predictor of the
variable nature of the $100$-MHz sky. Interestingly, the correlation between
the incidence of variability and Galactic latitude which has been seen at 1GHz,
is reversed at 100MHz. We compare the predictions of our model to a
low-frequency radio survey that was conducted with the Murchison Widefield
Array, and find good qualitative agreement. We discuss the implications,
current limitations, and future development of the model. The model has been
implemented in a Python code and is available on GitHub/Zenodo.

Title:Cloud G074.11+00.11: a stellar cluster in formation,"
Abstract:  We present molecular line and dust continuum observations of a
Planck-detected cold cloud, G074.11+00.11. The cloud consists of a system of
curved filaments and a central star-forming clump. The clump is associated with
several infrared sources and H2O maser emission. We aim to determine the mass
distribution and gas dynamics within the clump, to investigate if the
filamentary structure seen around the clump repeats itself on a smaller scale,
and to estimate the fractions of mass contained in dense cores and filaments.
The velocity distribution of pristine dense gas can be used to investigate the
global dynamical state of the clump, the role of filamentary inflows, filament
fragmentation and core accretion. We use molecular line and continuum
observations from single dish observatories and interferometric facilities to
study the kinematics of the region. The molecular line observations show that
the central clump may have formed as a result of a large-scale filament
collision. The central clump contains three compact cores. Assuming a distance
of 2.3 kpc, based on Gaia observations and a three-dimensional extinction
method of background stars, the mass of the central clump exceeds 700 solar
masses, which is roughly 25% of the total mass of the cloud. Our virial
analysis suggests that the central clump and all identified substructures are
collapsing. We find no evidence for small-scale filaments associated with the
cores. Our observations indicate that the clump is fragmented into three cores
with masses in the range [10,50] solar masses and that all three are
collapsing. The presence of an H2O maser emission suggests active star
formation. However, the CO lines show only weak signs of outflows. We suggest
that the region is young and any processes leading to star formation have just
recently begun.

Title:Status of the Davies-Cotton and Schwarzschild-Couder Medium-Sized Telescopes for the Cherenkov Telescope Array,"
Abstract:  The Cherenkov Telescope Array is an observatory dedicated to very high energy
gamma rays with unprecedented sensitivity between 20 GeV and 300 TeV to be
installed on two sites: Canary Island La Palma and Paranal Chile. Three
telescope sizes will be used to cover the entire energy range. Two different
telescope designs have been proposed to cover the intermediate energy range
from 150 GeV to 5 TeV. One of the proposals is based on the traditional single
mirror Davies-Cotton design, with two different camera concepts with different
detection and processing schemes are under test. Another innovative design
based on a dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder optics has also been developed and
is under test in Arizona, USA. In this talk, the different concepts and the
status of the prototypes will be presented.

Title:The Eclipsing Accreting White Dwarf Z Chameleontis as Seen with TESS,"
Abstract:  We present results from a study of TESS observations of the eclipsing dwarf
nova system Z Cha, covering both an outburst and a superoutburst. We discover
that Z Cha undergoes hysteretic loops in eclipse depth - out-of-eclipse flux
space in both the outburst and the superoutburst. The direction that these
loops are executed in indicates that the disk size increases during an outburst
before the mass transfer rate through the disk increases, placing constraints
on the physics behind the triggering of outbursts and superoutbursts. By
fitting the signature of the superhump period in a flux-phase diagram, we find
the rate at which this period decreases in this system during a superoutburst
for the first time. We find that the superhumps in this source skip
evolutionary stage ""A"" seen during most dwarf nova superoutbursts, even though
this evolutionary stage has been seen during previous superoutbursts of the
same object. Finally, O-C values of eclipses in our sample are used to
calculate new ephemerides for the system, strengthening the case for a third
body in Z Cha and placing new constraints on its orbit.

Title:Effect of nucleation on icy pebble growth in protoplanetary discs,"
Abstract:  Solid particles in protoplanetary discs can grow by direct vapour deposition
outside of ice lines. The presence of microscopic silicate particles may
nevertheless hinder growth into large pebbles, since the available vapour is
deposited predominantly on the small grains that dominate the total surface
area. Experiments on heterogeneous ice nucleation, performed to understand ice
clouds in the Martian atmosphere, show that the formation of a new ice layer on
a silicate surface requires a substantially higher water vapour pressure than
the deposition of water vapour on an existing ice surface. In this paper, we
investigate how the difference in partial vapour pressure needed for deposition
of vapour on water ice versus heterogeneous ice nucleation on silicate grains
influences particle growth close to the water ice line. We developed and tested
a dynamical 1D deposition and sublimation model, where we include radial drift,
sedimentation, and diffusion in a turbulent protoplanetary disc. We find that
vapour is deposited predominantly on already ice-covered particles, since the
vapour pressure exterior of the ice line is too low for heterogeneous
nucleation on bare silicate grains. Icy particles can thus grow to
centimetre-sized pebbles in a narrow region around the ice line, whereas
silicate particles stay dust-sized and diffuse out over the disc. The
inhibition of heterogeneous ice nucleation results in a preferential region for
growth into planetesimals close to the ice line where we find large icy
pebbles. The suppression of heterogeneous ice nucleation on silicate grains may
also be the mechanism behind some of the observed dark rings around ice lines
in protoplanetary discs, as the presence of large ice pebbles outside ice lines
leads to a decrease in the opacity there.

Title:Trojans in the Solar Neighborhood,"
Abstract:  About 20% of stars in the solar vicinity are in the Hercules stream, a bundle
of stars that move together with a velocity distinct from the Sun. Its origin
is still uncertain. Here, we explore the possibility that Hercules is made of
trojans, stars captured at L4, one the Lagrangian points of the stellar bar.
Using GALAKOS--a high-resolution N-body simulation of the Galactic disk--we
follow the motions of stars in the co-rotating frame of the bar and confirm
previous studies on Hercules being formed by stars in co-rotation resonance
with the bar. Unlike previous work, we demonstrate that the retrograde nature
of trojan orbits causes the asymmetry in the radial velocity distribution,
typical of Hercules in the solar vicinity. We show that trojans remain at
capture for only a finite amount of time, before escaping L4 without being
captured again. We anticipate that in the kinematic plane the Hercules stream
will de-populate along the bar major axis and be visible at azimuthal angles
behind the solar vicinity with a peak towards L4. This test can exclude the OLR
origin of the Hercules stream and be validated by Gaia DR3 and DR4.

Title:Tidal disruption events as a site of an evolving relativistic spectral~line,"
Abstract:  In nuclei of galaxies strong tidal forces can destroy stars passing within a
critical distance from the central super-massive black hole (SMBH).
Observational signatures of tidal disruption events (TDEs) depend on the
environment around the SBMH horizon and the level of its accretion activity.
Evidence for optical and UV spectral features has been reported in TDE flares;
nevertheless, to test the effects of General Relativity in the immediate
vicinity of SMBH, the relativistically broadened and skewed X-ray line would
tell us significantly more useful information. This will require to proceed
beyond inactive nuclei. To this end we consider a system where the material
from a disrupted star forms a gaseous ring that circularises near the tidal
radius around SMBH, it gradually spreads in radius by viscous processes, and
resides embedded within a hot corona.
In our test calculation the remnant trail is assumed to be fully circularized
and embedded in a hot environment and illuminated by X-rays from a surrounding
corona or a jet base of (mild) AGN activity. We show the expected effects on
the observed profile and the centroid energy. In future the evolving spectral
features can enhance the diagnostic capability and provide a novel way to
reveal the parameters of TDEs in such sources; namely, the distance of the
remnant gas from the SMBH, the radial extent of the gaseous trail, and the spin
of the SMBH could be measured.

Title:Using Muon Rings for the Optical Throughput Calibration of the Cherenkov Telescope Array,"
Abstract:  Muon ring images observed with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
(IACTs) provide a powerful means to calibrate the optical throughput of IACTs
and monitor their optical point spread function. We investigate whether muons
ring images can be used as the primary optical throughput calibration method
for the telescopes of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and find
several additional systematic effects in comparison to previous works. To
ensure that the method achieves the accuracy required by CTA, these systematic
effects need to be taken into account and minor modifications to the hardware
and analysis are necessary. We derive analytic estimates for the expected muon
data rates to be used for optical throughput calibration, monitoring of the
optical point spread function, with achievable statistical and systematic
uncertainties, and explore the potential of muon ring images as a secondary
method of camera pixel flat-fielding.

"Title:Cosmological information content in redshift-space power spectrum of SDSS-like galaxies in the quasi-nonlinear regime up to $k=0.3\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$","
Abstract:  Clustering properties and peculiar velocities of halos in large-scale
structure carry a wealth of cosmological information over a wide range of
scales from linear to nonlinear scales. We use halo catalogs in a suite of
high-resolution $N$-body simulations to construct mock catalogs of galaxies
that resemble the SDSS-like luminous early-type galaxies at three redshift bins
in the range $0.15\le z\le 0.7$. To do this we include 10 nuisance parameters
to model variations in halo-galaxy connections for each redshift bin; the halo
occupation distribution, and the spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies
in the host halos. We evaluate the Fisher information matrix for the
redshift-space power spectrum of SDSS-like galaxies using different sets of the
mock catalogs that are generated from changes in each of model parameters;
cosmological parameters ($\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$), the halo-galaxy
connection parameters, and the cosmological distances ($D_{\rm A}$ and $H$
parameters at each redshift bin) for modeling an apparent geometrical
distortion of the redshift-space power spectrum (the Alcock-Paczynski effect).
We show that combining the monopole and quadrupole power spectra of galaxies
allows for accurate estimations of the cosmological parameters and the
cosmological distances, even after marginalization over the halo-galaxy
parameters, by lifting the parameter degeneracies that are otherwise inevitable
if either of the two spectra alone is used. When including the galaxy power
spectrum information up to $k=0.3\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$, we find about factor of 6
gain in the cosmological information content of ($\sigma_8,\Omega_{\rm
m},D_{\rm A}$'s and $H$'s) compared to $k=0.2\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$.

hundreds of times faster than previous TeV telescopes, and with a much deeper

of view of its synergies with other instruments and facilities, highlighting

Title:Numerical Methods for Simulating Star Formation,"
Abstract:  We review the numerical techniques for ideal and non-ideal
magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) used in the context of star formation simulations.
We outline the specific challenges offered by modeling star forming
environments, which are dominated by supersonic and super-Alfvenic turbulence
in a radiative, self-gravitating fluid. These conditions are rather unique in
physics and engineering and pose particularly severe restrictions on the
robustness and accuracy of numerical codes. One striking aspect is the
formation of collapsing fluid elements leading to the formation of
singularities that represent point-like objects, namely the proto-stars.
Although a few studies have attempted to resolve the formation of the first and
second Larson cores, resolution limitations force us to use sink particle
techniques, with sub-grid models to compute the accretion rates of mass,
momentum and energy, as well as their ejection rate due to radiation and jets
from the proto-stars. We discuss the most popular discretisation techniques
used in the community, namely smoothed particle hydrodynamics, finite
difference and finite volume methods, stressing the importance to maintain a
divergence-free magnetic field. We discuss how to estimate the truncation error
of a given numerical scheme, and its importance in setting the magnitude of the
numerical diffusion. This can have a strong impact on the outcome of these MHD
simulations, where both viscosity and resistivity are implemented at the grid
scale. We then present various numerical techniques to model non-ideal MHD
effects, such as Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion, as well as the Hall effect.
These important physical ingredients are posing strong challenges in term of
resolution and time stepping. For the latter, several strategies are discussed
to overcome the limitations due to prohibitively small time steps (abridged).

Title:The glow of annihilating dark matter in Omega Centauri,"
Abstract:  Dark matter (DM) is the most abundant material in the Universe, but has so
far been detected only via its gravitational effects. Several theories suggest
that pairs of DM particles can annihilate into a flash of light at gamma-ray
wavelengths. While gamma-ray emission has been observed from environments where
DM is expected to accumulate, such as the centre of our Galaxy, other high
energy sources can create a contaminating astrophysical gamma-ray background,
thus making DM detection difficult. In principle, dwarf galaxies around the
Milky Way are a better place to look -- they contain a greater fraction of DM
with no astrophysical gamma-ray background -- but they are too distant for
gamma-rays to have been seen. A range of observational evidence suggests that
Omega Centauri (omega Cen or NGC 5139), usually classified as the Milky Way's
largest globular cluster, is really the core of a captured and stripped dwarf
galaxy. Importantly, Omega Cen is ten times closer to us than known dwarfs.
Here we show that not only does Omega Cen contain DM with density as high as
compact dwarf galaxies, but also that it emits gamma-rays with an energy
spectrum matching that expected from the annihilation of DM particles with mass
31$\pm$4 GeV (68\% confidence limit). No astrophysical sources have been found
that would otherwise explain Omega Cen's gamma-ray emission, despite deep
multi-wavelength searches. We anticipate our results to be the starting point
for even deeper radio observations of Omega Cen. If multi-wavelength searches
continue to find no astrophysical explanations, this pristine, nearby clump of
DM will become the best place to study DM interactions through forces other
than gravity.

Title:Modeling the non-thermal emission of the gamma Cygni Supernova Remnant up to the highest energies,"
Abstract:  The gamma Cygni supernova remnant (SNR) is a middle-aged, Sedov-phase SNR in
the Cygnus region. It is a known source of non-thermal emission at radio,
X-ray, and gamma-ray energies. Very-high energy (VHE, >100 GeV) gamma-ray
emission from gamma Cygni was first detected by the VERITAS observatory and it
has since been observed by other experiments. Observations so far indicate that
there must be a population of non-thermal particles present in the remnant
which produces the observed emission. However, it is not clear what kind of
particles (protons/ions or electrons) are accelerated in the remnant, how
efficient the acceleration is, and up to which energy particles can be
accelerated. Accurate measurements of the VHE gamma-ray spectrum are crucial to
investigate particle acceleration above TeV energies. This presentation will
focus on multi-wavelength observations of the gamma Cygni SNR and their
interpretation. We will present improved measurements of the VHE gamma-ray
emission spectrum of gamma Cygni by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)
gamma-ray observatory, and use these results as well as measurements from other
instruments to model the underlying particle populations producing this

extend spectral measurements to higher energies and better constrain the
maximum acceleration energy.

Title:A Survey of TeV emission from Galactic Supernova Remnants with HAWC,"
Abstract:  Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been hypothesized as the main source of
Galactic Cosmic Rays up to PeV energies. Some of them have indeed been shown to
accelerate protons to TeV energies and above. But which of them are indeed
efficient accelerators of protons and nuclei? And up to which energies can they
accelerate these particles? Measurements of non-thermal emission, especially in
the X-ray and gamma-ray regimes, are essential to answer these questions. The
High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, surveying the northern TeV
gamma-ray sky, is currently the most sensitive wide field-of-view survey
instrument in the VHE (very-high-energy, $>$100 GeV) range. With more than
three years of data recorded, HAWC is ideally suited for an unbiased survey of
gamma-ray emission from galactic SNRs, particularly at TeV energies and above.
In this proceeding, I will give an overview of recent measurements of VHE
gamma-ray emission from SNRs with the HAWC Observatory. Combined with data from
other wavelengths, these measurements are used to derive information about the
underlying particle populations such as the maximum acceleration energy and
whether leptonic or hadronic processes are responsible for the emission.

Title:The inner dust shell of Betelgeuse detected by polarimetric aperture-masking interferometry,"
Abstract:  Theory surrounding the origin of the dust-laden winds from evolved stars
remains mired in controversy. Characterizing the formation loci and the dust
distribution within approximately the first stellar radius above the surface is
crucial for understanding the physics that underlie the mass-loss phenomenon.
By exploiting interferometric polarimetry, we derive the fundamental parameters
that govern the dust structure at the wind base of a red supergiant. We present
near-infrared aperture-masking observations of Betelgeuse in polarimetric mode
obtained with the NACO/SAMPol instrument. We used both parametric models and
radiative transfer simulations to predict polarimetric differential visibility
data and compared them to SPHERE/ZIMPOL measurements. Using a thin dust shell
model, we report the discovery of a dust halo that is located at only 0.5
R$_{\star}$ above the photosphere (i.e. an inner radius of the dust halo of 1.5
R$_{\star}$). By fitting the data under the assumption of Mie scattering, we
estimate the grain size and density for various dust species. By extrapolating
to the visible wavelengths using radiative transfer simulations, we compare our
model with SPHERE/ZIMPOL data and find that models based on dust mixtures that
are dominated by forsterite are most favored. Such a close dusty atmosphere has
profound implications for the dust formation mechanisms around red supergiants.

Stokes $Q/U$ map cutouts along the direction of the locally measured background
CMB polarization gradient. Using data from the SPTpol 500 deg$^{2}$ survey at
the locations of roughly 18,000 clusters with richness $\lambda \ge 10$ from
the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year-3 full galaxy cluster catalog, we detect
lensing at $4.8\sigma$. The mean stacked mass of the selected sample is found
to be $(1.43 \pm 0.4)\ \times 10^{14}\ {\rm M_{\odot}}$ which is in good
agreement with optical weak lensing based estimates using DES data and
CMB-lensing based estimates using SPTpol temperature data. This measurement is
a key first step for cluster cosmology with future low-noise CMB surveys, like
CMB-S4, for which CMB polarization will be the primary channel for cluster
lensing measurements.

Abstract:  Observations of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers via gravitational

as short gamma-ray bursts, and could provide crucial information on the nature

recent possible detection of a BH-NS merger event by the LIGO-Virgo
collaboration has attracted a lot of attention to these sources. In this second
paper of the series, we follow-up our study of the dynamical evolution of
triples comprised of an inner BH-NS binary. In particular, we examine how the
progenitor metallicity affects the characteristics of the BH-NS mergers in
triples. We determine the distributions of masses, orbital parameters and
merger times, as a function of the progenitor metallicity and initial triple
orbital distributions, and show that the typical eccentricity in the LIGO band
is $\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$. We derive a merger rate range of
$\Gamma_\mathrm{BH-NS}=1.9\times 10^{-4}-22 \ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\
\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, consistent the LIGO-Virgo upper limit. Finally, we study the
expected spin-orbit misalignments of merging BH-NS binaries from this channel,
and find that typically the effective spin distribution is peaked at $\chi_{\rm
eff}\sim 0$ with significant tails.

Abstract:  So far, cosmic ray air showers have been detected using scintillation counter
arrays on the ground widely. And also air Cherenkov detection method, which is
limited its observation period in moonless nights, has been adopted. The
detection method of radio emission from cosmic ray air showers is not new, but
rather old method. Radio emission from cosmic ray air showers has not been
detected with the method of self-trigger system. If the detection method of
radio emission were available, there is no limit of the observation like
Cherenkov counter. The developments of high radio frequency (RF) technology
might make the detection of radio emission from extensive air showers possible.
Antennas calibrated in laboratory are available. With those antennas, we can
directly obtain the absolute intensity of radio frequency from cosmic ray air
showers. Main issue to detect radio emission is that signal level is quite low.
The thermal noise particularly causes background noise source. Those issues and
detection method are discussed. We also describe an antenna detection method to
generate self-trigger signal and a method to identify air shower events from
natural and artificial noises.

Title:On the disc reflection spectroscopy of NS LMXB Serpens~X-1: analysis of a recent NuSTAR observation,"
Abstract:  We present \nustar{} observation of the atoll type neutron star (NS) low-mass
X-ray binary (LMXB) Serpens~X-1 (Ser~X-1) performed on 17 February 2018. We
observed Ser~X-1 in a soft X-ray spectral state with 3-79 keV luminosity of
$L_\text{X}\sim0.4\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\sim 23\%$ of the Eddington
luminosity), assuming a distance of 7.7 kpc. A positive correlation between
intensity and hardness ratio suggests that the source was in the banana branch
during this observation. The broadband 3-30 keV NuSTAR energy spectrum can be
well described either by a three-component continuum model consisting of a disk
blackbody, a single temperature blackbody and a power-law or by a two-component
continuum model consisting of a disk blackbody and a Comptonization component.
A broad iron line $\sim 5-8$ keV and the Compton back-scattering hump peaking
at $\sim$10-20 keV band are clearly detected in the X-ray spectrum. These
features are best interpreted by a self-consistent relativistic reflection
model. Fits with relativistically blurred disc reflection model suggests that
the inner disc radius $R_{in}$ is truncated prior to the ISCO at
$(1.9-2.5)\;R_{ISCO}$ ($\simeq11.4-15\,R_{g}\: \text{or}\: 26-34$ km) and the
accretion disc is viewed at an low inclination of $i\simeq16^\circ-20^\circ$.
The disc is likely to be truncated either by a boundary layer or by the
magnetosphere. Based on the measured flux and the mass accretion rate, the
maximum radial extension for the boundary layer is estimated to be
$\sim6.4\:R_{g}$ from the NS surface. The truncated inner disc in association

Title:BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey -- XVII: The Parsec-scale Jet Properties of the Ultra Hard X-ray Selected Local AGN,"
Abstract:  We have performed a very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) survey of local
(z < 0.05) ultra hard X-ray (14-195 keV) selected active galactic nuclei (AGN)
from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) using KVN, KaVA, and VLBA. We first
executed fringe surveys of 142 BAT-detected AGN at 15 or 22 GHz. Based on the
fringe surveys and archival data, we find 10/279 nearby AGN (~4%) VLBI have 22
GHz flux above 30 mJy. This implies that the X-ray AGN with a bright nuclear
jet are not common. Among these 10 radio-bright AGN, we obtained 22 GHz VLBI
imaging data of our own for four targets and reprocessed archival data for six
targets. We find that, although our 10 AGN observed with VLBI span a wide range
of pc-scale morphological types, they lie on a tight linear relation between
accretion luminosity and nuclear jet luminosity. Our result suggests that a
powerful nuclear radio jet correlates with the accretion disc luminosity. We
also probed the fundamental plane of black hole activity at VLBI scales (e.g.,
few milli-arcsecond). The jet luminosity and size distribution among our sample
roughly fit into the proposed AGN evolutionary scenario, finding powerful jets
after the blow-out phase based on the Eddington ratio (\lambda_{Edd})-hydrogen
column density (N_{H}) relation. In addition, we find some hints of gas inflow
or galaxy-galaxy merger in the majority of our sample. This implies that gas
supply via tidal interactions in galactic scale may help the central AGN to
launch a powerful parsec-scale jet.

Title:CO and Fine-Structure Lines Reveal Low Metallicity in a Stellar-Mass-Rich Galaxy at z ~ 1?,"
Abstract:  We present detections of the CO(4-3) and [C I] 609 $\mu$m spectral lines, as
well as the dust continuum at 480.5 GHz (rest-frame), in 3C 368, a
Fanaroff-Riley class II (FR-II) galaxy at redshift (z) 1.131. 3C 368 has a
large stellar mass, ~ 3.6 x 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$, and is undergoing an episode
of vigorous star formation, at a rate of ~ 350 M$_\odot$/yr, and active
galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, with radio-emitting lobes extended over ~ 73
kpc. Our observations allow us to inventory the molecular-gas reservoirs in 3C
368 by applying three independent methods: (1) using the CO(4-3)-line
luminosity, excitation state of the gas, and an $\alpha_{CO}$ conversion
factor, (2) scaling from the [C I]-line luminosity, and (3) adopting a
gas-to-dust conversion factor. We also present gas-phase metallicity estimates
in this source, both using far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure lines together
with radio free-free continuum emission and independently employing the optical
[O III] 5007 A and [O II] 3727 A lines (R$_{23}$ method). Both methods agree on
a sub-solar gas-phase metallicity of ~ 0.3 Z$_\odot$. Intriguingly, comparing
the molecular-gas mass estimated using this sub-solar metallicity, M$_{gas}$ ~
6.4 x 10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$, to dust-mass estimates from multi-component spectral
energy distribution (SED) modeling, M$_{dust}$ ~ 1.4 x 10$^8$ M$_\odot$, yields
a gas-to-dust ratio within ~ 15% of the accepted value for a metallicity of 0.3
Z$_\odot$. The derived gas-mass puts 3C 368 on par with other galaxies at z ~ 1
in terms of specific star-formation rate and gas fraction. However, it does not
explain how a galaxy can amass such a large stellar population while
maintaining such a low gas-phase metallicity. Perhaps 3C 368 has recently
undergone a merger, accreting pristine molecular gas from an external source.

Title:Diffuse ionized gas and its effects on nebular metallicity estimates of star-forming galaxies,"
Abstract:  We investigate the impact of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) on abundance
determinations in star-forming (SF) galaxies. The DIG is characterised using
the H$\alpha$ equivalent width ($W_{\text{H}\alpha}$). From a set of 1,409 SF
galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey, we calculate
the fractional contribution of the DIG to several emission lines using
high-$S/N$ data from SF spaxels (instead of using noisy emission-lines in
DIG-dominated spaxels). Our method is applicable to spectra with observed
$W_{\text{H}\alpha} \gtrsim 10$ angstroms (which are not dominated by DIG
emission). Since the DIG contribution depends on galactocentric distance, we
provide DIG-correction formulae for both entire galaxies and single aperture
spectra. Applying those to a sample of $\,> 90,000$ SF galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, we find the following. (1) The effect of the DIG on
strong-line abundances depends on the index used. It is negligible for the ([O
III]/H$\beta$)/([N II]/H$\alpha$) index, but reaches $\sim 0.1$ dex at the
high-metallicity end for [N II]/H$\alpha$. (2) This result is based on the
$\sim$kpc MaNGA resolution, so the real effect of the DIG is likely greater.
(3) We revisit the mass-metallicity-star formation rate (SFR) relation by
correcting for the DIG contribution in both abundances and SFR. The effect of
DIG removal is more prominent at higher stellar masses. Using the [N
II]/H$\alpha$ index, O/H increases with SFR at high stellar mass, contrary to
previous claims.

Title:Galaxy-lens determination of $H_0$: constraining density slope in the context of the mass sheet degeneracy,"
Abstract:  Gravitational lensing offers a competitive method to measure $H_0$ with the
goal of 1% precision. A major obstacle comes in the form of lensing
degeneracies, such as the mass sheet degeneracy (MSD), which make it possible
for a family of density profiles to reproduce the same lensing observables but
return different values of $H_0$. The modeling process artificially selects one
choice from this family, potentially biasing $H_0$. The effect is more
pronounced when the profile of a given lens is not perfectly described by the
lens model, which will always be the case to some extent. To explore this, we
quantify the bias and spread in $H_0$ by creating quads from two-component mass
models and fitting them with a power-law ellipse+shear model. We find that the
bias does not correspond to the estimate one would calculate by transforming
the profile into a power law near the image radius. We also emulate the effect
of including stellar kinematics by performing fits where the slope is
constrained to the true value. Informing the fit using the true value near the
image radius can introduce substantial bias (0-23% depending on the model). We
confirm using Jeans arguments that kinematic constraints can result in a biased
value of $H_0$, though the degree of bias depends on the region kinematic
modeling probes in specific lenses. We conclude that lensing degeneracies
manifest through commonplace modeling approaches in a more complicated way than
is assumed in the literature. If stellar kinematics incorrectly break the MSD,
their inclusion may introduce more bias than their omission.

"Title:An Updated SMC and Magellanic Bridge Catalog of Star Clusters, Associations and Related Objects","
Abstract:  We present a catalog of star clusters, associations and related extended
objects in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Magellanic Bridge with 2741
entries, a factor 2 more than a previous version from a decade ago. Literature
data till December 2018 are included. The identification of star clusters was
carried out with digital atlases in various bands currently available in DSS

samples from the VMC, OGLE-IV and SMASH surveys, confirming new clusters and
pointing out equivalencies. A major contribution of the present catalog
consists in the accurate central positions for clusters and small associations,
including a new sample of 45 clusters or candidates in the SMC and 19 in the
Bridge, as well as a compilation of the most reliable age and metallicity
values from the literature. A general catalog must also deal with the recent
discoveries of 27 faint and ultra-faint star clusters and galaxies projected on
the far surroundings of the Clouds, most of them from the DES survey. The
information on these objects has been complemented with photometric,
spectroscopic and kinematical follow-up data from the literature. The
underluminous galaxies around the Magellanic System, still very few as compared
to the predictions from $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter simulations, can bring
constraints to galaxy formation and hierarchical evolution. Furthermore, we
provide diagnostics, when possible, of the nature of the ultra-faint clusters,
searching for borders of the Magellanic System extensions into the Milky Way

Title:Application Usability Levels: A Framework for Tracking Project Product Progress,"
Abstract:  The space physics community continues to grow and become both more
interdisciplinary and more intertwined with commercial and government
operations. This has created a need for a framework to easily identify what
projects can be used for specific applications and how close the tool is to
routine autonomous or on-demand implementation and operation. We propose the
Application Usability Level (AUL) framework and publicizing AULs to help the
community quantify the progress of successful applications, metrics, and
validation efforts. This framework will also aid the scientific community by
supplying the type of information needed to build off of previously published
work and publicizing the applications and requirements needed by the user
communities. In this paper, we define the AUL framework, outline the milestones
required for progression to higher AULs, and provide example projects utilizing
the AUL framework. This work has been completed as part of the activities of

Title:Default Parallels: The Science Potential Of JWST Parallel Observations During TSO Primary Observations,"
Abstract:  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will observe several stars for long
cumulative durations while pursuing exoplanets as primary science targets for
both Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) and very likely General Observer (GO)
programs. Here we argue in favor of an automatic default parallels program to
observe e.g., using the F200W/F277W filters or grism of NIRCAM/NIRISS in order
to find high redshift (z >> 10) galaxies, cool red/brown dwarf-sub-stellar
objects, Solar System objects, and observations of serendipitous planetary
transits. We argue here the need for automated exploratory astrophysical
observations with unused JWST instruments during these long duration exoplanet
observations. Randomized fields that are observed in parallel mode reduce
errors due to cosmic variance more effectively than single continuous fields of
a typical wedding cake observing strategy (Trenti & Stiavelli 2008). Hence, we
argue that the proposed automated survey will explore a unique and rich
discovery space in high redshift Universe, Galactic structure, and Solar
System. We show that the GTO and highly-probable GO target list of exoplanets
covers the Galactic disk/halo and high redshift Universe, mostly well out of
the plane of the disk of the Milky Way. Exposure times are of the order of the
CEERS GTO medium deep survey in a single filter, comparable to CANDELS in HST's
surveys and deep fields. The area covered by NIRISS and NIRCam combined could
accumulate to a half square degree surveyed.

Title:CMB dipoles and other low-order multipoles in the quasispherical Szekeres model,"
Abstract:  Several authors have previously shown that Gpc-scale void based on the
spherically symmetric LTB model can provide a good fit to certain cosmological
data, including the SNIa data, but it is only consistent with the observed CMB
dipole if we are located very close to the center, in violation of the
Copernican principle. In this work we investigate the more general
quasispherical Szekeres model, which does not include spherical symmetry, in
order to determine whether this option may be less constricting. We find that
the observer is still constrained to a small region, but it is not as
geometrically ``special'' as the center of an LTB void. Furthermore, whereas
the quadrupole and octupole near the center of an LTB void are necessarily
small, certain Szekeres models can include a significant quadrupole while still
being consistent with the observed dipole, hinting that Szekeres models may be
able give an explanation for the observed quadrupole/octupole anomalies.

Title:Fundamental physics with high-energy cosmic neutrinos today and in the future,"
Abstract:  The astrophysical neutrinos discovered by IceCube have the highest detected
neutrino energies --- from TeV to PeV --- and likely travel the longest
distances --- up to a few Gpc, the size of the observable Universe. These
features make them naturally attractive probes of fundamental particle-physics
properties, possibly tiny in size, at energy scales unreachable by any other
means. The decades before the IceCube discovery saw many proposals of
particle-physics studies in this direction. Today, those proposals have become
a reality, in spite of astrophysical unknowns. We will showcase examples of
doing fundamental neutrino physics at these scales, including some of the most
stringent tests of physics beyond the Standard Model. In the future, larger
neutrino energies --- up to tens of EeV --- could be observed with larger
detectors and further our reach.

Title:Development of a Cherenkov Telescope for the Detection of Ultrahigh Energy Neutrinos with EUSO-SPB2 and POEMMA,"
Abstract:  The detection of astrophysical neutrinos by IceCube and the potential to
constrain source models of ultra-high energy cosmic rays provide the motivation
to develop instruments for the observation of neutrinos above $10^7$ GeV. Among
the different techniques to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos is the
Earth-skimming technique. It makes use of the fact that the tau produced in a
tau neutrino interaction inside the Earth can emerge from the ground and
initiate an upward-going particle shower in the atmosphere. The particle shower
and thus the neutrino can be reconstructed by measuring the Cherenkov and radio
emission from the shower particles. In this presentation, we discuss our
ongoing development of a Cherenkov telescope for the detection of tau
neutrinos, which is to be deployed on the Extreme Universe Space Observatory
Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) and is a precursor experiment for the
proposed Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) mission. POEMMA
aims at the detection of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays and ultrahigh energy
neutrinos from low earth orbit. The 1 m$^2$ Cherenkov telescope for EUSO-SPB2

Title:Trinity: An Air-Shower Imaging System for the Detection of Ultrahigh Energy Neutrinos,"
Abstract:  Efforts to detect ultrahigh energy neutrinos are driven by several
objectives: What is the origin of astrophysical neutrinos detected with
IceCube? What are the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays? Do the ANITA
detected events point to new physics? Shedding light on these questions
requires instruments that can detect neutrinos above $10^7$ GeV with sufficient
sensitivity - a daunting task. While most ultrahigh energy neutrino experiments
are based on the detection of a radio signature from shower particles following
a neutrino interaction, we believe that the detection of Cherenkov and
fluorescence light from shower particles is an attractive alternative. Imaging
air showers with Cherenkov and fluorescence light is a technique that is
successfully used in several ultrahigh energy cosmic ray and very-high energy
gamma-ray experiments. We performed a case study of an air-shower imaging
system for the detection of earth-skimming tau neutrinos. The detector
configuration we consider consists of an imaging system that is located on top
of a mountain and is pointed at the horizon. From the results of this study we
conclude that a sensitivity of $3\cdot10^{-9}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$
can be achieved at $2\cdot10^8$ GeV with a relatively small and modular system
after three years of observation. In this presentation we discuss key findings
of our study and how they translate into design requirements for an imaging
system we dub Trinity.

Title:A New Automatic Tool for CME Detection and Tracking with Machine Learning Techniques,"
Abstract:  With the accumulation of big data of CME observations by coronagraphs,
automatic detection and tracking of CMEs has proven to be crucial. The
excellent performance of convolutional neural network in image classification,
object detection and other computer vision tasks motivates us to apply it to
CME detection and tracking as well. We have developed a new tool for CME
Automatic detection and tracking with MachinE Learning (CAMEL) techniques. The
system is a three-module pipeline. It is first a supervised image
classification problem. We solve it by training a neural network LeNet with
training labels obtained from an existing CME catalog. Those images containing
CME structures are flagged as CME images. Next, to identify the CME region in
each CME-flagged image, we use deep descriptor transforming to localize the
common object in an image set. A following step is to apply the graph cut
technique to finely tune the detected CME region. To track the CME in an image
sequence, the binary images with detected CME pixels are converted from
cartesian to polar coordinate. A CME event is labeled if it can move in at
least two frames and reach the edge of coronagraph field of view. For each
event, a few fundamental parameters are derived. The results of four
representative CMEs with various characteristics are presented and compared
with those from four existing automatic and manual catalogs. We find that CAMEL
can detect more complete and weaker structures, and has better performance to
catch a CME as early as possible.

transfer of the envelope of the sdO progenitor to our primary star, now being a

Abstract:  Recent research shows that the spectral lag is closely related to the
spectral evolution in GRBs. In this paper, we study the spectral lag for a
radiating jet shell with a high-energy cut-off radiation spectrum. For the jet
shell with a cut-off power-law spectrum, the spectral lag monotonically
increases with the photon energy and levels off at a certain photon energy. It
is the same for the jet shell with a Band cut-off spectrum (Bandcut). However,
a turn-over from the positive lags to negative lags appears in the high-energy
range for the jet shell with Bandcut, which is very similar to that observed in
GRB~160625B. The dependence of the spectral lags on the spectral
shape/evolution are studied in details. In addition, the spectral lag behavior
observed in GRB~160625B is naturally reproduced based on our theoretical
outcome.

Title:Accurate mass estimates from the proper motions of dispersion-supported galaxies,"
Abstract:  Starting with the spherical Jeans equation, we show that there exists a
radius where the mass enclosed depends only on the projected tangential
velocity dispersion, assuming that the anisotropy profile slowly varies. This
is well-approximated at the radius where the log-slope of the stellar tracer
profile is $-2$: $r_{-2}$. The associated mass is $M(r_{-2}) = 2 G^{-1} \langle
\sigma_{\mathcal{T}}^{2}\rangle^{*} r_{-2}$ and the circular velocity is
$V^{2}({r_{-2}}) = 2\langle \sigma_{\mathcal{T}}^{2}\rangle^{*}$. For a Plummer
profile $r_{-2} \simeq 4R_e/5$. Importantly, $r_{-2}$ is smaller than the
characteristic radius for line-of-sight velocities derived by Wolf et al. 2010.
Together, the two estimators can constrain the mass profiles of
dispersion-supported galaxies. We illustrate its applicability using published
proper motion measurements of dwarf galaxies Draco and Sculptor, and find that
they are consistent with inhabiting cuspy NFW subhalos of the kind predicted in
CDM but we cannot rule out a core. We test our combined mass estimators against
previously-published, non-spherical cosmological dwarf galaxy simulations done
in both CDM and SIDM. For CDM, the estimates for the dynamic rotation curves
are found to be accurate to $10\%$ while SIDM are accurate to $15\%$.
Unfortunately, this level of accuracy is not good enough to measure slopes at
the level required to distinguish between cusps and cores of the type predicted
in viable SIDM models without stronger priors. However, we find that this
provides good enough accuracy to distinguish between the normalization
differences predicted at small radii ($r \simeq r_{-2} < r_{\rm core}$) for
interesting SIDM models. As the number of galaxies with internal proper motions
increases, mass estimators of this kind will enable valuable constraints on
SIDM and CDM models.

Title:X-Ray Spectrum of RBS 315: Absorption or Intrinsic Curvature,"
Abstract:  X-ray absorption of high-redshift quasars is enigmatic, because it remains
unclear where in the universe the absorbing gas is. If absorption occurs near
the high-z host, it could help us understand early stages of galaxy formation.
If it is in the intergalactic medium (IGM), it provides a unique way to probe
this elusive baryon component. We report on observations of one of the
brightest X-ray sources at a high redshift, RBS 315 (z=2.69). Despite several
previous analyses, no definite conclusion as to the source of the curvature in
its spectrum, whether absorption or intrinsic, could be reached. We present
observations by XMM-Newton (EPIC and RGS) as well as NuSTAR and Swift/XRT. The
XMM-Newton spectra of this source are of unprecedented quality. A purely
statistical analysis of the CCD spectra yields no clear results - the spectrum
is as likely to be photo-electrically absorbed as it is to be curved at the
source, and no constraint on the position of the absorber can be obtained.
Assuming absorption governs the spectral curvature, the lack of absorption
lines in the grating spectra indicates the absorber is not well localized in
redshift space, and could be dispersed over the cosmological scales of the IGM.
Intrinsic curvature, however, can not be unambiguously ruled out.

Title:A high time resolution study of the millisecond pulsar J2241-5236 at frequencies below 300 MHz,"
Abstract:  One of the major challenges for pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments is the
mitigation of the effects of the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) from
timing data. These can potentially lead to measurable delays and/or distortions
in the pulse profiles and scale strongly with the inverse of the radio
frequency. Low-frequency observations are therefore highly appealing for
characterizing them. However, in order to achieve the necessary time resolution
to resolve profile features of short-period millisecond pulsars, phase-coherent
de-dispersion is essential, especially at frequencies below $300$ MHz. We
present the lowest-frequency ($80$-$220$ MHz), coherently de-dispersed
detections of one of the most promising pulsars for current and future PTAs,
PSR J2241$-$5236, using our new beam-former software for the MWA's voltage
capture system (VCS), which reconstructs the time series at a much higher time
resolution of $\sim 1 \mu$s by re-synthesizing the recorded voltage data at
$10$-kHz/$100$-$\mu$s native resolutions. Our data reveal a dual-precursor type
feature in the pulse profile that is either faint or absent in high-frequency
observations from Parkes. The resultant high-fidelity detections have enabled
dispersion measure (DM) determinations with very high precision, of the order
of $(2$-$6)\times10^{-6}$ $\rm pc\,cm^{-3}$, owing to the microsecond level
timing achievable for this pulsar at the MWA's low frequencies. This
underscores the usefulness of low-frequency observations for probing the ISM
toward PTA pulsars and informing optimal observing strategies for PTA
experiments.

Title:Evidence for Vortex Shedding in the Sun's Hot Corona,"
Abstract:  Vortex shedding is an oscillating flow that is commonly observed in fluids
due to the presence of a blunt body in a flowing medium. Numerical simulations
have shown that the phenomenon of vortex shedding could also develop in the
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) domain. The dimensionless Strouhal number, the ratio
of the blunt body diameter to the product of the period of vortex shedding and
the speed of a flowing medium, is a robust indicator for vortex shedding, and,
generally of the order of 0.2 for a wide range of Reynolds number. Using an
observation from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory, we report a wavelike or oscillating plasma flow propagating upward
against the Sun's gravitational force. A newly formed shrinking loop in the
post-flare region possibly generates the oscillation of the upflow in the wake
of the hot and dense loop through vortex shedding. The computed Strouhal number
is consistent with the prediction from previous MHD simulations. Our
observation suggests the possibility of vortex shedding in the solar corona.

Title:Weibel-Mediated Shocks Propagating into Inhomogeneous Electron-Positron Plasmas,"
Abstract:  The external forward shock emitting the gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow is
collisionless, and it is mediated by the Weibel instability which generates the
magnetic field. The GRB afterglow shows that the magnetic field in the large
downstream region is much stronger than the shock-compressed pre-shock field.
However, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic shocks propagating
into homogeneous media show that the Weibel generated field decays near the
shock front. Some GRB observations and theoretical studies suggest that the
preshock medium is inhomogeneous. We perform the PIC simulation of a
relativistic shock propagating into inhomogeneous plasma. It is found that the
post-shock magnetic field decays slowly compared with the homogeneous case.
Sound waves and entropy waves are also generated by the shock-wave interaction,
and temperature anisotropy is produced by the sound wave in the downstream
region. The free energy of the temperature anisotropy is large enough to
explain the observed field strength. Our results show that the upstream density
fluctuation has a significant effect in the downstream region of collisionless
shocks even if the wavelength of the upstream inhomogeneity is much larger than

Title:Synthesis of the distribution function of ISN He,"
Abstract:  Interaction of the solar wind with interstellar matter involves, among other,
charge exchange between interstellar neutral atoms and plasma, which results in
the creation of secondary population of interstellar neutral (ISN) atoms. The
secondary population of interstellar He was detected by Interstellar Boundary
Explorer (IBEX), but interpretation of these measurements was mostly based on
an approximation that the primary interstellar neutral population and the
secondary population were non-interacting homogeneous Maxwell-Boltzmann
functions in the outer heliosheath. We simulate the distribution function in
the outer heliosheath and inside the heliopause using method of characteristics
with statistical weights obtained from solutions of the production and loss
equations for the secondary atoms due to charge-exchange collisions in the
outer heliosheath. We show that the two-Maxwellian approximation for the
distribution function of neutral He is not a good approximation within the
outer heliosheath but a reasonable one inside the termination shock. This is
due to a strong selection effect: the He atoms able to penetrate inside the
termination shock are a small, peculiar subset of the entire secondary He
population. Nevertheless, the two-Maxwellian approximation reproduces the
density distribution of ISN He inside the termination shock well and enables a
realistic reproduction of the orientation of the plane defined by the Sun's
velocity vector through the local interstellar matter and the vector of
unperturbed interstellar magnetic field.

Title:Strongly magnetized accretion disks: structure and accretion from global magnetohydrodynamic simulations,"
Abstract:  We use global magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the influence of net
vertical magnetic fields on the structure of geometrically thin ($H/r \approx
0.05$) accretion disks in the Newtonian limit. We consider initial mid-plane
gas to magnetic pressure ratios $\beta_0 = 1000,\, 300$ and $100$, spanning the
transition between weakly and strongly magnetized accretion regimes. We find
that magnetic pressure is important for the disks' vertical structure in all
three cases, with accretion occurring at $z/R\approx 0.2$ in the two most
strongly magnetized models. The disk midplane shows outflow rather than
accretion. Accretion through the surface layers is driven mainly by stress due
to coherent large scale magnetic field rather than by turbulent stress.
Equivalent viscosity parameters measured from our simulations show similar
dependencies on initial $\beta_0$ to those seen in shearing box simulations,
though the disk midplane is not magnetic pressure dominated even for the
strongest magnetic field case. Winds are present but are not the dominant
driver of disk evolution. Over the (limited) duration of our simulations, we
find evidence that the net flux attains a quasi-steady state at levels that can
stably maintain a strongly magnetized disk. We suggest that geometrically thin
accretion disks in observed systems may commonly exist in a magnetically
""elevated"" state, characterized by non-zero but modest vertical magnetic
fluxes, with potentially important implications for disk phenomenology in X-ray
binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN).

Title:Entrapment of CO in CO2 ice,"
Abstract:  Planet atmosphere and hydrosphere compositions are fundamentally set by
accretion of volatiles, and therefore by the division of volatiles between gas
and solids in planet-forming disks. For hyper-volatiles such as CO, this
division is regulated by a combination of binding energies, and by the ability
of other ice components to entrap. Water ice is known for its ability to trap
CO and other volatile species. In this study we explore whether another common
interstellar and cometary ice component, CO2, is able to trap CO as well. We
measure entrapment of CO molecules in CO2 ice through temperature programmed
desorption (TPD) experiments on CO2:CO ice mixtures. We find that CO2 ice traps
CO with a typical efficiency of 40-60% of the initially deposited CO molecules
for a range of ice thicknesses between 7 and 50ML, and ice mixture ratios
between 1:1 and 9:1. The entrapment efficiency increases with ice thickness and
CO dilution. We also run analogous H2O:CO experiments and find that under
comparable experimental conditions CO2 ice entraps CO more efficiently than H2O
ice up to the onset of CO2 desorption at ~70K. We speculate that this may be
due to different ice restructuring dynamics in H2O and CO2 ices around the CO
desorption temperature. Importantly, the ability of CO2 to entrap CO may change
the expected division between gas and solids for CO and other hyper-volatiles
exterior to the CO2 snowline during planet formation.

Title:A Compton polarimeter using scintillators read out with MPPCs through Citiroc ASIC,"
Abstract:  In recent years, a number of purpose-built scintillator-based polarimeters
have studied bright astronomical sources for the first time in the hard X-ray
band (tens to hundreds of keV). The addition of polarimetry can help data
interpretation by resolving model-dependent degeneracies. The typical
instrument approach is that incident X-rays scatter off a plastic scintillator
into an adjacent scintillator cell. In all missions to date, the scintillators
are read out using traditional vacuum tube photo-multipliers (PMTs). The advent
of solid-state PMTs (""silicon PM"" or ""MPPC"") is attractive for space-based
instruments since the devices are compact, robust and require a low bias
voltage. We have characterised the plastic scintillator, EJ-248M, optically
coupled to a multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) and read out with the Citiroc
ASIC. A light-yield of 1.6 photoelectrons/keV has been obtained, with a low
energy detection threshold of $\lesssim$5 keV at room temperature. We have also
constructed an MPPC-based polarimeter-demonstrator in order to investigate the
feasibility of such an approach for future instruments. Incident X-rays scatter
from a plastic-scintillator bar to surrounding cerium-doped GAGG (Gadolinium
Aluminium Gallium Garnet) scintillators yielding time-coincident signals in the
scintillators. We have determined the polarimetric response of this set-up
using both unpolarised and polarised $\sim$50 keV X-rays. We observe a clear
asymmetry in the GAGG counting rates for the polarised beam. The low-energy
detection threshold in the plastic scintillator can be further reduced using a
coincidence technique. The demonstrated polarimeter design shows promise as a
space-based Compton polarimeter and we discuss ways in which our polarimeter
can be adapted for such a mission.

Title:Performance of a low-parasitic frequency-domain multiplexing readout,"
Abstract:  Frequency-domain multiplexing is a readout technique for transition edge
sensor bolometer arrays used on modern CMB experiments, including the SPT-3G
receiver. Here, we present design details and performance measurements for a
low-parasitic frequency-domain multiplexing readout. Reducing the parasitic
impedance of the connections between cryogenic components provides a path to
improving both the crosstalk and noise performance of the readout. Reduced
crosstalk will in turn allow higher multiplexing factors. We have demonstrated
a factor of two improvement in parasitic resistance compared to SPT-3G
hardware. Reduced parasitics also permits operation of lower-resistance
bolometers, which enables better optimization of R$_{\rm{bolo}}$ for improved
readout noise performance. The prototype system exhibits noise performance
comparable to SPT-3G readout hardware when operating SPT-3G detectors.

Title:LOFAR first look at the giant radio galaxy 3C 236,"
Abstract:  We have examined the giant radio galaxy 3C~236 using LOFAR at 143 MHz down to
an angular resolution of 7"", in combination with observations at higher
frequencies. We have used the low frequency data to derive spectral index maps
with the highest resolution yet at these low frequencies. We confirm a previous
detection of an inner hotspot in the north-west lobe and for the first time
observe that the south-east lobe hotspot is in fact a triple hotspot, which may
point to an intermittent source activity. Also, the spectral index map of 3C
236 shows that the spectral steepening at the inner region of the northern lobe
is prominent at low frequencies. The outer regions of both lobes show spectral
flattening, in contrast with previous high frequency studies. We derive
spectral age estimates for the lobes, as well as particle densities of the IGM
at various locations. We propose that the morphological differences between the
lobes are driven by variations in the ambient medium density as well as the
source activity history.

Title:Magnetic field strengths of hot Jupiters from signals of star-planet interactions,"
Abstract:  Evidence of star-planet interactions in the form of planet-modulated
chromospheric emission has been noted for a number of hot Jupiters. Magnetic
star-planet interactions involve the release of energy stored in the stellar
and planetary magnetic fields. These signals thus offer indirect detections of
exoplanetary magnetic fields. Here we report the derivation of the magnetic
field strengths of four hot Jupiter systems using the power observed in Ca II K
emission modulated by magnetic star-planet interactions. By approximating the
fractional energy released in the Ca II K line we find that the surface
magnetic field values for the hot Jupiters in our sample range from 20 G to 120
G, ~10-100 times larger than the values predicted by dynamo scaling laws for
planets with rotation periods of ~2 - 4 days. On the other hand, these value
are in agreement with scaling laws relating the magnetic field strength to the
internal heat flux in giant planets. Large planetary magnetic field strengths
may produce observable electron-cyclotron maser radio emission by preventing
the maser from being quenched by the planet's ionosphere. Intensive radio
monitoring of hot Jupiter systems will help confirm these field values and
inform on the generation mechanism of magnetic fields in this important class
of exoplanets.

Title:Massive White Dwarfs in the Galactic Center: A Chandra X-ray Spectroscopy of Cataclysmic Variables,"
Abstract:  Previous X-ray observations toward the Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) at the
Galactic center have discovered thousands of point sources, most of which were
believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs), i.e., a white dwarf (WD) accreting
from a low-mass companion. However, the population properties of these CVs
remain unclear, which otherwise contain important information about the
evolutionary history of the NSC. In this work we utilize ultradeep archival
\textit{Chandra} observations to study the spectral properties of the NSC CVs,
in close comparison with those in the Solar vicinity. We find that the NSC CVs
have strong Fe XXV and Fe XXVI lines (both of which show equivalent widths
$\sim200-300$ eV), indicating metal-rich companions. Moreover, their Fe XXVI to
Fe XXV line flux ratio is used to diagnose the characteristic white dwarf mass
($M_{\rm WD}$) of NSC CVs. The results show that the CVs with $L_{\rm 2-10
keV}>6\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$ have a mean $M_{\rm WD}$ of
$\sim0.6/1.0\,M_{\odot}$ if they are magnetic/non-magnetic CVs; while those
with $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}$ between $1-6\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$ have a mean
$M_{\rm WD}$ of $\sim0.8/1.2\,M_{\odot}$ if they are magnetic/non-magnetic CVs.
All these \textit{Chandra}-detected CVs collectively contribute $\sim$30-50\%
of the unresolved 20-40 keV X-ray emission from the NSC. The CV population with
massive (i.e., $M_{\rm WD}\sim1.2M_{\odot}$) WDs have not been observed in the
Solar vicinity or the Galactic bulge, and they might have been formed via
dynamical encounters in the NSC.

Title:Enabling martian habitability with silica aerogel via the solid-state greenhouse effect,"
Abstract:  The low temperatures and high ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels at the
surface of Mars today currently preclude the survival of life anywhere except
perhaps in limited subsurface niches. Several ideas for making the martian
surface more habitable have been put forward previously, but they all involve
massive environmental modification that will be well beyond human capability
for the foreseeable future. Here we present a new approach to this problem. We
show that widespread regions of the surface of Mars could be made habitable to
photosynthetic life in the future via a solid-state analogue to Earth's
atmospheric greenhouse effect. Specifically, we demonstrate via experiments and
modelling that under martian environmental conditions, a 2 to 3-cm thick layer
of silica (SiO2) aerogel will simultaneously transmit sufficient visible light
for photosynthesis, block hazardous ultraviolet radiation, and raise
temperatures underneath permanently to above the melting point of water,
without the need for any internal heat source. Placing silica aerogel shields
over sufficiently ice-rich regions of the martian surface could therefore allow
photosynthetic life to survive there with minimal subsequent intervention. This
regional approach to making Mars habitable is much more achievable than global
atmospheric modification. In addition, it can be developed systematically
starting from minimal resources, and can be further tested in extreme
environments on Earth today.

Title:Near-resonance tidal evolution of the Earth-Moon system influenced by orbital-scale climate change,"
Abstract:  We build a conceptual coupled model of the climate and tidal evolution of the
Earth-Moon system to find the influence of the former on the latter. An energy
balance model is applied to calculate steady-state temperature field from the
mean annual insolation as a function of varying astronomical parameters. A
harmonic oscillator model is applied to integrate the lunar orbit and Earth's
rotation with the tidal torque dependent on the dominant natural frequency of
ocean. An ocean geometry acts as a bridge between temperature and oceanic
frequency. On assumptions of a fixed hemispherical continent and an equatorial
circular lunar orbit, considering only the 41 kyr periodicity of Earth's
obliquity $\varepsilon$ and the $M_2$ tide, simulations are performed near
tidal resonance for $10^6$ yr. It is verified that the climate can influence
the tidal evolution via ocean. Compared with the tidal evolution with constant
$\varepsilon$, that with varying $\varepsilon$ is slowed down; the Earth-Moon
distance oscillates in phase with $\varepsilon$ before the resonance maximum
but exactly out of phase after that; the displacement of the oscillation is in
positive correlation with the difference between oceanic frequency and tidal
frequency.

Title:Autocorrelations in pulsar glitch waiting times and sizes,"
Abstract:  Among the five pulsars with the most recorded rotational glitches, only PSR
J0534$+$2200 is found to have an autocorrelation between consecutive glitch
sizes which differs significantly from zero (Spearman correlation coefficient
$\rho=-0.46$, p-value $=0.046$). No statistically compelling autocorrelations
between consecutive waiting times are found. The autocorrelation observations
are interpreted within the framework of a predictive meta-model describing
stress-release in terms of a state-dependent Poisson process. Specific
combinations of size and waiting time autocorrelations are identified,
alongside combinations of cross-correlations and size and waiting time
distributions, that are allowed or excluded within the meta-model. For example,
future observations of any ""quasiperiodic"" glitching pulsar, such as PSR
J0537$-$6910, should not reveal a positive waiting time autocorrelation. The
implications for microphysical models of the stress-release process driving
pulsar glitches are discussed briefly.

Title:Excursion set peaks in energy as a model for haloes,"
Abstract:  The simplest models of dark matter halo formation are based on the heuristic
assumption, motivated by spherical collapse, that virialized haloes originate
from initial regions that are maxima of the smoothed density field. Here, we
replace this notion with the dynamical requirement that protohalo patches be
regions where the local gravitational flow converges to a point. For this
purpose, we look for spheres whose gravitational acceleration at the boundary
-- relative to their center of mass -- points towards their geometric center:
that is, spheres with null dipole moment. We show that these configurations are
minima of the total energy, i.e. the most energetically bound spheres. For this
reason, we study peaks of the energy overdensity field, and argue that the
approach shows considerable promise. This change simply requires that one
modify the standard top-hat filter, with the added important benefit that, for
power spectra of cosmological interest, the resulting model is no longer
plagued by divergences. Although the formalism is no more complicated than the
overdensity based approach, the model is richer in the sense that it naturally
predicts scatter in the overdensities of protohalo patches that are destined to
form haloes of the same mass, in qualitative agreement with simulations of halo
formation.

elucidate the ion acceleration process. The X8.2 event was a limb flare that
proved adequate for fixing the parameters needed to explain the process of
particle acceleration into high energies. According to our analysis, the
electron acceleration process may possibly be explained by the shock
acceleration model. However, we found that it would be difficult to explain the
simultaneous acceleration of ions with electrons, unless the ions were
preheated prior to their rapid acceleration.

Title:Circumstellar envelopes of semi-regular long-period variables: mass-loss rate estimates and general model-fitting of the molecular gas,"
Abstract:  We aim to study the main properties of a volume-limited unbiased sample of
well-characterized semi-regular variables (SRs) in order to clarify important
issues, such as the formation of axially symmetric planetary nebulae (PNe) from
spherical circumstellar envelopes (CSEs), which takes place during the
mass-loss process along the AGB phase. We present new high-S/N IRAM 30m
observations of the 12CO J=2-1, J=1-0, and 13CO J=1-0 lines, in a
volume-limited sample of SRs. We analyzed the data by characterizing the main
properties of the CSEs. The 12CO J=2-1 data were used to study the profiles,
while the 12CO J=1-0 data were used to estimate mass-loss rates for the
complete sample. We have classified the sources into four groups according to
the different profiles and final gas expansion velocities. Type 1 and 2
profiles are broad and narrow symmetric lines, respectively. Type 3 profiles on
the contrary are strange profiles with very pronounced asymmetries. Finally,
type 4 profiles are those showing two different components: a narrow line
profile superimposed on a broad pedestal component. Interestingly, we report a
moderate correlation between mass-loss rates and 12CO J=1-0/J=2-1 line
intensity ratios for O-rich SRs, suggesting a different behaviour between C-
and O-rich SRs. Using SHAPE+shapemol, we find a unified simple model based on
an oblate spheroid placed in different orientations that may explain all the
12CO profiles in the sample, indicating that the gas expansion is in general
predominantly equatorial. Moreover, in order to explain the type 4 profiles, we
define an extra component which may somehow be a biconical structure or
similar. Type 1 and 2 profiles, curiously, may also be explained by standard
spherically symmetric envelopes. We conclude that most circumstellar shells
around SRs show axial, strongly nonspherical symmetry.

Abstract:  The propagation of uncertainties in reaction cross sections and rates of

abundances obtained in nucleosynthesis models is an important issue in studies
of nucleosynthesis and Galactic Chemical Evolution. We developed a Monte Carlo
method to allow large-scale postprocessing studies of the impact of nuclear
uncertainties on nucleosynthesis. Temperature-dependent rate uncertainties
combining realistic experimental and theoretical uncertainties are used. From
detailed statistical analyses uncertainties in the final abundances are derived
as probability density distributions. Furthermore, based on rate and abundance
correlations an automated procedure identifies the most important reactions in
complex flow patterns from superposition of many zones or tracers. The method
so far was already applied to a number of nucleosynthesis processes. Here we
focus on the production of p-nuclei in white dwarfs exploding as thermonuclear
(type Ia) supernovae. We find generally small uncertainties in the final
abundances despite of the dominance of theoretical nuclear uncertainties. A
separate analysis of low- and high-density regions indicates that the total
uncertainties are dominated by the high-density regions.

column density. Thanks to the high-quality NuSTAR and XMM-Newton data we were

thin, confirming a previously observed trend, i.e., that a significant fraction

Abstract:  Recent rapid development of deep learning algorithms, which can implicitly
capture structures in high-dimensional data, opens a new chapter in
astronomical data analysis. We report here a new implementation of deep
learning techniques for X-ray analysis. We apply a variational autoencoder
(VAE) using a deep neural network for spatio-spectral analysis of data obtained
by Chandra X-ray Observatory from Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR). We
established an unsupervised learning method combining the VAE and a Gaussian
mixture model (GMM), where the dimensions of the observed spectral data are
reduced by the VAE, and clustering in feature space is performed by the GMM. We
found that some characteristic spatial structures, such as the iron knot on the
eastern rim, can be automatically recognised by this method, which uses only
spectral properties. This result shows that unsupervised machine learning can
be useful for extracting characteristic spatial structures from spectral
information in observational data (without detailed spectral analysis), which
would reduce human-intensive preprocessing costs for understanding fine
structures in diffuse astronomical objects, e.g., SNRs or clusters of galaxies.
Such data-driven analysis can be used to select regions from which to extract
spectra for detailed analysis and help us make the best use of the large amount
of spectral data available currently and arriving in the coming decades.

Abstract:  FlashCam is a camera proposed for the medium-sized telescopes of the
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). We compare camera trigger rates obtained from
measurements with the camera prototype in the laboratory and Monte-Carlo
simulations, when scanning the parameter space of the fully-digital trigger
logic and the intensity of a continuous light source mimicking the night sky
background (NSB) during on-site operation. The comparisons of the measured data
results to the Monte-Carlo simulations are used to verify the FlashCam trigger
logic and the expected trigger performance.

Title:Steepening of Cosmic Ray Spectra in Shocks with Varying Magnetic Field Direction,"
Abstract:  Cosmic ray (CR) spectra, both measured upon their arrival at the Earth's
atmosphere and inferred from the emission in supernova remnants (SNRs), appear
to be significantly steeper than the ""standard"" diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA) theory predicts. Although the reconstruction of the primary spectra
introduces an additional steepening due to propagation effects, there is a
growing consensus in the CR community that these corrections fall short to
explain the newest high-precision data. Using 2D hybrid simulations, we
investigate a new mechanism that may steepen the spectrum during the
acceleration in SNR shocks.
Most of the DSA treatments are limited to homogeneous shock environments. To
investigate whether inhomogeneity effects can produce the necessary extra
steepening, we assume that the magnetic field changes its angle along the shock
front. The rationale behind this approach is the strong dependence of the DSA
efficiency upon the field angle, $\theta_\mathrm{Bn}$. Our results show that
the variation of shock obliquity along its face results in a noticeable
steepening of the DSA spectrum. Compared to simulations of quasi-parallel
shocks, we observe an increase of the spectral index by $\Delta q=0.1-0.15$.
Possible extrapolation of the limited simulation results to more realistic SNR
conditions are briefly considered.

Title:Water masers in Compton-thick AGN II. The high detection rate and EVN observations of IRAS 15480-0344,"
Abstract:  Investigations of H$_2$O maser galaxies at X-ray energies reveal that most
AGN associated with water masers are characterized by high levels of
absorption. With the aim of finding new maser sources for possible
interferometric follow-ups, we have searched for water maser emission in a
well-defined sample of heavily absorbed AGN ($N_{\rm H} > 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$),
including Compton-thick (CT) sources. All the galaxies in the sample were
already searched for 22 GHz water maser emission in previous surveys. With the
goal of providing a detection or a stringent upper limit on the H$_2$O
luminosity, we re-observed some of the non-detected sources with the Green Bank
Telescope. A new luminous H$_2$O maser ($L_{\rm H2O} \sim 200\,$L$_\odot$) was
detected in the mid-IR-bright Seyfert 2 galaxy IRAS 15480-0344 and then
followed-up with the Very Long Baseline Array. In order to shed light on the
origin of the maser (jet/outflow vs. disc), we recently observed the radio
continuum emission in IRAS 15480-0344 with the European VLBI network (EVN) at
1.7 and 5.0 GHz. With the newly discovered megamaser in IRAS 15480-0344
revealing a narrow ($\sim$0.6 km s$^{-1}$) and a broad ($\sim$90 km s$^{-1}$)
component, the maser detection rate of the CT AGN sample is 50% (18/36), which
is one of the highest ever found in maser surveys. The EVN maps show two bright
sources (labeled SW and NE) in the nuclear region of IRAS 15480-0344, which we
interpret as jet knots tracing regions where the radio plasma impacts dense
molecular clouds. [abridged]

Title:Commissioning and Performance of CHEC-S -- a compact high-energy camera for the Cherenkov Telescope Array,"
Abstract:  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will present the next leap forward in
gamma-ray astronomy, pushing beyond the present energy frontier to probe beyond
300 TeV. This capability is provided by the 70 Small Sized Telescopes (SSTs).
The SSTs are spread across the four square kilometres of the array to detect
the rare, but bright, Cherenkov showers produced by the highest-energy gamma
rays. One proposed camera design for the SSTs is the Compact High Energy Camera
(CHEC). Its compact and curved focal plane design is tailored for dual-mirror
Schwarzschild-Couder telescopes, making it compatible with two of the three
telescope proposals for the SSTs. The latest design of CHEC (known as CHEC-S)
utilises silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs); an attractive alternative to
traditional photomultiplier tubes, offering improved photon detection
efficiency and photoelectron counting resolution for a large dynamic range,
across tightly-packed pixels. However, SiPMs suffer from the phenomena of
optical crosstalk, which degrades the ability to resolve the number of photons
incident on the photosensor. CHEC-S also features full-waveform readout at
nanosecond sampling resolution with a flexible trigger scheme. This is
facilitated by the TARGET (TeV Array Read-out with GSa/s sampling and Event
Trigger) modules attached to the SiPMs. This contribution describes the concept
and technical design of CHEC-S and displays the key performance results,
matched against the criteria required for a CTA camera. The limitation caused
by the optical crosstalk of the SiPM is highlighted, and the expected
performance with more recent iterations of the photosensor technology is also
demonstrated.

Title:Searching for correlations in GAIA DR2 unbound star trajectories,"
Abstract:  Scattering events with compact objects are expected in the primordial black
hole (PBH) cold dark matter (CDM) scenario due to close encounters between
stars and PBH in the dense environments of dwarf spheroidals. We develop a
Bayesian framework to search for correlations among Milky Way stellar
trajectories and those of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in the halo, and
other nearby galaxies. We apply the method to a selection of hypervelocity
stars (HVS) and globular clusters from Gaia DR2 catalog, and known nearby
(mostly dwarf) galaxies with full phase-space and size measurements. We report
positive evidence for trajectory intersection $\sim$20-40 Myr ago of up to 2
stars, depending on priors, with the Sagittarius dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxy
when assuming Marchetti et al. (2019) distance estimates. We verify that the
result is compatible with their evolutionary status, setting a lower bound for
the stellar age of $\sim$100 Myr. However, such scattering events are not
confirmed when assuming Anders et al. (2019) distance estimates. We discuss
shortcomings related to present data quality and future prospects for detection
of HVS with the full Gaia catalog and Sagittarius dSph.

Title:Multiplanet systems in inviscid discs can avoid forming resonant chains,"
Abstract:  Convergent migration involving multiple planets embedded in a viscous
protoplanetary disc is expected to produce a chain of planets in mean motion
resonances, but the multiplanet systems observed by the Kepler spacecraft are
generally not in resonance. We demonstrate that under equivalent conditions,
where in a viscous disc convergent migration will form a long-term stable
system of planets in a chain of mean motion resonances, migration in an
inviscid disc often produces a system which is highly dynamically unstable. In
particular, if planets are massive enough to significantly perturb the disc
surface density and drive vortex formation, the smooth capture of planets into
mean motion resonances is disrupted. As planets pile up in close orbits, not
protected by resonances, close encounters increase the probability of
planet-planet collisions, even while the gas disc is still present. While
inviscid discs often produce unstable non-resonant systems, stable, closely
packed, non-resonant systems can also be formed. Thus, when examining the
expectation for planet migration to produce planetary systems in mean motion
resonances, the effective turbulent viscosity of the protoplanetary disc is a
key parameter.

Title:2003-2018 Monitoring of the Crab Nebula Polarization in hard X-rays with INTEGRAL SPI,"
Abstract:  We have analyzed 16 years of observations dedicated to the Crab (pulsar +
nebula) with the INTEGRAL SPI instrument to investigate its polarization
properties. We find that the source presents a substantially polarized emission
(PF = 24%) in the hard X-ray domain, with the electric vector aligned with the
pulsar spin axis, in agreement with other results at various wavelengths. The
stability of the polarization characteristics with energy and over the 16 years
covered by the data is remarkable, completing the standard candle status of the
source in the spectral domain. The polarization measurements imply that the
synchrotron emission is the dominant mechanism of photon production from radio
to hard X-rays. The high level of polarized emission points out the steadiness
of the source, in particular of the magnetic field configuration and geometry.

Title:Anharmonicity in the mid-infrared spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: Molecular beam spectroscopy and calculations,"
Abstract:  Aims. In this work we determine the effects of anharmonicity on the
mid-infrared spectra of the linear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene and pentacene recorded using the free
electron laser FELIX. Methods. Comparison of experimental spectra obtained
under supersonic jet conditions with theoretically predicted spectra was used
to show if anharmonicity explicitly needs to be taken into account. Results.
Anharmonic spectra obtained using second-order vibrational perturbation theory
agree on average within 0.5% of the experimental frequencies. Importantly, they
confirm the presence of combination bands with appreciable intensity in the 5-6
$\mu$m region. These combination bands contain a significant fraction of the IR
absorption, which scales linearly with the size of the PAH. Detection and
assignment of the combination bands are a preliminary indication of the
accuracy of far-IR modes in our anharmonic theoretical spectra. Detailed
analysis of the periphery-sensitive CH out-of-plane band of naphthalene reveals
that there is still room for improvement of the VPT2 approach. In addition, the
implications of our findings for the analysis of the aromatic infrared bands
are discussed.

Title:The calibration of the first Large-Sized Telescope of the Cherenkov Telescope Array,"
Abstract:  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) represents the next generation of very
high-energy gamma-ray observatory, which will provide broad coverage of gamma
rays from 20 GeV to 300 TeV with unprecedented sensitivity. CTA will employ
three different sizes of telescopes, and the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of
23-m diameter dish will provide the sensitivity in the lowest energies down to
20 GeV. The first LST prototype has been inaugurated in October 2018 at La
Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) and has entered the commissioning phase. The
camera of the LST consists of 265 PMT modules. Each module is equipped with
seven high-quantum-efficiency Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs), a slow control
board, and a readout board. Ensuring high uniformity and precise
characterization of the camera is the key aspects leading to the best
performance and low systematic uncertainty of the LST cameras. Therefore, prior
to the installation on site, we performed a quality check of all PMT modules.
Moreover, the absolute calibration of light throughput is essential to
reconstruct the amount of light received by the telescope. The amount of light
is affected by the atmosphere, by the telescope optical system and camera, and
can be calibrated using the ring-shaped images produced by cosmic-ray muons. In
this contribution, we will show the results of off-site quality control of PMT
modules and on-site calibration using muon rings. We will also highlight the
status of the development of Silicon Photomultiplier modules that could be
considered as a replacement of PMT modules for further improvement of the
camera.

Title:The parallelism between galaxy clusters and early-type galaxies: II. Clues on the origin of the scaling relations,"
Abstract:  Context. This is the second work dedicated to the observed parallelism
between galaxy clusters and early-type galaxies. The focus is on the
distribution of these systems in the scaling relations (SRs) observed when
effective radii, effective surface brightness, total luminosities and velocity
dispersions are mutually correlated. Aims. Using the data of the Illustris
simulation we try to speculate on the origin of the observed SRs. Methods. We
compare the observational SRs extracted from the database of the WIde-field
Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS) with the relevant parameters coming from
the Illustris simulations. Then we use the simulated data at different redshift
to infer the evolution of the SRs. Results. The comparison demonstrate that
galaxy clusters (GCs) at z~0 follow the same log(L)-log(sigma) relation of
early-type galaxies (ETGs) and that both in the log(Ie)-log(Re) and
log(Re)-log(M*) planes the distribution of GCs is along the sequence defined by
the brightest and massive early-type galaxies (BCGs). The Illustris simulation
reproduces the tails of the massive galaxies visible both in the
log(Ie)-log(Re) and log(Re)-log(M*) planes, but fail to give the correct
estimate of the effective radii of the dwarf galaxies that appear too large and
those of GCs that are too small. The evolution of the SRs up to z=4 permits to
reveal the complex evolutionary paths of galaxies in the SRs and indicate that
the line marking the Zone of Exclusion (ZoE), visible both in the
log(Ie)-log(Re) and log(Re)-log(M*) planes, is the trend followed by virialized
and passively evolving systems. Conclusions. We speculate that the observed SRs
originate from the intersection of the virial theorem and a relation L=L_0 x
sigma^beta where the luminosities depend on the star formation history.

Title:Energy-conservation constraints on cosmic string loop production and distribution functions,"
Abstract:  A network of cosmic strings would lead to gravitational waves which may be
detected by pulsar timing or future interferometers. The details of the
gravitational wave signal depend on the distribution of cosmic string loops,
which are produced by intercommutations from the scaling network of long
strings. We analyze the limits imposed by energy conservation, i.e., by the
fact that the total amount of string flowing into loops cannot exceed the
amount leaving the long strings. We show that some recent suggestions for the
cosmic string loop production rate and distribution are ruled out by these
limits. As a result, gravitational waves based on such suggestions, in
particular ""model 3"" used in LIGO data analysis, are not to be expected.

Title:Search for Eccentric Binary Black Hole Mergers with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo during their First and Second Observing Runs,"
Abstract:  When formed through dynamical interactions, stellar-mass binary black holes
may retain eccentric orbits ($e>0.1$ at 10 Hz) detectable by ground-based
gravitational-wave detectors. Eccentricity can therefore be used to
differentiate dynamically-formed binaries from isolated binary black hole
mergers. Current template-based gravitational-wave searches do not use waveform
models associated to eccentric orbits, rendering the search less efficient to
eccentric binary systems. Here we present results of a search for binary black
hole mergers that inspiral in eccentric orbits using data from the first and
second observing runs (O1 and O2) of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. The
search uses minimal assumptions on the morphology of the transient
gravitational waveform. We show that it is sensitive to binary mergers with a
detection range that is weakly dependent on eccentricity for all bound systems.
Our search did not identify any new binary merger candidates. We interpret
these results in light of eccentric binary formation models.

Title:Investigating the Origins of Spiral Structure in Disk Galaxies through a Multiwavelength Study,"
Abstract:  The density-wave theory of spiral structure proposes that star formation
occurs in or near a spiral-shaped region of higher density that rotates rigidly
within the galactic disk at a fixed pattern speed. In most interpretations of
this theory, newborn stars move downstream of this position as they come into
view, forming a downstream spiral which is tighter, with a smaller pitch angle
than that of the density wave itself. Rival theories, including theories which
see spiral arms as essentially transient structures, may demand that pitch
angle should not depend on wavelength. We measure the pitch angle of a large
sample of galaxies at several wavelengths associated with star formation or
very young stars (8.0 {\mu}m, H-{\alpha} line and 151 nm in the far-UV) and
show that they all have the same pitch angle, which is larger than the pitch
angle measured for the same galaxies at optical and near-infrared wavelengths.
Our measurements in the B band and at 3.6 {\mu}m have unambiguously tighter
spirals than the starforming wavelengths. In addition, we have measured in the
u-band, which seems to fall midway between these two extremes. Thus, our
results are consistent with a region of enhanced stellar light situated
downstream of a starforming region.

Title:Galactic Gas Flows from Halo to Disk: Tomography and Kinematics at the Milky Way's Disk-Halo Interface,"
Abstract:  We present a novel absorption line survey using 54 blue horizontal branch
stars (BHBs) in the Milky Way halo as background sources for detecting gas
flows at the disk-halo interface. Distance measurements to high-latitude ($b$ >
60) background stars at 3.1-13.4 kpc, combined with unprecedented spatial
sampling and spectral resolution, allow us to examine the 3-dimensional spatial
distribution and kinematics of gas flows near the disk. We detect absorption
signatures of extraplanar CaII and NaI in Keck HIRES spectra and find that
their column densities exhibit no trend with distance to the background
sources, indicating that these clouds lie within 3.1 kpc of the disk. We
calculate covering fractions of $f_{CaII}$ = 63%, $f_{NaI}$ = 26%, and $f_{HI}$
= 52%, consistent with a picture of the CGM that includes multi-phase clouds
containing small clumps of cool gas within hotter, more diffuse gas. Our
measurements constrain the scale of any substructure within these cool clouds
to <0.5 kpc. CaII and NaI absorption features exhibit an intermediate-velocity
(IV) component inflowing at velocities of -75 km/s < v < -25 km/s relative to
the local standard of rest, consistent with previously-studied HI structures in
this region. We report the new detection of an inflow velocity gradient
${\Delta}v_z$ ~ 6-9 km/s/kpc across the Galactic plane. These findings place
constraints on the physical and kinematic properties of CGM gas flows through
the disk-halo interface, and support a galactic fountain model in which cold
gas rains back onto the disk.

Title:The evolution of CNO isotopes: the impact of massive stellar rotators,"
Abstract:  Chemical abundances and abundance ratios measured in galaxies provide
precious information about the mechanisms, modes and time scales of the
assembly of cosmic structures. Yet, the nucleogenesis and chemical evolution of
elements heavier than helium are dictated mostly by the physics of the stars
and the shape of the stellar mass spectrum. In particular, estimates of CNO
isotopic abundances in the hot, dusty media of high-redshift starburst galaxies
offer a unique glimpse into the shape of the stellar initial mass function
(IMF) in extreme environments that can not be accessed with direct observations
(star counts). Underlying uncertainties in stellar evolution and
nucleosynthesis theory, however, may hurt our chances of getting a firm grasp
of the IMF in these galaxies. In this work, we adopt new yields for massive
stars, covering different initial rotational velocities. First, we implement
the new yield set in a well-tested chemical evolution model for the Milky Way.
The calibrated model is then adapted to the specific case of a prototype
submillimeter galaxy (SMG). We show that, if the formation of fast-rotating
stars is favoured in the turbulent medium of violently star-forming galaxies
irrespective of metallicity, the IMF needs to be skewed towards high-mass stars
in order to explain the CNO isotope ratios observed in SMGs. If, instead,
stellar rotation becomes negligible beyond a given metallicity threshold, as is
the case for our own Galaxy, there is no need to invoke a top-heavy IMF in
starbursts.

rotational lines of the HC$_3$N molecule (cyanoacetylene) in the powerful
outflow/hot molecular core G331.512-0.103. We identified thirty-one rotational
lines at $J$ levels between 24 and 39; seventeen of them in the ground
vibrational state $v$=0 (9 lines corresponding to the main C isotopologue and 8
lines corresponding to the $^{13}$C isotopologues), and fourteen in the lowest
vibrationally excited state $v_7$=1. Using LTE-based population diagrams for
the beam-diluted $v$=0 transitions, we determined $T_{\rm exc}$=85$\pm$4 K and
$N$(HC$_3$N)=(6.9$\pm$0.8)$\times$10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, while for the
beam-diluted $v_7$=1 transitions we obtained $T_{\rm exc}$=89$\pm$10 K and
$N$(HC$_3$N)=2$\pm$1$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. Non-LTE calculations using
H$_2$ collision rates indicate that the HC$_3$N emission is in good agreement
with LTE-based results. From the non-LTE method we estimated $T_{\rm kin}$
$\simeq$90~K, $n$(H$_2$)$\simeq$2$\times$10$^7$~cm$^{-3}$ for a central core of
6 arcsec in size. A vibrational temperature in the range from 130~K to 145~K
was also determined, values which are very likely lower limits. Our results
suggest that rotational transitions are thermalized, while IR radiative pumping
processes are probably more efficient than collisions in exciting the molecule
to the vibrationally excited state $v_7$=1. Abundance ratios derived under LTE
conditions for the $^{13}$C isotopologues suggest that the main formation
pathway of HC$_3$N is ${\rm C}_2{\rm H}_2 + {\rm CN} \rightarrow {\rm HC}_3{\rm
N} + {\rm H}$.

state-of-the-art ways to constrain its properties, including taking advantage
of the now-ubiquitous all-sky catalog photometry and Gaia parallaxes. EXOFASTv2

self-consistently with the same underlying stellar mass that defines their
semi-major axes through Kepler's law and the planetary period. Transit timing,
duration, and depth variations can be modeled with a simple command line
option.
We explain our methodology and rationale as well as provide an improved
version of the core transit model that is both 25\% faster and more accurate.
We highlight several potential pitfalls in exoplanet modeling, including the
handling of eccentricity in transit-only fits, that the standard exoplanet
convention for $\omega$ uses a left-handed coordinate system, contrary to most
modern textbooks, how to avoid an important degeneracy when allowing negative
companion masses, and a widely unappreciated, potential 10-minute ambiguity in
the reported transit times.
EXOFASTv2 is available at this https URL . The code is
written in IDL, and includes an executable that can be run freely and legally
without an IDL license or any knowledge of the language. Extensive
documentation and tutorials are included in the distribution for a variety of

sophisticated global fits of complex planetary systems with EXOFASTv2. It is
therefore a powerful tool for education and outreach as well as the broader

Abstract:  We introduce the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopy Survey (${S}^5$), an
on-going program to map the kinematics and chemistry of stellar streams in the
Southern Hemisphere. The initial focus of ${S}^5$ has been spectroscopic
observations of recently identified streams within the footprint of the Dark
Energy Survey (DES), with the eventual goal of surveying streams across the
entire southern sky. Stellar streams are composed of material that has been
tidally striped from dwarf galaxies and globular clusters and hence are
excellent dynamical probes of the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, as
well as providing a detailed snapshot of its accretion history. Observing with
the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope's 2-degree-Field fibre positioner and
AAOmega spectrograph, and combining the precise photometry of DES DR1 with the
superb proper motions from $Gaia$ DR2, allows us to conduct an efficient
spectroscopic survey to map these stellar streams. So far ${S}^5$ has mapped 9
DES streams and 3 streams outside of DES; the former are the first
spectroscopic observations of these recently discovered streams. In addition to
the stream survey, we use spare fibres to undertake a Milky Way halo survey and
a low-redshift galaxy survey. This paper presents an overview of the ${S}^5$
program, describing the scientific motivation for the survey, target selection,
observation strategy, data reduction and survey validation. Finally, we
describe early science results on stellar streams and Milky Way halo stars
drawn from the survey. Updates on ${S}^5$, including future public data

Title:Fossil group origins X. Velocity segregation in fossil systems,"
Abstract:  We want to study how the velocity segregation and the radial profile of the
velocity dispersion depend on the prominence of the brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs). We divide a sample of 102 clusters and groups of galaxies into four
bins of magnitude gap between the two brightest cluster members. We then
compute the velocity segregation in bins of absolute and relative magnitudes.
Moreover, for each bin of magnitude gap we compute the radial profile of the
velocity dispersion. When using absolute magnitudes, the segregation in
velocity is limited to the two brightest bins and no significant difference is
found for different magnitude gaps. However, when we use relative magnitudes, a
trend appears in the brightest bin: the larger the magnitude gap, the larger
the velocity segregation. We also show that this trend is mainly due to the
presence, in the brightest bin, of satellite galaxies in systems with small
magnitude gaps: in fact, if we study separately central galaxies and
satellites, this trend is mitigated and central galaxies are more segregated
than satellites for any magnitude gap. A similar result is found in the radial
velocity dispersion profiles: a trend is visible in central regions (where the
BCGs dominate) but, if we analyse the profile using satellites alone, the trend
disappears. In the latter case, the shape of the velocity dispersion profile in
the centre of systems with different magnitude gaps show three types of
behaviours: systems with the smallest magnitude gaps have an almost flat
profile from the centre to the external regions; systems with the largest
magnitude gaps show a monothonical growth from the low values of the central
part to the flat ones in the external regions; finally, systems with $1.0 <
\Delta m_{12} \le 1.5$ show a profile that peaks in the centres and then
decreases towards the external regions. We suggest that two mechanisms could be

Title:Limit on the LMC mass from a census of its satellites,"
Abstract:  We study the orbits of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies in the combined presence of
the Milky Way and LMC and we find 6 dwarfs which were likely accreted with the
LMC (Car 2, Car 3, Hor 1, Hyi 1, Phe 2, Ret 2), in addition to the SMC,
representing strong evidence of dwarf galaxy group infall. This procedure
depends on the gravitational pull of the LMC, thus allowing us to place a lower
bound on the Cloud's mass of $M_{\rm LMC} > 1.24\times10^{11} M_\odot$. This
mass estimate is validated by applying the technique to a cosmological zoom-in
simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with an LMC analogue where we find that
while this lower bound may be overestimated, it will improve in the future with
smaller observational errors. We apply this technique to dwarf galaxies lacking
radial velocities and find that Eri 3 has a broad range of radial velocities
for which it has a significant chance ($> 0.4$) of having being bound to the
Cloud. We study the non-Magellanic classical satellites and find that Fornax
has an appreciable probability of being an LMC satellite if the LMC is
sufficiently massive. In addition, we explore how the orbits of the Milky Way

several objects. Finally, we find that the LMC satellites are slightly smaller

Title:Pseudo-Evolution of Galaxies in LCDM Cosmology,"
Abstract:  Our knowledge about galaxy evolution comes from transforming observed galaxy
properties at different redshifts to co-moving physical scales. This
transformation depends on using a cosmological model. Here the effects of
unintentional mixing of two different cosmological models on the size evolution
of galaxies is studied. As a gedanken experiment, a galaxy of fixed proper size
and luminosity is moved across different redshifts. The apparent size of this
galaxy is then interpreted with a cosmological model presumed by the observer,
which is different compared to the cosmology exhibited by the Universe. In such
a case, a spurious size evolution of the galaxy is observed. A galaxy behaving
according to the R_h=ct and Neumann's cosmology, when interpreted with the LCDM
cosmological model, shows an increase in size by a factor of 1.1 and 1.3 from
z=7.5 to z approx. 0, respectively. The apparent size of a galaxy in a static
Euclidean cosmology, when interpreted in the LCDM model, shows a factor of 23.8
increase in size between z=7.5 to z approx. 0. This is in close agreement with
the observational data with a size increase of a factor of 6.8 between z=3.2 to
z approx. 0. Furthermore, using the apparent size data, it is shown that the
difference between the derived proper sizes in R_h=ct, Neumann's and LCDM
cosmological models are minimal.

Title:Barycentric interpolation on Riemannian and semi-Riemannian spaces,"
Abstract:  Interpolation of data represented in curvilinear coordinates and possibly
having some non-trivial, typically Riemannian or semi-Riemannian geometry is an
ubiquitous task in all of physics. In this work we present a covariant
generalization of the barycentric coordinates and the barycentric interpolation
method for Riemannian and semi-Riemannian spaces of arbitrary dimension. We
show that our new method preserves the linear accuracy property of barycentric
interpolation in a coordinate-invariant sense. In addition, we show how the
method can be used to interpolate constrained quantities so that the given
constraint is automatically respected. We showcase the method with two
astrophysics related examples situated in the curved Kerr spacetime. The first
problem is interpolating a locally constant vector field, in which case
curvature effects are expected to be maximally important. The second example is
a General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics simulation of a turbulent accretion
flow around a black hole, wherein high intrinsic variability is expected to be
at least as important as curvature effects.

Title:Proper Motions of Stellar Streams Discovered in the Dark Energy Survey,"
Abstract:  We cross-match high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR2 with accurate
multi-band photometry from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) DR1 to confidently
measure proper motions for nine stellar streams in the DES footprint: Aliqa
Uma, ATLAS, Chenab, Elqui, Indus, Jhelum, Phoenix, Tucana III, and Turranburra.
We determine low-confidence proper motion measurements for four additional
stellar streams: Ravi, Wambelong, Willka Yaku, and Turbio. We find evidence for
a misalignment between stream tracks and the systemic proper motion of streams
that may suggest a systematic gravitational influence from the Large Magellanic
Cloud. These proper motions, when combined with radial velocity measurements,
will allow for detailed orbit modeling which can be used to constrain
properties of the LMC and its affect on nearby streams, as well as global
properties of the Milky Way's gravitational potential.

Title:Free-form Grale reconstruction of Abell 2744: robustness of uncertainties against changes in lensing data,"
Abstract:  Abell 2744, a massive Hubble Frontier Fields merging galaxy cluster with many
multiple images in the core has been the subject of many lens inversions using
different methods. While most existing studies compare various inversion
methods, we focus on a comparison of reconstructions that use different input
lensing data. Since the quantity and quality of lensing data is constantly
improving, it makes sense to ask if the estimated uncertainties are robust
against changes in the data. We address this question using free-form Grale,
which takes only image information as input, and nothing pertaining to cluster
galaxies. We reconstruct Abell 2744 using two sets of strong lensing data from
the Hubble Frontier Fields community. Our first and second reconstructions use
55 and 91 images, respectively, and only 10 of the 91 images have the same
positions and redshifts as in the first reconstruction. Comparison of the two
mass maps shows that Grale uncertainties are robust against these changes, as
well as small modifications in the inversion routine. Additionally, applying
the methods used in Sebesta et al. (2016) for MACS J0416, we conclude that, in
a statistical sense, light follows mass in Abell 2744, with brighter galaxies
clustering stronger with the recovered mass than the fainter ones. We also show
that the faintest galaxies are anti-correlated with mass, which is likely the
result of light contamination from bright galaxies, and lensing magnification
bias acting on galaxies background to the cluster.

Title:The BAHAMAS project: Effects of a running scalar spectral index on large-scale structure,"
Abstract:  Recent analyses of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the Lyman-alpha
forest indicate a mild preference for a deviation from a power law primordial
matter power spectrum (a so-called negative `running'). We use an extension to
the BAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to explore the
effects that a running scalar spectral index has on large-scale structure
(LSS), using Planck CMB constraints to initialize the simulations. We focus on
5 key statistics: i) the non-linear matter power spectrum ii) the halo mass
function; iii) the halo two-point auto correlation function; iv) total mass
halo density profiles; and v) the halo concentration-mass relation. In terms of
the matter power spectrum, we find that a running scalar spectral index affects
all k-scales examined in this study, with a negative (positive) running leading
to an amplification (suppression) of power. These effects should be easily
detectable with upcoming surveys such as LSST and Euclid. In the mass range
sampled, a positive running leads to an increase in the mass of galaxy groups
and clusters, with the favoured negative running leading to a decrease in mass
of lower-mass (M <~ 10^13 M_solar) halos, but an increase for the most massive
(M >~ 10^13 M_solar) halos. Changes in the mass are generally confined to 5-10%
which, while not insignificant, cannot by itself reconcile the claimed tension
between the primary CMB and cluster number counts. We find that running does
not significantly affect the shapes of density profiles of matched halos,
changing only their amplitude. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed
effects on LSS due to a running scalar spectral index are separable from those
of baryonic effects to typically a few percent precision.

Title:deepCR: Cosmic Ray Rejection with Deep Learning,"
Abstract:  Cosmic ray (CR) identification and replacement are critical components of
imaging and spectroscopic reduction pipelines involving solid-state detectors.
We present deepCR, a deep learning based framework for CR identification and
subsequent image inpainting based on the predicted CR mask. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of this framework, we train and evaluate models on Hubble Space
Telescope ACS/WFC images of sparse extragalactic fields, globular clusters, and
resolved galaxies. We demonstrate that at a false positive rate of 0.5%, deepCR
achieves close to 100% detection rates in both extragalactic and globular
cluster fields, and 91% in resolved galaxy fields, which is a significant
improvement over the current state-of-the-art method LACosmic. Compared to a
multicore CPU implementation of LACosmic, deepCR CR mask predictions run up to
6.5 times faster on CPU and 90 times faster on a single GPU. For image
inpainting, the mean squared errors of deepCR predictions are 20 times lower in
globular cluster fields, 5 times lower in resolved galaxy fields, and 2.5 times
lower in extragalactic fields, compared to the best performing non-neural
technique tested. We present our framework and the trained models as an
open-source Python project, with a simple-to-use API. To facilitate
reproducibility of the results we also provide a benchmarking codebase.

Abstract:  We conducted an observation of the nearby irregular galaxy IC 1613 with the
Chandra X-ray Observatory using the S3 chip of the ACIS with an effective
exposure time of 49.9 ksec. The observation primarily targeted the extensive
bubble and star formation region in the northeast quadrant of the galaxy. The
only known supernova remnant (SNR) in IC 1613, S8, is also the galaxy's most
luminous X-ray source (L_X (0.3-8 keV) ~5-6x10^{36} erg/s). We resolve the SNR
with Chandra and compare its nearly circular X-ray morphology with Halpha and
radio images. We assign an upper limit on the luminosity of any possible
associated compact central object of ~4x10^{35}$ erg/s (0.3-8 keV band) and
conclude that we would detect a Crab-like pulsar but not a Cas A-like object.
We infer an age for S8 of ~3400-5600 years and compare it to other SNRs in the
Local Group. We suggest that S8 is a young composite SNR.

Title:Flattened stellar systems based on distribution functions depending on actions,"
Abstract:  We address an issue that arises when self-consistently flattened dynamical
stellar systems are constructed by adopting a distribution function (DF) that
depends on the action integrals. The velocity distribution at points on the
symmetry axis is controlled by the the dependence of the DF on just one action,
while at points off the symmetry axis two actions are involved. Consequently,
the physical requirement that the velocity distribution evolves continuously in
the neighbourhood of the symmetry axis restricts the functional forms of
acceptable DFs. An algorithm for conforming to this restriction is presented
and used to construct a variety of flattened models.

Abstract:  Motivated by the stability of dust laden vortices, in this paper we study the
terminal velocity approximation equations for a gas coupled to a pressureless
dust fluid and present a numerical solver for the equations embedded in the
FARGO3D hydrodynamics code. We show that for protoplanetary discs it is
possible to use the baricenter velocity in the viscous stress tensor, making it
trivial to simulate viscous dusty protoplanetary discs with this model. We also
show that the terminal velocity model breaks down around shocks, becoming
incompatible with the two fluid model it is derived from. Finally we produce a
set of test cases for numerical schemes and demonstrate the performance of our
code on these tests. Our implementation embedded in FARGO3D using an
unconditionally stable explicit integrator is fast, and exhibits the desired
second order spatial convergence for smooth problems.

Abstract:  New images of young stars are revolutionizing our understanding of planet
formation. ALMA detects large grains in planet-forming disks with few AU scale
resolution and scattered light imaging with extreme adaptive optics systems
reveal small grains suspended on the disks' flared surfaces. Tantalizing
evidence for young exoplanets is emerging from line observations of CO and
H-alpha. In this white paper, we explore how even higher angular resolution can
extend our understanding of the key stages of planet formation, to resolve
accreting circumplanetary disks themselves, and to watch planets forming in
situ for the nearest star-forming regions. We focus on infrared observations
which are sensitive to thermal emission in the terrestrial planet formation
zone and allow access to molecular tracers in warm ro-vibrational states.
Successful planet formation theories will not only be able to explain the
diverse features seen in disks, but will also be consistent with the rich
exoplanet demographics from RV and transit surveys. While we are far from
exhausting ground-based techniques, the ultimate combination of high angular
resolution and high infrared sensitivity can only be achieved through
mid-infrared space interferometry.

Title:Horizontal branch morphology: A new photometric parametrization,"
Abstract:  Theory and observations indicate that the distribution of stars along the
horizontal branch of Galactic globular clusters mainly depends on the metal
content. However, the existence of globular clusters with similar metal content
and absolute age but different horizontal branch morphologies, suggests the
presence of another parameter affecting the star distribution along the branch.
To investigate the variation of the horizontal branch morphology in Galactic
globular clusters, we define a new photometric horizontal branch morphology
index, overcoming some of the limitations and degeneracies affecting similar
indices available in the literature. We took advantage of a sample of 64
Galactic globular clusters, with both space-based imaging data and homogeneous
ground-based photometric catalogues in five different bands ($U$,$B$,$V$, $R$,
$I$). The new index, $\tau_{HB}$, is defined as the ratio between the areas
subtended by the cumulative number distribution in magnitude ($I$) and in
colour ($V-I$) of all stars along the horizontal branch. This new index shows a
linear trend over the entire range in metallicity (-2.35 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$
-0.12) covered by our Galactic globular cluster sample. We found a linear
relation between $\tau_{HB}$ and absolute cluster ages. We also found a
quadratic anti-correlation with [Fe/H], becoming linear when we eliminate the
age effect on $\tau_{HB}$ values. Moreover, we identified a subsample of eight
clusters that are peculiar according to their $\tau_{HB}$ values. These
clusters have bluer horizontal branch morphology when compared to typical ones
of similar metallicity. These findings allow us to define them as the 'second
parameter' clusters in the sample. A comparison with synthetic horizontal
branch models suggests that they cannot be entirely explained with a spread in
helium content.

molecules from the atmospheres of nearby exo-Earths. With no practical
engineering limit to the formation's size or number of telescopes in the array,
formation flying interferometry will revolutionize astronomy and this White
Paper makes the case that it is now time to accelerate investments in this

degrees surveyed with the SPTpol receiver on the South Pole Telescope. The
catalog contains 89 candidates detected with a signal-to-noise ratio greater
than 4.6. The candidates are selected using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect at 95
and 150 GHz. Using both space- and ground-based optical and infrared
telescopes, we have confirmed 81 candidates as galaxy clusters. We use these
follow-up images and archival images to estimate photometric redshifts for 66
galaxy clusters and spectroscopic observations to obtain redshifts for 13
systems. An additional 2 galaxy clusters are confirmed using the overdensity of
near-infrared galaxies only, and are presented without redshifts. We find that
15 candidates (18% of the total sample) are at redshift of $z \geq 1.0$, with a
maximum confirmed redshift of $z_{\rm{max}} = 1.38 \pm 0.10$. We expect this
catalog to contain every galaxy cluster with $M_{500c} > 2.6 \times 10^{14}
M_\odot h^{-1}_{70}$ and $z > 0.25$ in the survey area. The mass threshold is
approximately constant above $z = 0.25$, and the complete catalog has a median
mass of approximately $ M_{500c} = 2.7 \times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}_{70}$.
Compared to previous SPT works, the increased depth of the millimeter-wave data
(11.2 and 6.5 $\mu$K-arcmin at 95 and 150 GHz, respectively) makes it possible
to find more galaxy clusters at high redshift and lower mass.

"Title:MOCMC: Method of Characteristics Moment Closure, a Numerical Method for Covariant Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics","
Abstract:  We present a conservative numerical method for radiation magnetohydrodynamics
with frequency-dependent full transport in stationary spacetimes. This method
is stable and accurate for both large and small optical depths and radiation
pressures. The radiation stress-energy tensor is evolved in flux-conservative
form, and closed with a swarm of samples that each transport a multigroup
representation of the invariant specific intensity along a null geodesic. In
each zone, the enclosed samples are used to efficiently construct a Delaunay
triangulation of the unit sphere in the comoving frame, which in turn is used
to calculate the Eddington tensor, average source terms, and adaptively refine
the sample swarm. Radiation four-fources are evaluated in the moment sector in
a semi-implicit fashion. The radiative transfer equation is solved in invariant
form deterministically for each sample. Since each sample carries a discrete
representation of the full spectrum, the cost of evaluating the transport
operator is independent of the number of frequency groups, representing a
significant reduction of algorithmic complexity for transport in frequency
dependent problems. The major approximation we make in this work is performing
scattering in an angle-averaged way, with Compton scattering further
approximated by the Kompaneets equation. Local adaptivity in samples also makes
this scheme more amenable to nonuniform meshes than a traditional Monte Carlo
method. We describe the method and present results on a suite of test problems.
We find that MOCMC converges at least as $\sim N^{-1}$, rather than the
canonical Monte Carlo $N^{-1/2}$, where $N$ is the number of samples per zone.
On several problems we demonstrate substantial improvement over Eddington and
M1 closures and gray opacities.

Title:On the nature of the resonant drag instability of dust streaming in protoplanetary disc,"
Abstract:  The recently discovered resonant drag instability (RDI) of dust streaming in
protoplanetary disc is considered as the mode coupling of subsonic gas-dust
mixture perturbations. This mode coupling is coalescence of two modes with
nearly equal phase velocities: inertial wave (IW) having positive energy and a
streaming dust wave (SDW) having negative energy as measured in the frame of
gas environment being at rest in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. SDW is a
trivial mode produced by the bulk streaming of dust, which transports
perturbations of dust density. In this way, settling combined with radial drift
of the dust makes possible coupling of SDW with IW and the onset of the
instability. In accordance with the concept of the mode coupling, RDI growth
rate is proportional to the square root of the coupling term of the dispersion
equation, which itself is proportional to mass fraction of dust, $f\ll 1$. This
clarifies why RDI growth rate $\propto f^{1/2}$. When SDW has positive energy,
its resonance with IW provides an avoided crossing instead of the mode
coupling. In the high wavenumber limit RDI with unbounded growth rate $\propto
f^{1/3}$ is explained by the triple mode coupling, which is coupling of SDW
with two IW. It coexists with a new quasi-resonant instability accompanied by
bonding of two oppositely propagating low-frequency IW. The mode coupling does
not exist for dust streaming only radially in a disc. In this case RDI is
provided by the obscured mechanism associated with the inertia of solids.

Abstract:  Interstellar neutral gas atoms penetrate the heliopause and reach 1~au, where
they are detected by IBEX. The flow of neutral interstellar helium through the
perturbed interstellar plasma in the outer heliosheath (OHS) results in
creation of the secondary population of interstellar He atoms, the so-called
Warm Breeze, due to charge exchange with perturbed ions. The secondary
population brings the imprint of the OHS conditions to the IBEX-Lo instrument.
Based on a global simulation of the heliosphere with measurement-based
parameters and detailed kinetic simulation of the filtration of He in the OHS,
we find the number density of interstellar He$^+$ population at $(8.98\pm
0.12)\times 10^{-3}$~cm$^{-3}$. With this, we obtain the absolute density of
interstellar H$^+$ $5.4\times 10^{-2}$~cm$^{-3}$ and electrons $6.3\times
10^{-2}$~cm$^{-3}$, and ionization degrees of H 0.26 and He 0.37. The results
agree with estimates of the Very Local Interstellar Matter parameters obtained
from fitting the observed spectra of diffuse interstellar EUV and soft X-Ray
background.

Title:Fast Radio Burst dispersion measures and rotation measures and the origin of intergalactic magnetic fields,"
Abstract:  We investigate the possibility of measuring intergalactic magnetic fields
using the dispersion measures and rotation measures of fast radio bursts. With
Bayesian methods, we produce probability density functions for values of these
measures. We distinguish between contributions from the intergalactic medium,
the host galaxy and the local environment of the progenitor. To this end, we
use constrained, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the local Universe to
compute lines-of-sight integrals from the position of the Milky Way. In
particular, we differentiate between predominantly astrophysical and primordial
origins of magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium. We test different
possible types of host galaxies and probe different distribution functions of
fast radio burst progenitor locations inside the host galaxy. Under the
assumption that fast radio bursts are produced by magnetars, we use analytic
predictions to account for the contribution of the local environment. We find
that less than 100 fast radio bursts from magnetars in stellar-wind
environments hosted by starburst dwarf galaxies at redshift $z \gtrsim 0.5$
suffice to discriminate between predominantly primordial and astrophysical
origins of intergalactic magnetic fields. However, this requires the
contribution of the Milky Way to be removed with a precision of $\approx 1
\rm~rad~m^{-2}$. We show the potential existence of a subset of fast radio
bursts whose rotation measure carry information on the strength of the
intergalactic magnetic field and its origins.

"Title:Long-term variations of Venus' 365-nm albedo observed by Venus Express, Akatsuki, MESSENGER, and Hubble Space Telescope","
Abstract:  An unknown absorber near the cloud top level of Venus generates a broad
absorption feature from the ultraviolet (UV) to visible, peaking around 360 nm,
and therefore plays a critical role in the solar energy absorption. We present
a quantitative study on the variability of the cloud albedo at 365 nm and its
impact on Venus' solar heating rates based on an analysis of Venus Express and
Akatsuki's UV images, and Hubble Space Telescope and MESSENGER's UV spectral
data; in this analysis the calibration correction factor of the UV images of
Venus Express (VMC) is updated relative to the Hubble and MESSENGER albedo
measurements. Our results indicate that the 365-nm albedo varied by a factor of
2 from 2006 to 2017 over the entire planet, producing a 25-40% change in the
low latitude solar heating rate according to our radiative transfer
calculations. Thus, the cloud top level atmosphere should have experienced
considerable solar heating variations over this period. Our global circulation
model calculations show that this variable solar heating rate may explain the
observed variations of zonal wind from 2006 to 2017. Overlaps in the timescale
of the long-term UV albedo and the solar activity variations make it plausible
that solar extreme UV intensity and cosmic-ray variations influenced the
observed albedo trends. The albedo variations might also be linked with
temporal variations of the upper cloud SO2 gas abundance, which affects the
H2SO4-H2O aerosol formation.

Title:Observations meets theory in clustered star formation,"
Abstract:  Stars form predominantly in groups which display a broad spectrum of masses,
sizes, and other properties. Despite this diversity there exist an underlying
structure that can constrain cluster formation theories. We show how combining
observations with simulations allows to disclose this underlying structure. One
example is the mass-radius relation for young embedded associations which
follows $M_c = CR_c^\gamma$ with $\gamma$ = 1.7 $\pm$0.2, which is directly
related to the mass-radius relation of clumps. Results based on GAIA 2D have
demonstrated that young stellar groups (1--5 Myr) expand and that this
expansion process is largely over by an age of 10-20 Myr. Such a behaviour is
expected within the gas expulsion scenario. However, the effect of gas
expulsion depends strongly on a the SFE, the gas expulsion time scale, etc.
Here it is demonstrated how existing and upcoming data are able to constrain
these parameters and correspondingly the underlying models.

around the same epoch in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and white-light show that
the above burst was associated with a flux rope structure and a coronal mass
ejection (CME), respectively. The combined height-time plot generated using
EUV, radio, and whitelight data suggest that the different observed features

constructed an empirical model for the coronal electron density distribution
($N_{e}(r)$, where $r$ is the heliocentric distance) from the above set of
observations themselves and used it to estimate the coronal magnetic field
strength ($B$) over the range of $r$ values in which the respective events were

$B(r)\,=\,2.61 \times r^{-2.21}$ \textrm{G} in the range $r

been reported. Further, the present work is a novel attempt where the
characteristics of a propagating EUV flux rope structure, considered to be the
signature of a CME close the Sun, have been used to estimate $B(r)$ in the

Abstract:  Extragalactic dispersion measures (DMs) obtained from observations of fast
radio bursts (FRBs) are an excellent tool for probing intergalactic medium
(IGM) and for conducting cosmography. However, the DM contribution from the IGM
(${\rm DM_{IGM}}$) depends on the fraction of baryon mass in the IGM, $f_{\rm
IGM}$, which is not properly constrained. As $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$ is geometrically
related to the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and ${\rm DM_{IGM}}(z)$, here we propose
that combining two independent measurements of FRBs and $H(z)$ in similar
redshift ranges provides a novel and cosmology-free method to constrain the
evolution of $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$. Under the assumption that $f_{\rm IGM}$ is
evolving with redshift in a functional form, we forecast that the evolution of
$f_{\rm IGM}(z)$ can be well inferred in a combined analysis of $\sim3000$
${\rm DM_{IGM}}(z)$ derived from FRBs and $\sim50$ $H(z)$ derived from the
Hubble parameter data. Though the efficiency of our method is not as good as
that of the other model-independent method involving the joint measurements of
DM and luminosity distance of FRBs, our method offers a new model-independent
way to constrain $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$.

Title:Multicolour photometry for exoplanet candidate validation,"
Abstract:  Context. The TESS and PLATO missions are expected to find vast numbers of new
transiting planet candidates. However, only a fraction of these candidates will
be legitimate planets, and the candidate validation will require a significant
amount of follow-up resources. Radial velocity follow-up can be carried out
only for the most promising candidates around bright, slowly rotating, stars.
Thus, before devoting RV resources to candidates, they need to be vetted using
cheaper methods, and, in the cases for which an RV confirmation is not
feasible, the candidate's true nature needs to be determined based on these
alternative methods alone.
Aims. We study the applicability of multicolour transit photometry in the
validation of transiting planet candidates when the candidate signal arises
from a real astrophysical source. We seek to answer how securely can we
estimate the true uncontaminated star-planet radius ratio when the light curve
may contain contamination from unresolved light sources inside the photometry
aperture when combining multicolour transit observations with a physics-based
contamination model.
Methods. The study is based on simulations and ground-based transit
observations. The analyses are carried out with a contamination model
integrated into the PyTransit v2 transit modelling package, and the
observations are carried out with the MuSCAT2 multicolour imager installed in
the 1.5 m TCS in the Teide Observatory.
Results. We show that multicolour transit photometry can be used to estimate
the amount of flux contamination and the true radius ratio. Combining the true
radius ratio with an estimate for the stellar radius yields the true absolute
radius of the transiting object, which is a valuable quantity in statistical
candidate validation, and enough in itself to validate a candidate whose radius
falls below the theoretical lower limit for a brown dwarf.

Title:Genetic Algorithms for Starshade Retargeting in Space-Based Telescopes,"
Abstract:  Future space-based telescopes will leverage starshades as components that can
be independently positioned. Starshades will adjust the light coming in from
exoplanet host stars and enhance the direct imaging of exoplanets and other
phenomena. In this context, scheduling of space-based telescope observations is
subject to a large number of dynamic constraints, including target
observability, fuel, and target priorities. We present an application of
genetic algorithm (GA) scheduling on this problem that not only takes physical
constraints into account, but also considers direct human suggestions on
schedules. By allowing direct suggestions on schedules, this type of heuristic
can capture the scheduling preferences and expertise of stakeholders without
the need to always formally codify such objectives. Additionally, this approach
allows schedules to be constructed from existing ones when scenarios change;
for example, this capability allows for optimization without the need to
recompute schedules from scratch after changes such as new discoveries or new
targets of opportunity. We developed a specific graph-traversal-based framework
upon which to apply GA for telescope scheduling, and use it to demonstrate the
convergence behavior of a particular implementation of GA. From this work,
difficulties with regards to assigning values to observational targets are also
noted, and recommendations are made for different scenarios.

Title:A galaxy classification grid that better recognises early-type galaxy morphology,"
Abstract:  A modified galaxy classification scheme for local galaxies is presented. It
builds upon the Aitken-Jeans nebula sequence, by expanding the Jeans-Hubble
tuning fork diagram, which itself contained key ingredients from Curtis and
Reynolds. The two-dimensional grid of galaxy morphological types presented
here, with elements from de Vaucouleurs' three-dimensional classification
volume, has an increased emphasis on the often overlooked bars and continua of
disc sizes in early-type galaxies - features not fully captured by past tuning
forks, tridents, or combs. The grid encompasses nuclear discs in elliptical (E)
galaxies, intermediate-scale discs in ellicular (ES) galaxies, and large-scale
discs in lenticular (S0) galaxies, while the E4-E7 class is made redundant
given that these galaxies are lenticular galaxies. Today, these disc structures
continue to be neglected, or surprise researchers, perhaps partly due to our
indoctrination to galaxy morphology through the tuning fork diagram. To better
understand the past and present classification schemes - whose origins reside
in solar/planetary formation models - a holistic overview is given. This
provides due credit to some of the lesser known pioneers, presents some
rationale for the grid, and reveals the incremental nature of, and some of the
lesser known connections in, the field of galaxy morphology.

Title:Orbital Evolution of a Circumbinary Planet in a Gaseous Disk,"
Abstract:  Sub-Jupiter classed circumbinary planets discovered in close-in binary
systems have orbits just beyond the dynamically unstable region, which is
determined by the eccentricity and mass ratio of the host binary stars. These
planets are assumed to have formed beyond the snow line and migrated to the
current orbits rather than forming in situ. We propose a scenario in which a
planet formed beyond the snow line and migrated to the inner edge of the
circumbinary disk, which was within the unstable area, and then moved to the
current orbit through outward transportation. This outward transportation is
driven by the balance of orbital excitation of the central stars inside the
gravitationally unstable region and damping by the gas-drag force. We carried
out N-body simulations with a dissipating circumbinary protoplanetary disk for
binary systems with different eccentricities and mass ratios. Planets are more
likely to achieve a stable orbit just beyond the unstable region in less
eccentric binary systems. This result is not as sensitive to mass ratio as it
is to eccentricity. These dependencies are consistent with the data from
observed binary systems hosting circumbinary planets. We find CBPs' orbits
close to the instability boundaries are explained by our orbital evolution
scenario.

Title:Bifurcation in the history of Uranus and Neptune: the role of giant impacts,"
Abstract:  Despite many similarities, there are significant observed differences between
Uranus and Neptune: while Uranus is tilted and has a regular set of satellites,
suggesting their accretion from a disk, Neptune's moons are irregular and are
captured objects. In addition, Neptune seems to have an internal heat source,
while Uranus is in equilibrium with solar insulation. Finally, structure models
based on gravity data suggest that Uranus is more centrally condensed than
Neptune. We perform a large suite of high resolution SPH simulations to
investigate whether these differences can be explained by giant impacts. For
Uranus, we find that an oblique impact can tilt its spin axis and eject enough
material to create a disk where the regular satellites are formed. Some of the
disks are massive and extended enough, and consist of enough rocky material to
explain the formation of Uranus' regular satellites. For Neptune, we
investigate whether a head-on collision could mix the interior, and lead to an
adiabatic temperature profile, which may explain its larger flux and higher
moment of inertia value. We find that massive and dense projectiles can
penetrate towards the centre and deposit mass and energy in the deep interior,
leading to a less centrally concentrated interior for Neptune. We conclude that
the dichotomy between the ice giants can be explained by violent impacts after
their formation.

Title:Formation imprints in the kinematics of the Milky Way globular cluster system,"
Abstract:  We report results on the kinematics of Milky Way (MW) globular clusters (GCs)
based on updated space velocities for nearly the entire GC population. We found
that a 3D space with the semi-major axis, the eccentricity and the inclination
of the orbit with respect to the MW plane as its axes is helpful in order to
dig into the formation of the GC system. We find that GCs formed in-situ show a
clear correlation between their eccentricities and their orbital inclination in
the sense that clusters with large eccentricities also have large inclinations.
These GCs also show a correlation between their distance to the MW center and
their eccentricity. Accreted GCs do not exhibit a relationship between
eccentricity and inclination, but span a wide variety of inclinations at
eccentricities larger than ~ 0.5. Finally, we computed the velocity anisotropy
""beta"" of the GC system and found for GCs formed in-situ that ""beta"" decreases
from ~ 0.8 down to 0.3 from the outermost regions towards the MW center, but
remains fairly constant (0.7-0.9) for accreted ones. These findings can be
explained if GCs formed from gas that collapsed radially in the outskirts, with
preference for relative high infall angles. As the material reached the
rotating forming disk, it became more circular and moved with lower inclination
relative to the disk. A half of the GC population was accreted and deposited in
orbits covering the entire range of energies from the outer halo to the bulge.

Title:Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer,"
Abstract:  The theory and numerical modelling of radiation processes and radiative
transfer play a key role in astrophysics: they provide the link between the
physical properties of an object and the radiation it emits. In the modern era
of increasingly high-quality observational data and sophisticated physical
theories, development and exploitation of a variety of approaches to the
modelling of radiative transfer is needed. In this article, we focus on one
remarkably versatile approach: Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT). We
describe the principles behind this approach, and highlight the relative ease
with which they can (and have) been implemented for application to a range of
astrophysical problems. All MCRT methods have in common a need to consider the
adverse consequences of Monte Carlo noise in simulation results. We overview a
range of methods used to suppress this noise and comment on their relative
merits for a variety of applications. We conclude with a brief review of
specific applications for which MCRT methods are currently popular and comment
on the prospects for future developments.

Title:Measuring Bias via the Consistency Relations of the Large Scale Structure,"
Abstract:  Consistency Relations (CR) for the Large Scale Structure are exact equalities
between correlation functions of different order. These relations descend from
the equivalence principle and hold for primordial perturbations generated by
single-field models of inflation. They are not affected by nonlinearities and
hold also for biased tracers and in redshift space. We show that Baryonic
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the bispectrum (BS) in the squeezed limit are
suppressed with respect to those in the power spectrum (PS) by a coefficient
that depends on the BS configuration and on the bias parameter (and, in
redshift space, also on the growth rate). We test these relations using large
volume N-body simulations and show that they provide a novel way to measure
large scale halo bias and, potentially, the growth rate. Since bias is obtained
by comparing two directly observable quantities, the method is free from
theoretical uncertainties both on the computational scheme and on the
underlying cosmological model.

Title:Enhanced HI profile asymmetries in close galaxy pairs,"
Abstract:  Analysing the quantified HI profile asymmetries of galaxies in different
environments, we explore not only the prevalence of asymmetry in HI profiles,
but also the possibility of using HI profile asymmetries to trace merger
activity. We construct close pair and isolated galaxy catalogues of HI profiles
from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey, and using a simple HI flux
ratio, quantify and compare the profile asymmetries between the two catalogues.
In this way, we investigate the popular proposition that merger activity causes
HI profiles to become asymmetric, and thereby probe the role of mergers in
galaxy evolution. We find small but significant differences between the
asymmetry distributions of the two samples, indicating that merger activity
does indeed enhance asymmetry in the global HI profile.

Title:Glitch time series and size distributions in eight prolific pulsars,"
Abstract:  Glitches are rare spin-up events that punctuate the smooth slow-down of the
rotation of pulsars. For the Vela pulsar and PSR J0537-6910, the glitch sizes
and the times between consecutive events have clear preferred scales, contrary
to the handful of other pulsars with enough glitches for such a study.
Moreover, PSR J0537-6910 is the only pulsar showing a strong positive
correlation between the size of each glitch and the waiting time until the
following one.
We attempt to understand this behavior through a detailed study of the
distributions and correlations of glitch properties for the eight pulsars with
at least ten detected glitches. We model the distributions of glitch sizes and
times between consecutive glitches for this sample and perform Monte Carlo
simulations to explore two hypotheses that could explain why the correlation is
so much weaker in other pulsars than in PSR J0537-6910.
We confirm the above results for the Vela pulsar and PSR J0537-6910, and
verify that the latter is the only pulsar with a strong correlation between
glitch size and waiting time to the following glitch. For the remaining six
pulsars, the waiting time distributions are best fitted by exponentials, and
the size distributions either by power laws, exponentials, or log-normal
functions. Some pulsars in the sample yield significant Pearson and Spearman
coefficients ($r_p$ and $r_s$) for the aforementioned correlation. Moreover,
for all except the Crab, both coefficients are positive. Our simulations show
that the weaker correlations in pulsars other than PSR J0537$-$6910 cannot be
due to missing glitches too small to be detected. We also tested the hypothesis
that each pulsar may have two kinds of glitches, namely large, correlated ones
and small, uncorrelated ones. We found for all pulsars that their glitches are
not consistent with a pure uncorrelated population either.

Title:The EREBOS project -- Investigating the effect of substellar and low-mass stellar companions on late stellar evolution,"
Abstract:  Eclipsing post-common envelope binaries are highly important for resolving
the poorly understood, very short-lived common envelope phase. Most hot
subdwarfs (sdO/Bs) are the bare He-burning cores of red giants which have lost
almost all of their hydrogen envelopes. This mass loss is often triggered by
common envelope interactions with close stellar or even sub-stellar companions.
In the recently published catalog of eclipsing binaries in the Galactic Bulge
and in the ATLAS survey, we discovered 161 new eclipsing systems showing a
reflection effect by visual inspection of the light curves and using a
machine-learning algorithm. The EREBOS (Eclipsing Reflection Effect Binaries
from Optical Surveys) project aims at analyzing all newly discovered eclipsing
binaries with reflection effect based on a spectroscopic and photometric follow
up. To constrain the nature of the primary we derived the absolute magnitude
and the reduced proper motion of all our targets with the help of the
parallaxes and proper motions measured by the Gaia mission and compared those
to the Gaia white dwarf catalogue. For a sub-set of our targets with observed
spectra the nature could be derived by measuring the atmospheric parameter of
the primary confirming that less than 10\% of our systems are not sdO/Bs with
cool companions but white dwarfs or central stars of planetary nebula. This
large sample of eclipsing hot subdwarfs with cool companions allowed us to
derive a significant period distribution for hot subdwarfs with cool companions
for the first time showing that the period distribution is much broader than
previously thought and ideally suited to find the lowest mass companions to hot
subdwarf stars. In the future several new photometric surveys will be carried
out, which will increase the sample of this project even more giving the
potential to test many aspects of common envelope theory and binary evolution.

Title:Efficient solution of the anisotropic spherically-aligned axisymmetric Jeans equations of stellar hydrodynamics for galactic dynamics,"
Abstract:  I present a flexible solution for the axisymmetric Jeans equations of stellar
hydrodynamics under the assumption of an anisotropic (three-integral) velocity
ellipsoid aligned with the spherical polar coordinate system. I describe and
test a robust and efficient algorithm for its numerical computation. I outline
the evaluation of the intrinsic velocity moments and the projection of all
first and second velocity moments, including both the line-of-sight velocities
and the proper motions. This spherically-aligned Jeans Anisotropic Modelling
(JAM_sph) method can describe in detail the photometry and kinematics of real
galaxies. It allows for a spatially-varying anisotropy, or stellar
mass-to-light ratios gradients, as well as for the inclusion of general dark
matter distributions and supermassive black holes. The JAM_sph method
complements my previously derived cylindrically-aligned JAM_cyl and spherical
Jeans solutions, which I also summarize in this paper. Comparisons between
results obtained with either JAM_sph or JAM_cyl can be used to asses the
robustness of inferred dynamical quantities. As an illustration, I modelled the
Atlas3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies with high-quality integral-field
spectroscopy, using both methods. I found that they provide statistically
indistinguishable total-density logarithmic slopes. This may explain the
previously-reported success of the JAM method in recovering density profiles of
real or simulated galaxies. A reference software implementation of JAM_sph is
included in the publicly-available JAM software package.

Title:Calibrating the cosmic distance ladder using gravitational-wave observations,"
Abstract:  Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are among preeminent distance ladders for
precision cosmology due to their intrinsic brightness, which allows them to be
observable at high redshifts. Their usefulness as unbiased estimators of
absolute cosmological distances however depends on accurate understanding of
their intrinsic brightness, or anchoring their distance scale. This knowledge
is based on calibrating their distances with Cepheids. Gravitational waves from
compact binary coalescences, being standard sirens, can be used to validate
distances to SNe Ia, when both occur in the same galaxy or galaxy cluster. The
current measurement of distances by the advanced LIGO and Virgo detector
network suffers from large statistical errors ($\sim 50\%$). However, we find
that using a third generation gravitational-wave detector network, standard
sirens will allow us to measure distances with an accuracy of $\sim
0.1\%$-$3\%$ for sources within $\le300$ Mpc. These are much smaller than the
dominant systematic error of $\sim 5\%$ due to radial peculiar velocity of host
galaxies. Therefore, gravitational-wave observations could soon add a new
cosmic distance ladder for an independent calibration of distances to SNe Ia.

Title:Interpolation of turbulent magnetic fields and its consequences on diffusive cosmic ray propagation,"
Abstract:  Numerical simulations of the propagation of charged particles through
magnetic fields solving the equation of motion often leads to the usage of an
interpolation in case of discretely defined magnetic fields, typically given on
a homogeneous grid structure. However, the interpolation method influences the
magnetic field properties on the scales of the grid spacing and the choice of
interpolation routine can therefore change the result. At the same time, it
provides an impact, i.e.\ error, on the spatial particle distribution. We
compare three different interpolation routines -- trilinear, tricubic and
nearest neighbor interpolation -- in the case of turbulent magnetic fields and
show that there is no benefit in using trilinear interpolation. We show that in
comparison, the nearest neighbor interpolation provides the best performance,
i.e.\ requires least CPU time and results in the smallest error. In addition,
we optimize the performance of an algorithm that generates a continuous
grid-less turbulent magnetic field by more than an order of magnitude. This
continuous method becomes practicable for the simulation of large particle
numbers and its accuracy is only limited by the used number of wave-modes. We
show that by using more than 100 wave-modes the diffusive behavior of the
spatial particle distribution in form of the diffusion coefficient is
determined with an error less than a few percentage.

Title:Multiple Scales Asymptotic Solution For The Constant Radial Thrust Problem,"
Abstract:  An approximate analytical solution for the two body problem perturbed by a
radial, low acceleration is obtained, using a regularized formulation of the
orbital motion and the method of multiple scales. Formulating the dynamics with
the Dromo special perturbation method allows us to separate the two
characteristic periods of the problem in a clear and physically significative
way, namely the orbital period and a period depending on the magnitude of the
perturbing acceleration. This second period becomes very large compared to the
orbital one for low thrust cases, allowing us to develop an accurate
approximate analytical solution through the method of multiple scales. Compared
to a regular expansion, the multiple scales solution retains the qualitative
contributions of both characteristic periods and has a longer validity range in
time. Looking at previous solutions for this problem, our approach has the
advantage of not requiring the evaluation of special functions or an initially
circular orbit. Furthermore, the simple expression reached for the long period
provides additional insight on the problem. Finally, the behavior of the
asymptotic solution is assessed through several test cases, finding a good
agreement with high-precision numerical solutions. The results presented not
only advance in the study of the two body problem with constant radial thrust,
but confirm the utility of the method of multiple scales for tackling problems
in orbital mechanics.

PNe discoveries have been made by the SuperCOSMOS AAO/UKST H$\alpha$ Survey

However, the list of auto-generated H$\alpha$-excess candidates from these
surveys as well as any photometric survey, prior to spectroscopic follow-up to
confirm their nature, contains all varieties of H$\alpha$-line emitters like
young stellar objects (YSOs), H II regions, compact PNe and emission line stars
of all kinds. The aim of this work is to find new infrared criteria that can
better distinguish compact PNe from their mimics using a machine learning
approach and the photometric data from the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey and
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Three classification tree models have been
developed with the following colour criteria: W1-W4$\ge$7.87 and J-H$<$1.10;
H-W2$\ge$2.24 and J-H$<$0.50; and Ks-W3$\ge$6.42 and J-H$<$1.31 providing a
list of candidates, characterized by a high probability to be genuine PNe. The
contamination of this list of candidates from Ha mimics is low but not
negligible. By applying these criteria to the IPHAS list of PN candidates and
the entire IPHAS and VPHAS+ DR2 catalogues, we find 141 sources, from which 92
are known PNe, 39 are new very likely compact PNe (without an available
classification or uncertain) and 10 are classified as H II regions, Wolf-Rayet
stars, AeBe stars and YSOs. The occurrence of false positive identifications in
this technique is between 10 and 15 per cent.

NICSPol show that, NICSPol can constrain polarization within ~1% for sources
brighter than ~16 magnitude in JHKs bands. NICSPol is a general purpose
instrument which could be used to study variety of astrophysical sources such

Title:Habitability and Spectroscopic Observability of Warm M-dwarf Exoplanets Evaluated with a 3D Chemistry-Climate Model,"
Abstract:  Planets residing in circumstellar habitable zones (CHZs) offer our best
opportunities to test hypotheses of life's potential pervasiveness and
complexity. Constraining the precise boundaries of habitability and its
observational discriminants is critical to maximizing our chances at remote
life detection with future instruments. Conventionally, calculations of the
inner edge of the habitable zone (IHZ) have been performed using both 1D
radiative-convective and 3D general circulation models. However, these models
lack interactive three-dimensional chemistry and do not resolve the mesosphere
and lower thermosphere (MLT) region of the upper atmosphere. Here we employ a
3D high-top chemistry-climate model (CCM) to simulate the atmospheres of
synchronously-rotating planets orbiting at the inner edge of habitable zones of
K- and M-dwarf stars (between $T_{\rm eff} =$ 2600 K and 4000 K). While our IHZ
climate predictions are in good agreement with GCM studies, we find noteworthy
departures in simulated ozone and HO$_{\rm x}$ photochemistry. For instance,
climates around inactive stars do not typically enter the classical moist
greenhouse regime even with high ($< 10^{-3}$ mol mol$^{-1}$) stratospheric
water vapor mixing ratios, which suggests that planets around inactive M-stars
may only experience minor water-loss over geologically significant timescales.
In addition, we find much thinner ozone layers on potentially habitable moist
greenhouse atmospheres, as ozone experiences rapid destruction via reaction
with hydrogen oxide radicals. Using our CCM results as inputs, our simulated
transmission spectra show that both water vapor and ozone features on moist
greenhouse atmospheres could be detectable by instruments NIRSpec and MIRI LRS
onboard the James Webb Space Telescope.

Title:VIS3COS: II. Nature and nurture in galaxy structure and morphology,"
Abstract:  We study the impact of local density and stellar mass on the morphology of
~500 quiescent (Q) and SFGs from the VIS3COS survey. We perform B/D
decomposition of the SBPs and find ~41% of 10^10 Msun galaxies to be best
fitted with 2 components. We complement our analysis with non-parametric
measurements and qualitative visual classifications. We find that galaxy
morphology depends on stellar mass and environment for our sample as a whole.
We only find an impact of the environment on galaxy sizes for galaxies more
massive than 10^11 Msun. We find higher n and B/T in high-density regions when
compared to low-density counterparts at similar stellar masses. We also find
that higher stellar mass galaxies have steeper light profiles compared to the
lower ones. Using visual classifications, we find a morphology-density relation
at z~0.84 for galaxies more massive than 10^10 Msun, with elliptical galaxies
being dominant at high-density regions and disks more common in low-density
regions. However, when splitting the sample into colour-colour selected SF and
Q sub-populations, there are no statistically significant differences between
low- and high-density regions. We find that Q galaxies are smaller, have higher
n, and higher B/T when compared to SF counterparts. We confirm these trends
with non-parametric quantities, finding Q galaxies to be smoother and having
most of their light over smaller areas than SFGs. Overall, we find that the
dependence of morphology on stellar mass is stronger than with local density
and these relations are strongly correlated with the quenching fraction. The
change in average morphology corresponds to a change in the relative fractions
of blue disk-like galaxies and red elliptical galaxies with stellar mass and
environment. We hypothesize that the processes responsible for the quenching of
SF must also affect the galaxy morphology on similar timescales.

"Title:IC 4665 DANCe I. Members, empirical isochrones, magnitude distributions, present-day system mass function, and spatial distribution","
Abstract:  Context. The study of star formation is extremely challenging due to the lack
of complete and clean samples of young, nearby clusters, and star forming
regions. The recent Gaia DR2 catalogue complemented with the deep, ground based
COSMIC DANCe catalogue offers a new database of unprecedented accuracy to
revisit the membership of clusters and star forming regions. The 30 Myr open
cluster IC 4665 is one of the few well-known clusters of this age and it is an
excellent target where to test evolutionary models and study planetary
formation.
Aims. We aim to provide a comprehensive membership analysis of IC 4665 and to
study the following properties: empirical isochrones, distance, magnitude
distribution, present-day system mass function, and spatial distribution.
Methods. We use the Gaia DR2 catalogue together with the DANCe catalogue to
look for members using a probabilistic model of the distribution of the
observable quantities in both the cluster and background populations.
Results. We obtain a final list of 819 candidate members which cover a 12.4
magnitude range (7 < J < 19.4). We find that 50% are new candidates, and we
estimate a conservative contamination rate of 20%. This unique sample of
members allows us to obtain a present-day system mass function in the range of
0.02-6 Msun, which reveals a number of details not seen in previous studies. In
addition, they favour a spherically symmetric spatial distribution for this
young open cluster.
Conclusions. Our membership analysis represents a significant increase in the
quantity and quality (low-contamination) with respect to previous studies. As
such, it offers an excellent opportunity to revisit other fundamental
parameters such as the age.

Title:The Cosmic Expansion History from Line-Intensity Mapping,"
Abstract:  Line-intensity mapping (LIM) of emission form star-forming galaxies can be
used to measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale as far back as the
epoch of reionization. This provides a standard cosmic ruler to constrain the
expansion rate of the Universe at redshifts which cannot be directly probed
otherwise. In light of growing tension between measurements of the current
expansion rate using the local distance ladder and those inferred from the
cosmic microwave background, extending the constraints on the expansion history
to bridge between the late and early Universe is of paramount importance. Using
a newly derived methodology to robustly extract cosmological information from
LIM, which minimizes the inherent degeneracy with unknown astrophysics, we show
that present and future experiments can gradually improve the measurement
precision of the expansion rate history, ultimately reaching percent-level
constraints on the BAO scale. Specifically, we provide detailed forecasts for
the SPHEREx satellite, which will target the H$\alpha$ and Lyman-$\alpha$
lines, and for the ground-based COMAP instrument---as well as a future stage-3
experiment---that will target the CO rotational lines. Besides weighing in on
the so-called Hubble tension, reliable LIM cosmic rulers can enable
wide-ranging tests of dark matter, dark energy and modified gravity.

Title:A User's Guide to Extracting Cosmological Information from Line-Intensity Maps,"
Abstract:  Line-intensity mapping (LIM) provides a promising way to probe cosmology,
reionization and galaxy evolution. However, its sensitivity to cosmology and
astrophysics at the same time is also a nuisance. Here we develop a
comprehensive framework for modelling the LIM power spectrum, which includes
redshift space distortions and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. We then identify
and isolate degeneracies with astrophysics so that they can be marginalized
over. We study the gains of using the multipole expansion of the anisotropic
power spectrum, providing an accurate analytic expression for their covariance,
and find a 10%-60% increase in the precision of the baryon acoustic oscillation
scale measurements when including the hexadecapole in the analysis. We discuss
different observational strategies when targeting other cosmological
parameters, such as the sum of neutrino masses or primordial non-Gaussianity,
finding that fewer and wider bins are typically more optimal. Overall, our
formalism facilitates an optimal extraction of cosmological constraints robust
to astrophysics.

Title:Inferred timescales for common envelope ejection using wide astrometric companions,"
Abstract:  Evolution of close binaries often proceeds through the common envelope stage.
The physics of the envelope ejection (CEE) is not yet understood, and several
mechanisms were suggested to be involved. These could give rise to different
timescales for the CEE mass-loss. In order to probe the CEE-timescales we study
wide companions to post-CE binaries. Faster mass-loss timescales give rise to
higher disruption rates of wide binaries and result in larger average
separations. We make use of data from Gaia DR2 to search for ultra-wide
companions (projected separations $10^3$-$2\times 10^5$ a.u. and $M_2 > 0.4$
M$_\odot$) to several types of post-CEE systems, including sdBs, white-dwarf
post-common binaries, and cataclysmic variables. We find a (wide-orbit)
multiplicity fraction of $1.4\pm 0.2$ per cent for sdBs to be compared with a
multiplicity fraction of $5.0\pm 0.2$ per cent for late-B/A/F stars which are
possible sdB progenitors. The distribution of projected separations of
ultra-wide pairs to main sequence stars and sdBs differs significantly and is
compatible with prompt mass loss (upper limit on common envelope ejection
timescale of $10^2$ years). The smaller statistics of ultra-wide companions to
cataclysmic variables and post-CEE binaries provide weaker constraints.
Nevertheless, the survival rate of ultra-wide pairs to the cataclysmic
variables suggest much longer, $\sim10^4$ years timescales for the CEE in these
systems, possibly suggesting non-dynamical CEE in this regime.

Title:Testing the disk-corona interplay in radiatively-efficient broad-line AGN,"
Abstract:  The correlation observed between monochromatic X-ray and UV luminosities in
radiatively-efficient active galactic nuclei (AGN) lacks a clear theoretical
explanation despite being used for many applications. Such a correlation, with
its small intrinsic scatter and its slope that is smaller than unity in log
space, represents the compelling evidence that a mechanism regulating the
energetic interaction between the accretion disk and the X-ray corona must be
in place. This ensures that going from fainter to brighter sources the coronal
emission increases less than the disk emission. We discuss here a
self-consistently coupled disk-corona model that can identify this regulating
mechanism in terms of modified viscosity prescriptions in the accretion disk.
The model predicts a lower fraction of accretion power dissipated in the corona
for higher accretion states. We then present a quantitative observational test
of the model using a reference sample of broad-line AGN and modeling the
disk-corona emission for each source in the $L_X-L_{UV}$ plane. We used the
slope, normalization, and scatter of the observed relation to constrain the
parameters of the theoretical model. For non-spinning black holes and static
coronae, we find that the accretion prescriptions that match the observed slope
of the $L_X-L_{UV}$ relation produce X-rays that are too weak with respect to
the normalization of the observed relation. Instead, considering
moderately-outflowing Comptonizing coronae and/or a more realistic
high-spinning black hole population significantly relax the tension between the
strength of the observed and modeled X-ray emission, while also predicting very
low intrinsic scatter in the $L_X-L_{UV}$ relation. In particular, this latter
scenario traces a known selection effect of flux-limited samples that
preferentially select high-spinning, hence brighter, sources.

Title:Active asteroid (6478) Gault: a blue Q-type surface below the dust?,"
Abstract:  We present near-infrared spectroscopy of the sporadically active asteroid
(6478) Gault collected on the 3 m NASA/Infrared Telescope Facility observatory
in late 2019 March/early April. Long-exposure imaging with the 0.5 m NEEMO T05
telescope and previously published data simultaneously monitored the asteroid
activity, providing context for our measurements. We confirm Gault is a
silicate-rich (Q- or S-type) object likely linked to the (25) Phocaea
collisional family. The asteroid exhibits substantial spectral variability over
the 0.75-2.45 $\mu$m wavelength range, from unusual blue (s'=-13.5+/-1.1%
$\mu$m-1 to typical red (s'=+9.1+/-1.2% $\mu$m-1) spectral slope, that does not
seem to correlate with activity. Spectral comparisons with samples of ordinary
chondrite meteorites suggest that the blue color relates to the partial loss of
the asteroid dust regolith, exposing a fresh, dust-free material at its
surface. The existence of asteroids rotating close to rotational break-up limit
and having similar spectral properties as Gault further supports this
interpretation. Future spectroscopic observations of Gault, when the tails
dissipate, will help further testing of our proposed hypothesis.

Title:The GAPS Programme with HARPS-N at TNG XIX. Atmospheric Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and improved parameters of KELT-9b,"
Abstract:  In the framework of the GAPS project, we observed the planet-hosting star
KELT-9 (A-type star, VsinI$\sim$110 km/s) with the HARPS-N spectrograph at the
TNG. In this work we analyse the spectra and the extracted radial velocities
(RVs), to constrain the physical parameters of the system and to detect the
planetary atmosphere of KELT-9b. We extracted from the high-resolution optical
spectra the mean stellar line profiles with an analysis based on the Least
Square Deconvolution technique. Then, we computed the stellar RVs with a method
optimized for fast rotators, by fitting the mean stellar line profile with a
purely rotational profile instead of using a Gaussian function. The new spectra
and analysis led us to update the orbital and physical parameters of the
system, improving in particular the value of the planetary mass to $M_{\rm
p}=2.88\pm0.35\,M_{\rm Jup}$. We discovered an anomalous in-transit RV
deviation from the theoretical Rossiter-McLaughlin effect solution, calculated
from the projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda=-85.78\pm0.46$ degrees measured
with Doppler tomography. We prove that this deviation is caused by the
planetary atmosphere of KELT-9b, thus we name this effect Atmospheric
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. By analysing the magnitude of the RV anomaly, we
obtained information on the extension of the planetary atmosphere as weighted
by the model used to retrieve the stellar mean line profiles, which is up to
$1.22\pm0.02\,R_{\rm p}$. The Atmospheric Rossiter-McLaughlin effect will be
observable for other exoplanets whose atmosphere has non-negligible correlation
with the stellar mask used to retrieve the RVs, in particular ultra-hot
Jupiters with iron in their atmosphere. The duration and amplitude of the
effect will depend not only on the extension of the atmosphere, but also on the
in-transit planetary RVs and on the projected rotational velocity of the parent
star.

Title:Intrinsic Morphology of Ultra-diffuse Galaxies,"
Abstract:  With the published data of apparent axis ratios for 1109 ultra-diffuse
galaxies (UDGs) located in 17 low-redshift (z~ 0.020 - 0.063) galaxy clusters
and 84 UDGs in 2 intermediate-redshift (z~ 0.308 - 0.348) clusters, we take
advantage of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach and assume a ubiquitous
triaxial model to investigate the intrinsic morphologies of UDGs. In contrast
to the conclusion of Burkert (2017), i.e., the underlying shapes of UDGs are
purely prolate ($C=B<A$), we find that the data favor the oblate-triaxial
models ($C<B\lesssim A$) over the nearly prolate ones. We also find that the
intrinsic morphologies of UDGs are relevant to their stellar
masses/luminosities, environments, and redshifts. First, for the low-redshift
UDGs in the same environment, the more-luminous ones are always thicker than
the less-luminous counterparts, possibly due to the more voilent internal
supernovae feedback or external tidal interactions for the progenitors of the
more-luminous UDGs. The UDG thickness dependence on luminosity is distinct from
that of the typical quiescent dwarf ellipticals (dEs) and dwarf spheroidals
(dSphs) in the local clusters and groups, but resembles that of massive
galaxies; in this sense, UDGs may not be simply treated as an extension of the
dE/dSph class with similar evolutionary histories. Second, for the low-redshift
UDGs within the same luminosity range, the ones with smaller cluster-centric
distances are more puffed-up, probably attributed to tidal interactions.
Finally, the intermediate-redshift cluster UDGs are more flattened, which
plausibly suggests a `disky' origin for high-redshift, initial UDGs.

Title:An unusual transient following the short GRB 071227,"
Abstract:  We present X-ray and optical observations of the short duration gamma-ray
burst GRB 071227 and its host at $z=0.381$, obtained using \textit{Swift},
Gemini South and the Very Large Telescope. We identify a short-lived and
moderately bright optical transient, with flux significantly in excess of that
expected from a simple extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum at 0.2-0.3 days
after burst. We fit the SED with afterglow models allowing for high extinction
and thermal emission models that approximate a kilonova to assess the excess'
origins. While some kilonova contribution is plausible, it is not favoured due
to the low temperature and high luminosity required, implying superluminal
expansion and a large ejecta mass of $\sim 0.1$ M$_{\odot}$. We find, instead,
that the transient is broadly consistent with power-law spectra with additional
dust extinction of $E(B-V)\sim0.4$ mag, although a possibly thermal excess
remains in the \textit{z}-band. We investigate the host, a spiral galaxy with
an edge-on orientation, resolving its spectrum along its major axis to
construct the galaxy rotation curve and analyse the star formation and chemical
properties. The integrated host emission shows evidence for high extinction,
consistent with the afterglow findings. The metallicity and extinction are
consistent with previous studies of this host and indicate the galaxy is a
typical, but dusty, late-type SGRB host.

Title:When Cold Radial Migration is Hot: Constraints from Resonant Overlap,"
Abstract:  It is widely accepted that stars in a spiral disk, like the Milky Way's, can
radially migrate on order a scale length over the disk's lifetime. With the
exception of cold torquing, also known as ""churning,"" processes that contribute
to the radial migration of stars are necessarily associated with kinematic
heating. Additionally, it is an open question whether or not an episode of cold
torquing is kinemically cold over long radial distances. This study uses a
suite of analytically based simulations to investigate the dynamical response
when stars are subject to cold torquing and are also resonant with an
ultraharmonic. Model results demonstrate that these populations are
kinematically heated and have RMS changes in orbital angular momentum around
corotation that can exceed those of populations that do not experience resonant
overlap. Thus, kinematic heating can occur during episodes of cold torquing. In
a case study of a Milky Way-like disk with an exponential surface density
profile and flat rotation curve, up to 40% of cold torqued stars in the solar
cylinder experience resonant overlap. This fraction increases toward the
galactic center. To first approximation, the maximum radial excursions from
cold torquing depend only on the strength of the spiral pattern and the
underlying rotation curve. This work places an upper limit to these excursions
to be the distance between the ultraharmonics, otherwise radial migration near
corotation can kinematically heat. The diffusion rate for kinematically cold
radial migration is thus constrained by limiting the step size in the random
walk approximation.

Title:High Fidelity Imaging of the Inner AU Mic Debris Disk: Evidence of Differential Wind Sculpting?,"
Abstract:  We present new high fidelity optical coronagraphic imagery of the inner
$\sim$50 au of AU Mic's edge-on debris disk using the BAR5 occulter of the
Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) obtained on 26-27 July
2018. This new imagery reveals that ""feature A"", residing at a projected
stellocentric separation of 14.2 au on SE-side of the disk, exhibits an
apparent ""loop-like"" morphology at the time of our observations. The loop has a
projected width of 1.5 au and rises 2.3 au above the disk midplane. We also
explored TESS photometric observations of AU Mic that are consistent with
evidence of two starspot complexes in the system. The likely co-alignment of
the stellar and disk rotational axes breaks degeneracies in detailed spot
modeling, indicating that AU Mic's projected magnetic field axis is offset from
its rotational axis. We speculate that small grains in AU Mic's disk could be
sculpted by a time-dependent wind that is influenced by this offset magnetic
field axis, analogous to co-rotating Solar interaction regions that sculpt and
influence the inner and outer regions of our own Heliosphere. Alternatively, if
the observed spot modulation is indicative of a significant mis-alignment of
the stellar and disk rotational axes, we suggest the disk could still be
sculpted by the differential equatorial versus polar wind that it sees with
every stellar rotation.

Title:Young star cluster populations in the E-MOSAICS simulations,"
Abstract:  We present an analysis of young star clusters (YSCs) that form in the
E-MOSAICS cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies and their star
cluster populations. Through comparisons with observed YSC populations, this
work aims to test models for YSC formation and obtain an insight into the
formation processes at work in part of the local galaxy population. We find
that the models used in E-MOSAICS for the cluster formation efficiency and
high-mass truncation of the initial cluster mass function ($M_\mathrm{c,\ast}$)
both quantitatively reproduce the observed values of cluster populations in
nearby galaxies. At higher redshifts ($z \geq 2$, near the peak of globular
cluster formation) we find that, at a constant star formation rate (SFR)
surface density, $M_\mathrm{c,\ast}$ is larger than at $z=0$ by a factor of
four due to the higher gas fractions in the simulated high-redshift galaxies.
Similar processes should be at work in local galaxies, offering a new way to
test the models. We find that cluster age distributions may be sensitive to
variations in the cluster formation rate (but not SFR) with time, which may
significantly affect their use in tests of cluster mass loss. By comparing
simulations with different implementations of cluster formation physics, we
find that (even partially) environmentally-independent cluster formation is
inconsistent with the brightest cluster-SFR and specific
luminosity-$\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ relations, whereas these observables are
reproduced by the fiducial, environmentally-varying model. This shows that
models in which a constant fraction of stars form in clusters are inconsistent
with observations.

Title:Lensing convergence and anisotropic dark energy in galaxy redshift surveys,"
Abstract:  Analyses of upcoming galaxy surveys will require careful modelling of
relevant observables such as the power spectrum of galaxy counts in harmonic
space $C_\ell(z,z')$. We investigate the impact of disregarding relevant
relativistic effects by considering a model of dark energy including constant
sound speed, constant equation of state $w_0$, and anisotropic stress. Here we
show that neglecting the effect of lensing convergence will lead to substantial
shifts in cosmological parameters such as the galaxy bias $b_0$, the value of
the dark energy equation of state today $w_0$, and the Hubble constant $H_0$.
Interestingly, neglecting the effect of lensing convergence in this kind of
models results in shifting $H_0$ downwards, something which could shed light on
the current tension between local and CMB determinations of the Hubble
constant.

Abstract:  Visual representation of information is a fundamental tool for advancing our
understanding of science. It enables the research community to extract new
knowledge from complex datasets, and plays an equally vital role in
communicating new results across a spectrum of public audiences. Visualizations
which make research results accessible to the public have been popularized by
the press, and are used in formal education, informal learning settings, and
all aspects of lifelong learning. In particular, visualizations of astronomical
data (hereafter astrovisualization or astroviz) have broadly captured the human
imagination, and are in high demand.
Astrovisualization practitioners need a wide variety of specialized skills
and expertise spanning multiple disciplines (art, science, technology). As
astrophysics research continues to evolve into a more data rich science,
astroviz is also evolving from artists conceptions to data-driven
visualizations, from two-dimensional images to three-dimensional prints,
requiring new skills for development. Currently astroviz practitioners are
spread throughout the country. Due to the specialized nature of the field there
are seldom enough practitioners at one location to form an effective research
group for the exchange of knowledge on best practices and new techniques.
Because of the increasing importance of visualization in modern astrophysics,
the fact that the astroviz community is small and spread out in disparate
locations, and the rapidly evolving nature of this field, we argue for the
creation and nurturing of an Astroviz Community of Practice.
We first summarize our recommendations. We then describe the current make-up
of astrovisualization practitioners, give an overview of the audiences they
serve, and highlight technological considerations.

morphological classification of galaxies. We measure and analyse in detail the
curvature of $14$ galaxies with varied morphology. High (low) steepness
profiles show high (low) curvature measures. Transitions between components are
identified as local peaks oscillations in the values of the curvature. We
identify patterns that characterise bulges (pseudo or classic), disks, bars and
rings. This method can be automated to identify galaxy components in large
datasets or to provide a reliable starting point for traditional multicomponent
modelling of galaxy light distribution.

Title:Ab initio Study of Ground-State CS Photodissociation Via Highly Excited Electronic States,"
Abstract:  Photodissociation by ultraviolet radiation is the key destruction pathway for
CS in photon-dominated regions, such as diffuse clouds. However, the large
uncertainties of photodissociation cross sections and rates of CS, resulting
from a lack of both laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations, limit
the accuracy of calculated abundances of S-bearing molecules by modern
astrochemical models. Here we show a detailed \textit{ab initio} study of CS
photodissociation. Accurate potential energy curves of CS electronic states
were obtained by choosing an active space CAS(8,10) in MRCI+Q/aug-cc-pV(5+d)Z
calculation with additional diffuse functions, with a focus on the \(B\) and
\(C\,^1\Sigma^+\) states. Cross sections for both direct photodissociation and
predissociation from the vibronic ground state were calculated by applying the
coupled-channel method. We found that the \(C-X\) \((0-0)\) transition has
extremely strong absorption due to a large transition dipole moment in the
Franck-Condon region and the upper state is resonant with several triplet
states via spin-orbit couplings, resulting in predissociation to the main
atomic products C \((^3P)\) and S \((^1D)\). Our new calculations show the
photodissociation rate under the standard interstellar radiation field is
\(2.9\ee{-9}\)\,s\(^{-1}\), with a 57\% contribution from \(C-X\) \((0-0)\)
transition. This value is larger than that adopted by the Leiden
photodissociation and photoionization database by a factor of 3.0. Our accurate
\textit{ab initio} calculations will allow more secure determination of
S-bearing molecules in astrochemical models.

Abstract:  A total of 188 high-mass outflows have been identified from a sample of 694
clumps from the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz survey, representing a
detection rate of approximately 27%. The detection rate of outflows increases
from the protostellar stage to the H II stage, but decreases again at the
photodissociation (PDR) stage suggesting that outflows are being switched off
during the PDR stage. An intimate relationship is found between outflow action
and the presence of masers, and water masers appear together with 6.7 GHz
methanol masers. Comparing the infall detection rate of clumps with and without
outflows, we find that outflow candidates have a lower infall detection rate.
Finally, we find that outflow action has some influence on the local
environment and the clump itself, and this influence decreases with increasing
evolutionary time as the outflow action ceases.

Title:An Observational Study for Grain Dynamics in the AS 209 Disk with Submillimeter Polarization,"
Abstract:  We present 870 $\mu$m ALMA polarization observation toward the Class
I\hspace{-.1em}I protoplanetary disk around AS 209, which has concentric,
multiple gaps and rings. We successfully detect the polarized emission and find
that the polarization orientations and fractions have distinct characteristics
between the inner and outer regions. In the inner region, the polarization
orientations are parallel to the minor axis of the disk, which is consistent
with the self-scattering model. The mean polarization fraction in the region is
$\sim$0.2\%, which is lower than the expected value when the grains have the
maximum polarization efficiency, which corresponds to $\lambda$/2$\pi$ $\sim$
140 $\mu$m in grain radius. In the outer region, we detect $\sim$1.0\%
polarization and find that the polarization orientations are almost in the
azimuthal directions. Moreover, the polarization orientations have systematic
angular deviations from the azimuthal directions with $\Delta$$\theta$ $\sim$
4\fdg5 $\pm$ 1\fdg6. The pattern is consistent with a model that radially
drifting dust grains are aligned by the gas flow against the dust grains. We
consider possible scenarios of the grain dynamics at the AS 209 ring which can
reproduce the polarization pattern. However, the directions of the observed
angular deviations are opposite to what is predicted under the fact that the
disk rotates clockwise. This poses a question in our understandings of the
alignment processes and/or grain dynamics in protoplanetary disks.

Title:Dark Matter and HI in Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy UGC 2162,"
Abstract:  Our GMRT HI observations of the ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) UGC 2162,
projected $\sim$ 300 kpc from the centre of the M77 group, reveal it to a have
an extended HI disk (R$_{HI}$/R$_{25}$ $\sim$ 3.3) with a moderate rotational
velocity (V$_{rot} \sim$ 31 km/s). This V$_{rot}$ is in line with that of dwarf
galaxies with similar HI mass. We estimate an M$_{dyn}$ of $\sim$ 1.14 $\times$
10$^{9}$ M$_\odot$ within the galaxy's R$_{HI}$ $\sim$ 5.2 kpc. Additionally,
our estimates of M$_{200}$ for the galaxy from NFW models are in the range of
5.0 to 8.8 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$. Comparing UGC 2162 to samples of UDGs
with HI detections show it to have amongst the smallest R$_e$ with its
M$_{HI}$/M$_{\star}$ being distinctly higher and g -- i colour slightly bluer
than typical values in those samples. We also compared HI and dark matter (DM)
halo properties of UGC 2162 with dwarf galaxies in the LITTLE THINGS sample and
find its DM halo mass and profile are within the range expected for a dwarf
galaxy. While we were unable to to determine the origin of the galaxy's present
day optical form from our study, its normal HI rotation velocity in relation to
its HI mass, HI morphology, environment and dwarf mass DM halo ruled out some
of the proposed ultra diffuse galaxy formation scenarios for this galaxy.

Title:Spatial Variation of the Chemical Properties of Massive Star-forming Clumps,"
Abstract:  We selected 90 massive star-forming clumps with strong N2H+, HCO+, HCN, and
HNC emission from the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz survey. We
obtained Herschel data for all 90 sources and NRAO VLA Sky Survey data for 51
of them. We convolved and regridded all images to the same resolution and pixel
size and derived the temperature, H2 column density, molecules' abundances and
abundance, and ratios of each pixel. Our analysis yields three main
conclusions. First, the abundances of N2H+, HCO+, HCN, and HNC increase when
the column density decreases and the temperature increases, with spatial
variations in their abundances dominated by changes in the H2 column density.
Second, the abundance ratios between N2H+, HCO+, HCN, and HNC also display
systemic variations as a function of the column density due to the chemical
properties of these molecules. Third, the sources associated with the 20 cm
continuum emission can be classified into four types based on the behavior of
the abundances of the four molecules considered here as a function of this
emission. The variations of the first three types could also be attributed to
the variation of the H2 column density.

Title:Physics of relativistic collisionless shocks: III The suprathermal particles,"
Abstract:  In this third paper of a series, we discuss the physics of the population of
accelerated particles in the precursor of an unmagnetized, relativistic
collisionless pair shock. In particular, we provide a theoretical estimate of
their scattering length $l_{scatt}(p)$ in the self-generated electromagnetic
turbulence, as well as an estimate of their distribution function. We obtain
$l_{scatt}(p) \simeq (\gamma_p /\epsilon_B)(p/\gamma_{\infty} mc)^2
(c/\omega_p)$, with p the particle momentum in the rest frame of the shock
front, $\epsilon_B$ the strength parameter of the microturbulence, $\gamma_p$
the Lorentz factor of the background plasma relative to the shock front and
$\gamma_{\infty}$ its asymptotic value outside the precursor. We compare this
scattering length to large-scale PIC simulations and find good agreement for
the various dependencies.

Title:LOFAR discovery of a radio halo in the high-redshift galaxy cluster PSZ2 G099.86+58.45,"
Abstract:  In this Letter, we report the discovery of a radio halo in the high-redshift
galaxy cluster PSZ2 G099.86+58.45 ($z=0.616$) with the LOw Frequency ARray
(LOFAR) at 120-168 MHz. This is one of the most distant radio halos discovered
so far. The diffuse emission extends over $\sim$ 1 Mpc and has a morphology
similar to that of the X-ray emission as revealed by XMM-Newton data. The halo
is very faint at higher frequencies and is barely detected by follow-up 1-2 GHz
Karl G.~Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) observations, which enable us to
constrain the radio spectral index to be $\alpha\leq 1.5-1.6$, i.e.; with
properties between canonical and ultra-steep spectrum radio halos. Radio halos
are currently explained as synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons
that are re-accelerated in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) by turbulence driven
by energetic mergers. We show that in such a framework radio halos are expected
to be relatively common at $\sim150$ MHz ($\sim30-60\%$) in clusters with mass
and redshift similar to PSZ2 G099.86+58.45; however, at least 2/3 of these
radio halos should have steep spectrum and thus be very faint above $\sim 1$
GHz frequencies. Furthermore, since the luminosity of radio halos at high
redshift depends strongly on the magnetic field strength in the hosting
clusters, future LOFAR observations will also provide vital information on the
origin and amplification of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters.

Title:The galaxy power spectrum from TGSS ADR1 and the effect of flux calibration systematics,"
Abstract:  We explore the large to moderate scale anisotropy in distant radio sources
using the TGSS ADR1 catalog. We use different measures, i.e. number counts, sky
brightness and flux per source, for this study. In agreement with earlier
results, we report a significant excess of clustering signal above the angular
scale of roughly $10$ degrees (i.e. $l\lessapprox 20-30$). We find that some
survey areas have a systematically low/high flux and argue this may be the
cause of the observed signal of excess power at low multipoles. With mocks we
demonstrate the effect of such large scale flux systematics and recover TGSS
like excess clustering signal by assuming $20\%$ flux uncertainties over $\sim
10^\circ \times 10^\circ$ size patches. We argue that that TGSS at this stage,
i.e. TGSS ADR1, is not suitable for large scale clustering measurements. We
find that the measure, flux per source, shows evidence of isotropy for all
multipoles $l > 2$ despite the presence of systematics in the data.

Title:Next-generation telescopes with curved focal surface for ultra-low surface brightness surveys,"
Abstract:  In spite of major advances in both ground- and space-based instrumentation,
the ultra-low-surface brightness universe (ULSB) still remains a largely
unexplored volume in observational parameter space. ULSB observations provide
unique constraints on a wide variety of objects, from the Zodiacal light all
the way to the optical cosmological background radiation, through dust cirri,
mass loss shells in giant stars, LSB galaxies and the intracluster light. These
surface brightness levels (>28-29 mag arcsec^-2) are observed by maximising the
efficiency of the surveys and minimising or removing the systematics arising in
the measurement of surface brightness. Based on full-system photon Monte Carlo
simulations, we present here the performance of a ground-based telescope aimed
at carrying out ULSB observations, with a curved focal surface design. Its
off-axis optical design maximises the field of view while minimising the focal
ratio. No lenses are used, as their multiple internal scatterings increase the
wings of the point spread function (PSF), and the usual requirement of a flat
focal plane is relaxed through the use of curved CCD detectors. The telescope
has only one unavoidable single refractive surface, the cryostat window, and
yet it delivers a PSF with ultra-compact wings, which allows the detection, for
a given exposure time, of surface brightness levels nearly three orders of
magnitude fainter than any other current telescope.

Title:Revisiting Kepler-444 Part I. Seismic modelling and inversions of stellar structure,"
Abstract:  Context. The CoRoT and Kepler missions have paved the way for synergies
between exoplanetology and asteroseismology. The use of seismic data helps
providing stringent constraints on the stellar properties which directly impact
the results of planetary studies. Amongst the most interesting planetary
systems discovered by Kepler, Kepler-444 is unique by the quality of its
seismic and classical stellar constraints. Its magnitude, age and the presence
of 5 small-sized planets orbiting this target makes it an exceptional testbed
for exoplanetology. Aims. We aim at providing a detailed characterization of
Kepler-444, focusing on the dependency of the results on variations of key
ingredients of the theoretical stellar models. This thorough study will serve
as a basis for future investigations of the planetary evolution of the system
orbiting Kepler-444. Methods. We use local and global minimization techniques
to study the internal structure of the exoplanet-host star Kepler-444. We
combine seismic observations from the Kepler mission, Gaia DR2 data and revised
spectroscopic parameters to precisely constrain its internal structure and
evolution. Results. We provide updated robust and precise determinations of the
fundamental parameters of Kepler-444 and demonstrate that this low-mass star
bore a convective core during a significant portion of its life on the
main-sequence. Using seismic data, we are able to estimate the lifetime of the
convective core to approximately 8 Gyr out of the 11 Gyr of the evolution of
Kepler-444. The revised stellar parameters found by our thorough study are M =
0.754 +- 0.03M_Sun , R = 0.753 +- 0.01R_Sun , Age = 11 +- 1 Gy.

Title:Beyond second-order convergence in simulations of magnetised binary neutron stars with realistic microphysics,"
Abstract:  We investigate the impact of using high-order numerical methods to study the
merger of magnetised neutron stars with finite-temperature microphysics and
neutrino cooling in full general relativity. By implementing a fourth-order
accurate conservative finite-difference scheme we model the inspiral together
with the early post-merger and highlight the differences to traditional
second-order approaches at the various stages of the simulation. We find that
even for finite-temperature equations of state, convergence orders higher than
second order can be achieved in the inspiral and post-merger for the
gravitational-wave phase. We further demonstrate that the second-order scheme
overestimates the amount of proton-rich shock-heated ejecta, which can have an
impact on the modelling of the dynamical part of the kilonova emission.
Finally, we show that already at low resolution the growth rate of the magnetic
energy is consistently resolved by using a fourth-order scheme.

Title:The dynamics of AR 12700 in its early emerging phase II: fan-shaped activities relevant to arch filament systems,"
Abstract:  The emergence of active regions (ARs) closely relates to the solar dynamo and
the dynamical atmospheric phenomena.With high-resolution and long-lasting
observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, we report a new dynamic
activity phenomenon named ""fan-shaped activity (FSA)"" in the emerging phase of
NOAA AR 12700. The FSAs are clearly observed at Ha wavelength and are closely
related to the dynamics of the adjacent arch filament system (AFS), including
threads deformation and materials downward motions. On 2018 February 26, the
two most representative FSAs appeared around 05:21 UT and 06:03 UT,
respectively, and they firstly ascended and then decayed in around 10 minutes.
At the ascending phase, accompanied by the uplifting of an adjacent AFS, each
FSA launches up at one end of the AFS and extends for up to 11 Mm. At the
decaying phase, the FSA gradually vanishes, and materials downflows towards the
other end of the AFS are detected. After checking the evolution of the magnetic
fields of AR 12700, we find that each FSA is located between the end of an AFS
and an adjacent magnetic patch with the same polarity and launches at the onset
of the collision and compression between these two magnetic patches. We propose
that the collision lifts up the AFS, and then the initially compact AFS
laterally expands, resulting in the formation of FSA. A cartoon model is
proposed to depict the activities.

"Title:The Fundamental Vibrational Frequencies and Spectroscopic Constants of the Dicyanoamine Anion, NCNCN$^-$ (C$_2$N$_3^-$): Quantum Chemical Analysis for Astrophysical and Planetary Environments","
Abstract:  Detecting anions in space has relied on a strong collaboration between
theoretical and laboratory analyses to measure rotational spectra and
spectroscopic constants to high accuracy. The advent of improved quantum
chemical tools operating at higher accuracy and reduced computational cost is a
crucial solution for the fundamental characterization of
astrophysically-relevant anions and their detection in the interstellar medium

chemical analysis of the penta-atomic dicyanoamine anion NCNCN$^-$
(C$_2$N$_3^-$), a structurally bent and polar compound. We have performed
high-level coupled cluster theory quartic force field (QFF) computations of
C$_2$N$_3^-$ satisfying both computational cost and accuracy conditions. We
provide for the first time accurate spectroscopic constants and vibrational
frequencies for this ion. In addition to exhibiting various Fermi resonances,
C$_2$N$_3^-$ displays a bright $\nu$2 (2130.9 cm$^{-1}$) and a less intense
$\nu$1 (2190.7 cm$^{-1}$) fundamental vibrational frequency, making for strong
markers for future infrared observations < 5$\mu$m. We have also determined
near-IR overtone and combination bands of the bright fundamentals for which the
2$\nu$2 at 4312.1 cm$^{-1}$ (2.319 $\mu$m) is the best candidate. C$_2$N$_3^-$
could potentially exist and be detected in nitrogen-rich environments of the
ISM such as IRC +10216 and other carbon-rich circumstellar envelopes, or in the
atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan, where advanced N-based reactions may lead to
its formation.

Title:An accurate low-redshift measurement of the cosmic neutral hydrogen density,"
Abstract:  Using a spectral stacking technique, we measure the neutral hydrogen (HI)
properties of a sample of galaxies at $z < 0.11$ across 35 pointings of the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). The radio data contains 1,895
galaxies with redshifts and positions known from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). We carefully quantified the effects of sample bias, aperture used to
extract spectra, sidelobes and weighting technique and use our data to provide
a new estimate for the cosmic HI mass density. We find a cosmic HI mass density
of $\Omega_{\rm HI} = (4.02 \pm 0.26)\times 10^{-4} h_{70}^{-1}$ at $\langle
z\rangle = 0.066$, consistent with measurements from blind HI surveys and other
HI stacking experiments at low redshifts. The combination of the small
interferometer beam size and the large survey volume makes our result highly
robust against systematic effects due to confusion at small scales and cosmic
variance at large scales. Splitting into three sub-samples with $\langle
z\rangle$ = 0.038, 0.067 and 0.093 shows no significant evolution of the HI gas
content at low redshift.

Title:Nearly coeval intermediate-age Milky Way star clusters at very different dynamics evolutionary stages,"
Abstract:  We report astrophysical properties of 12 Milky Way open clusters located
beyond the circle around the Sun where the number of catalogued open clusters
is thought to be statistically complete. By using deep optical photometry, we
estimated their ages and metallicities on the basis of a maximum likelihood
approach, using cluster members identified from Gaia DR2 data and likelihood
procedures. The studied clusters turned out to be of intermediate-age (0.8 -
4.0 Gyr), with metallicities spanning the range [Fe/H] ~ -0.5 - +0.1 dex, and
distributed within the general observed trend of the Milky Way disc radial and
perpendicular metallicity gradients. As far as we are aware, these are the
first metal abundance estimates derived for these clusters so far. From the
constructed stellar density radial profiles and cluster mass functions we
obtained a variety of structural and internal dynamics evolution parameters.
They show that while the innermost cluster regions would seem to be mainly
shaped according to the respective internal dynamics evolutionary stages, the
outermost ones would seem to be slightly more sensitive to the Milky Way tidal
field. The nearly coeval studied clusters are experiencing different levels of
two-body relaxation following star evaporation; those at more advanced stages
being more compact objects. Likewise, we found that the more important the
Milky way tides, the larger the Jacobi volume occupied by the clusters,
irrespective of their actual sizes and internal dynamics evolutionary stages.

Title:Young magnetars with fracturing crusts as fast radio burst repeaters,"
Abstract:  Fast radio bursts are millisecond-duration radio pulses of extragalactic
origin. A recent statistical analysis has found that the burst energetics of
the repeating source FRB 121102 follow a power-law, with an exponent that is
curiously consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes. This hints
that repeat-bursters may be compact objects undergoing violent tectonic
activity. For young magnetars, possessing crustal magnetic fields which are
both strong ($B \gtrsim 10^{15}$ G) and highly multipolar, Hall drift can
instigate significant field rearrangements even on $\lesssim$ century long
timescales. This reconfiguration generates zones of magnetic stress throughout
the outer layers of the star, potentially strong enough to facilitate frequent
crustal failures. In this paper, assuming a quake scenario, we show how the
crustal field evolution, which determines the resulting fracture geometries,
can be tied to burst properties. Highly anisotropic stresses are generated by
the rapid evolution of multipolar fields, implying that small, localised cracks
can occur sporadically throughout the crust during the Hall evolution. Each of
these shallow fractures may release bursts of energy, consistent in magnitude
with those seen in the repeating sources FRB 121102 and FRB 180814.J0422+73.

Title:Measuring the HI mass function below the detection threshold,"
Abstract:  We present a Bayesian Stacking technique to directly measure the HI mass
function (HIMF) and its evolution with redshift using galaxies formally below
the nominal detection threshold. We generate galaxy samples over several sky
areas given an assumed HIMF described by a Schechter function and simulate the
HI emission lines with different levels of background noise to test the
technique. We use Multinest to constrain the parameters of the HIMF in a broad
redshift bin, demonstrating that the HIMF can be accurately reconstructed,
using the simulated spectral cube far below the HI mass limit determined by the
$5\sigma$ flux-density limit, i.e. down to $M_{\rm HI} = 10^{7.5}$ M$_{\odot}$
over the redshift range $0 < z < 0.55$ for this particular simulation, with a
noise level similar to that expected for the MIGHTEE survey. We also find that
the constraints on the parameters of the Schechter function, $\phi_{\star}$,
$M_\star$ and $\alpha$ can be reliably fit, becoming tighter as the background
noise decreases as expected, although the constraints on the redshift evolution
are not significantly affected. All the parameters become better constrained as
the survey area increases. In summary, we provide an optimal method for
estimating the HI mass at cosmological distances that allows us to constrain
the HI mass function below the detection threshold in forthcoming HI surveys.
This study is a first step towards the measurement of the HIMF at high
($z>0.1$) redshifts.

Abstract:  This approach permits much finer adjustments of the beam direction and
position when compared to other beam steering techniques of the same mechanical
precision. This results in a much increased precision, accuracy and mechanical
stability. A precision of better than 5 {\mu}rad and 5 {\mu}m is demonstrated,
resulting in a resolution in coupling efficiency of 0.1%. Together with the
added flexibility of an additional beam steering element, this allows a great
simplification of the design of the fiber coupler, which normally is the most
complex and sensitive element on an optical fiber breadboard. We demonstrate a
fiber to fiber coupling efficiency of more than 89.8%, with a stability of 0.2%
in a stable temperature environment and 2% fluctuations over a temperature
range from 10C to 40C over a measurement time of 14 hours. Furthermore, we do
not observe any non-reversible change in the coupling efficiency after
performing a series of tests over large temperature variations. This technique
finds direct application in proposed missions for quantum experiments in space,
e.g.where laser beams are used to cool and manipulate atomic clouds.

Abstract:  We study magnetogenesis in axionlike inflation driven by a pseudoscalar field
$\phi$ coupled axially to the electromagnetic (EM) field $(\beta/M_{p})\phi
F_{\mu\nu}\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$ with dimensionless coupling constant $\beta$. A
set of equations for the inflaton field, scale factor, and expectation values
of quadratic functions of the EM field is derived. These equations take into
account the Schwinger effect and the backreaction of generated EM fields on the
Universe expansion. It is found that the backreaction becomes important when
the EM energy density reaches the value $\rho_{\rm EM}\sim
(\sqrt{2\epsilon}/\beta)\rho_{\rm inf}$ ($\epsilon$ is the slow-roll parameter
and $\rho_{\rm inf}$ is the energy density of the inflaton) slowing down the
inflaton rolling and terminating magnetogenesis. The Schwinger effect becomes
relevant when the electric energy density exceeds the value $\rho_{E}\sim
\alpha_{\rm EM}^{-3} (\rho_{\rm tot}^{2}/M_{p}^{4})$, where $\rho_{\rm
tot}=3H^{2}M_{p}^{2}$ is the total energy density and $\alpha_{\rm EM}$ is the
EM coupling constant. For large $\beta$, produced charged particles could
constitute a significant part of the Universe energy density even before the
preheating stage. Numerically studying magnetogenesis in the $\alpha$-attractor
model of inflation, we find that it is possible to generate helical magnetic
fields with the maximal strength $10^{-15}\,{\rm G}$, however, only with the
correlation length of order $1\,{\rm pc}$ at present.

Title:Detection of white dwarf spin period variability in the intermediate polar V2306 Cygni,"
Abstract:  Magnetic cataclysmic variables are close binaries which consist of a compact
object - a white dwarf - and a red dwarf filling its Roche Lobe. Such systems
are physical laboratories which enable study of the influence of magnetic
fields on matter flows. They often exhibit spin-up or spin-down of the white
dwarf, while some systems exhibit more complex behaviour of the spin period
change. We monitor changes of the spin periods of white dwarfs in a sample of
close binary systems to study interaction of the magnetic field and accretion
processes as well as evolution of intermediate polars. Within the framework of
our intermediate polar monitoring program, we obtained photometric CCD
observations at several observatories. Two-period trigonometric polynomial
fitting was used for determination of extrema timings. The (O-C) analysis was
performed to study the variability of the orbital and spin periods of the
systems. Using data taken during 9 years of observations of the magnetic
cataclysmic variable V2306 Cygni (formerly known as 1WGA J1958.2+3232), we
detected the spin period variability which shows a spin-up of the white dwarf
with a characteristic time of $(53\pm5)\cdot10^4$ years. The value of the spin
period was $733.33976$ seconds with the formal accuracy of $0.00015$ seconds.
We derived an improved value of the orbital period of the system to be

Title:Scaling relations for solar-like oscillations: a review,"
Abstract:  The scaling relations for solar-like oscillations provide a translation of
the features of the stochastic low-degree modes of oscillation in the Sun to
predict the features of solar-like oscillations in other stars with convective
outer layers. This prediction is based on their stellar mass, radius and
effective temperature. Over time, the original scaling relations have been
reversed in their use from predicting features of solar-like oscillations to
deriving stellar parameters. Updates to the scaling relations as well as their
reference values have been proposed to accommodate for the different
requirements set by the change in their use. In this review the suggestions for
improving the accuracy of the estimates of stellar parameters through the
scaling relations for solar-like oscillations are presented together with a
discussion of pros and cons of different approaches.

Abstract:  Since several years ago, the search for multiple populations (MPs) in
Galactic open clusters (OCs) has become a field of increasing interest,

stellar parameters and abundances of 17 different chemical species, including
light and iron-peak elements of the old open cluster NGC188, from the APOGEE
DR14 database. I selected 15 bonafide cluster red giants that reveal an spread
in [Na/Fe] of +-0.16 dex, caused by two different groups of measurements whose
mean [Na/Fe] values differ by ~ 0.30 dex. A hint for a subtle anti-correlation
with Al and TiII, which also show relative large [X/Fe] dispersions, is also
seen in the data. However, [Na/Fe] abundances have been found to be typically
affected by uncertainties of 0.16 dex. Furthermore, I directly compared the
available spectra for stars with similar atmospheric parameters and it would
seem that they look similar. Therefore, I warn users of large spectroscopic
surveys to be extra careful when finding peculiar abundance results. Analysis
pipelines that run in an unsupervised fashion may produce bad results which may

Title:Prospects of strongly lensed repeating fast radio bursts: complementary constraints on dark energy evolution,"
Abstract:  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly dispersed and probably extragalactic
radio flashes with millisecond-duration. Recently, the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment (using the CHIME/FRB instrument) has reported
detections of 13 FRBs during a pre-commissioning phase. It is more exciting
that one of the 13 FRBs is a second source of repeaters which suggests that
CHIME/FRB and other wide-field sensitive radio telescopes will find a
substantial population of repeating FRBs. We have proposed strongly lensed
repeating FRBs as a precision cosmological probe, e.g. constraining the Hubble
constant and model-independently estimating the cosmic curvature. Here, we
study complementary constraints on the equation of state of dark energy from
strongly lensed FRBs to currently available popular probes. It is found that,
in the framework of Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parametrization, adding time
delay measurement of 30 strongly lensed FRB systems to cosmic microwave
background radiation and type Ia supernovae can improve the dark energy figure
of merit by a factor 2. In the precision cosmology era, this improvement is of
great significance for studying the nature of dark energy.

Title:Inferring the 3-D shapes of extremely metal-poor galaxies from sets of projected shapes,"
Abstract:  The three-dimensional (3-D) shape of a galaxy inevitably is tied to how it
has formed and evolved and to its dark matter halo. Local extremely metal-poor
galaxies (XMPs; defined as having an average gas-phase metallicity < 0.1 solar)
are important objects for understanding galaxy evolution largely because they
appear to be caught in the act of accreting gas from the cosmic web, and their
3-D shape may reflect this. Here we report on the 3-D shape of XMPs as inferred
from their observed projected minor-to-major axial ratios using a hierarchical
Bayesian inference model, which determines the likely shape and orientation of
each galaxy while simultaneously inferring the average shape and dispersion. We
selected a sample of 149 XMPs and divided it into three sub-samples according
to physical size and found that (1) the stellar component of XMPs of all sizes
tends to be triaxial, with an intermediate axis approx 0.7 times the longest
axis and that (2) smaller XMPs tend to be relatively thicker, with the shortest
axis going from approx 0.15 times the longest axis for the large galaxies to
approx 0.4 for the small galaxies. We provide the inferred 3-D shape and
inclination of the individual XMPs in electronic format. We show that our
results for the intermediate axis are not clouded by a selection effect against
face-on XMPs. We discuss how an intermediate axis significantly smaller than
the longest axis may be produced by several mechanisms, including lopsided gas
accretion, non-axisymmetric star formation, or coupling with an elongated dark
matter halo. Large relative thickness may reflect slow rotation, stellar
feedback, or recent gas accretion.

Title:The aspherical explosion of the Type IIP SN 2017gmr,"
Abstract:  Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP), which represent the most common class of
core-collapse (CC) SNe, show a rapid increase in continuum polarization just
after entering the tail phase. This feature can be explained by a highly
asymmetric helium core, which is exposed when the hydrogen envelope becomes
transparent. Here we report the case of a SN IIP (SN~2017gmr) that shows an
unusually early rise of the polarization, $\gtrsim 30$ days before the start of
the tail phase. This implies that SN~2017gmr is an SN IIP that has very
extended asphericity. The asymmetries are not confined to the helium core, but
reach out to a significant part of the outer hydrogen envelope, hence clearly
indicating a marked intrinsic diversity in the aspherical structure of CC
explosions. These observations provide new constraints on the explosion
mechanism, where viable models must be able to produce such extended deviations
from spherical symmetry, and account for the observed geometrical diversity.

Title:Chirping compact stars: gravitational radiation and detection degeneracy with binary systems A conceptual pathfinder for space-based gravitational-wave observatories,"
Abstract:  Compressible, Riemann S-type ellipsoids can emit gravitational waves (GWs)
with a chirp-like behavior (hereafter chirping ellipsoids, CELs). We show that
the GW frequency-amplitude evolution of CELs (mass $\sim 1$~M$_\odot$, radius
$\sim10^3$~km, polytropic equation of state with index $n\approx 3$) is
indistinguishable from that emitted by double white dwarfs (DWDs) and by
extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) composed of an intermediate-mass
(e.g.~$10^3~M_\odot$) black hole and a planet-like (e.g.~$10^{-4}~M_\odot$)
companion, in a specific frequency interval within the detector sensitivity
band in which the GWs of all these systems are quasi-monochromatic. We estimate
that for reasonable astrophysical assumptions, the rates in the local Universe
of CELs, DWDs and EMRIs in the mass range considered here, are very similar,
posing a detection-degeneracy challenge for space-based GW detectors. The
astrophysical implications of this CEL-binary detection degeneracy by
space-based GW-detection facilities, are outlined.

Title:Planet formation in clusters,"
Abstract:  One well-tested method in science is to separate the object of interest from
its surroundings and look at it in isolation. The advantage is that unimportant
information is removed and the true properties of the object are seen more
clearly. However, sometimes the influences of the surroundings actually
determine the properties of an object. In this case, not taking the environment
into account can lead to incomplete or even false conclusions. In the context
of planet formation this question arises to: is it sufficient to study the
nascent planetary system in isolation? Stars usually do not form in isolation
but as part of a stellar group. The first important question in this field is
then: How important is the influence of the surrounding stars on circumstellar
discs and forming planetary systems?} We can also pose a second question: Does
radiation or gravitational interaction dominate? Here I give my perspective on
these two questions.

Title:Time-dependent evolution of the protoplanetary discs with magnetic winds,"
Abstract:  We study the evolution of the protoplanetary discs (PPDs) in the presence of
magnetically driven winds with the stress relations motivated by the non-ideal
MHD disc simulations. Contribution of the magnetic winds in the angular
momentum removal and mass loss are described using these relations which are
quantified in terms of the plasma parameter. Evolution of the essential disc
quantities including the surface density, accretion rate and wind mass loss
rate are studied for a wide range of the model parameters. Two distinct phases
of the disc evolution are found irrespective of the adopted input parameters.
While at the early phase of the disc evolution, global disc quantities such as
its total mass and magnetic flux undergo non-significant reductions, their
rapid declines are found in the second phase of evolution. Duration of each
phase, however, depends upon the model parameters including magnetic wind
strength. Our model predicts that contributions of the magnetic winds in the
disc evolution are significant during the second phase. We then calculated
locus of points in the plane of the accretion rate and total disc mass
corresponding to an ensemble of evolving PPDs. Our theoretical isochrone tracks
exhibit reasonable fits to the observed PPDs in star forming regions Lupus and
$\sigma$-Orion.

Title:Gaussian Mixture Models for Blended Photometric Redshifts,"
Abstract:  Future cosmological galaxy surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope (LSST) will photometrically observe very large numbers of galaxies.
Without spectroscopy, the redshifts required for the analysis of these data
will need to be inferred using photometric redshift techniques that are
scalable to large sample sizes. The high number density of sources will also
mean that around half are blended. We present a Bayesian photometric redshift
method for blended sources that uses Gaussian mixture models to learn the joint
flux-redshift distribution from a set of unblended training galaxies, and
Bayesian model comparison to infer the number of galaxies comprising a blended
source. The use of Gaussian mixture models renders both of these applications
computationally efficient and therefore suitable for upcoming galaxy surveys.

Title:The dynamical evolution of close-in binary systems formed by a super-Earth and its host star. Case of the Kepler-21 system,"
Abstract:  The aim of this work is to develop a formalism for the study of the secular
evolution of a binary system which includes interaction due to the tides that
each body imparts on the other. We also consider the influence of the
$J_2$-related secular terms on the orbital evolution and the torque, caused by
the triaxiality, on the rotational evolution, both of which are associated only
to one of the bodies. We apply these set of equations to the study of the
orbital and rotational evolution of a binary system composed of a rocky planet
and its host star in order to characterize the dynamical evolution at work,
particularly near spin-orbit resonances. We used the equations of motion that
give the time evolution of the orbital elements and the spin rates of each body
to study the time evolution of the Kepler-21 system as an example of how the
formalism that we have developed can be applied. We obtained a set of equations
of motion without singularities for vanishing eccentricities and inclinations.
This set gives, on one hand, the time evolution of the orbital elements due to
the tidal potentials generated by both members of the system as well as the
triaxiality of one of them. On the other hand, it gives the time evolution of
the stellar spin rate due to the corresponding tidal torque and of the planet's
rotation angle due to both the tidal and triaxiality-induced torques. We found
that for the parameters and the initial conditions explored here, the tidally
and triaxiality-induced modifications of the tidal modes can be more
significative than expected and that the time of tidal synchronization strongly
depends on the values of the rheological parameters.

Title:Forming one of the most massive objects in the Universe: The quadruple merger in Abell 1758,"
Abstract:  Abell1758 is a system of two galaxy clusters, a more massive, northern
cluster and a southern cluster. Both parts are undergoing major merger events
at different stages. Although the mass of the merger constituents provides
enough energy to produce visible shock fronts in the X-ray, none have been
found to date. We present detailed temperature and abundance maps based on
Chandra ACIS data, and identify several candidates for shocks and cold fronts
from a smoothed gradient map of the surface brightness. One candidate can be
confirmed as the missing shock front in the northern cluster through X-ray
spectroscopy. Non-thermal radio emission observed with the GMRT confirms the
presence of radio halos in the northern and southern clusters, and shows
evidence for a relic in the periphery of the southern cluster. We do not find
evidence for shocked gas between A1758N and A1758S.

Title:Determining the Transport of Magnetic Helicity and Free Energy in the Sun's Atmosphere,"
Abstract:  The most important factors determining solar coronal activity are believed to
be the availability of magnetic free energy and the constraint of magnetic
helicity conservation. Direct measurements of the helicity and magnetic free
energy in the coronal volume are difficult, but their values may be estimated
from measurements of the helicity and free energy transport rates through the
photosphere. We examine these transport rates for a topologically open system
such as the corona, in which the magnetic fields have a nonzero normal
component at the boundaries, and derive a new formula for the helicity
transport rate at the boundaries. In addition, we derive new expressions for
helicity transport due to flux emergence/submergence versus photospheric
horizontal motions. The key feature of our formulas is that they are manifestly
gauge invariant. Our results are somewhat counterintuitive in that only the
lamellar electric field produced by the surface potential transports helicity
across boundaries, and the solenoidal electric field produced by a surface
stream function does not contribute to the helicity transport. We discuss the
physical interpretation of this result. Furthermore, we derive an expression
for the free energy transport rate and show that a necessary condition for free
energy transport across a boundary is the presence of a closed magnetic field
at the surface, indicating that there are current systems within the volume. We
discuss the implications of these results for using photospheric vector
magnetic and velocity field measurements to derive the solar coronal helicity
and magnetic free energy, which can then be used to constrain and drive models
for coronal activity.

Title:Classification of Close Binary Stars Using Recurrence Networks,"
Abstract:  Close binary stars are binary stars where the component stars are close
enough such that they can exchange mass and/or energy. They are subdivided into
semi-detached, overcontact or ellipsoidal binary stars. A challenging problem
in the context of close binary stars, is their classification into these
subclasses, based solely on their light curves. Conventionally, this is done by
observing subtle features in the light curves like the depths of adjacent
minima, which is tedious when dealing with large datasets. In this work we
suggest the use of machine learning algorithms applied to measures of
recurrence networks and nonlinear time series analysis to differentiate between
classes of close binary stars. We show that overcontact binary stars occupy a
region different from semi-detached and ellipsoidal binary stars in a plane of
characteristic path length(CPL) and average clustering coefficient(CC),
computed from their recurrence networks. We use standard clustering algorithms
and report that the clusters formed corresponds to the standard classes with a
high degree of accuracy.

"Title:In the Galactic disk, stellar [Fe/H] and age predict orbits and precise [X/Fe]","
Abstract:  We explore the structure of the element abundance--age--orbit distribution of
the stars in the Milky Way's low-$\alpha$ disk, by (re-)deriving precise
[Fe/H], [X/Fe] and ages, along with orbits, for red clump stars from the APOGEE
survey. There has been a long-standing theoretical expectation and
observational evidence that metallicity ([Fe/H]) and age are informative about
a star's orbit, e.g. about its angular momentum and the corresponding mean
Galactocentric distance or its vertical motion. Indeed, our analysis of the
APOGEE data confirms that [Fe/H] or age alone can predict the stars' orbits far
less well than the combination of the two. Remarkably, we find and show
explicitly, that for known [Fe/H] and age, the other abundances [X/Fe] of
Galactic disk stars can be predicted well (on average to 0.02 dex) across a
wide range of Galactocentric radii, and therefore provide little additional
information, e.g. for predicting their orbit. While the age-abundance space for
metal poor stars and potentially for stars near the Galactic center is rich or
complex, for the bulk of the Galaxy's low-$\alpha$ disk it is simple: [Fe/H]
and age contain most information, unless [X/Fe] can be measured to 0.02, or
better. Consequently, we do not have the precision with current (and likely
near-future) data to assign stars to their individual (coeval) birth clusters,
from which the disk is presumably formed. We can, however, place strong
constraints on future models of galactic evolution, chemical enrichment and
mixing.

Abstract:  Holm 15A, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of the galaxy cluster Abell 85,
has an ultra-diffuse central region, 2 mag fainter than the faintest depleted
core of any early-type galaxy (ETG) that has been dynamically modelled in
detail. We use orbit-based, axisymmetric Schwarzschild models to analyse the
stellar kinematics of Holm 15A from new high-resolution, wide-field spectral
observations obtained with MUSE at the VLT. We find a supermassive black hole
(SMBH) with a mass of (4.0 +- 0.80) x 10^10 solar masses at the center of Holm
15A. This is the most massive black hole with a direct dynamical detection in
the local universe. We find that the distribution of stellar orbits is
increasingly biased towards tangential motions inside the core. However, the
tangential bias is less than in other cored elliptical galaxies. We compare
Holm 15A with N-body simulations of mergers between galaxies with black holes
and find that the observed amount of tangential anisotropy and the shape of the
light profile are consistent with a formation scenario where Holm 15A is the
remnant of a merger between two ETGs with pre-existing depleted cores. We find
that black hole masses in cored galaxies, including Holm 15A, scale inversely
with the central stellar surface brightness and mass density, respectively.
These correlation are independent of a specific parameterization of the light
profile.

Title:Analytic Description of Primordial Black Hole Formation from Scalar Field Fragmentation,"
Abstract:  Primordial black hole (PBH) formation is a more generic phenomenon than was
once thought. The dynamics of a scalar field in inflationary universe can
produce PBHs under mild assumptions regarding the scalar potential. In the
early universe, light scalar fields develop large expectation values during
inflation and subsequently relax to the minimum of the effective potential at a
later time. During the relaxation process, an initially homogeneous scalar
condensate can fragment into lumps via an instability similar to the
gravitational (Jeans) instability, where the scalar self-interactions, rather
than gravity, play the leading role. The fragmentation of the scalar field into
lumps (e.g. Q-balls or oscillons) creates matter composed of relatively few
heavy ""particles"", whose distribution is subject to significant fluctuations
unconstrained by comic microwave background (CMB) observations and unrelated to
the large-scale structure. If this matter component comes to temporarily
dominate the energy density before the scalar lumps decay, PBHs can be
efficiently produced during the temporary matter-dominated era. We develop a
general analytic framework for description of PBH formation in this class of
models. We highlight the differences between the scalar fragmentation scenario
and other commonly considered PBH formation models. Given the existence of the
Higgs field and the preponderance of scalar fields within supersymmetric and
other models of new physics, PBHs constitute an appealing and plausible
candidate for dark matter.

Abstract:  Growing evidence in recent years suggests a systematic variation of the
stellar initial mass function (IMF), being top-heavy for starburst galaxies and
possibly bottom-heavy for massive ellipticals. Galaxy chemical evolution
simulations adopting an invariant canonical IMF face difficulty in
simultaneously reproducing the metallicity and $\alpha$-enhancement of the
massive elliptical galaxies. Applying a variable IMF that changes with time is
a promising solution, however, it is non-trivial to couple a variable IMF
theory with the existing galaxy evolution codes. Here we present the first open
source simulation code which recalculates the galaxy-wide IMF at each time step
according to the Integrated-Galactic-IMF (IGIMF) theory where the galaxy-wide
IMF depends on the galactic star formation rate and metallicity. The resulting
galaxy-wide IMF and metal abundance evolve with time. With this pilot work, we
explore the effect of the IGIMF theory on galaxy chemical evolution in
comparison with an invariant IMF.

Abstract:  We present Hubble Space Telescope 1.4-1.6 micron images of the hosts of ten
extremely red quasars (ERQs) and six type 2 quasar candidates at z=2-3. ERQs,
whose bolometric luminosities range between 10^47 and 10^48 erg/sec, show
spectroscopic signs of powerful ionized winds, whereas type 2 quasar candidates
are less luminous and show only mild outflows. After performing careful
subtraction of the quasar light, we clearly detect almost all host galaxies.
The median rest-frame B-band luminosity of the ERQ hosts in our sample is
10^11.2 L_Sun, or 4 L* at this redshift. Two of the ten hosts of ERQs are in
ongoing mergers. The hosts of the type 2 quasar candidates are 0.6 dex less
luminous, with 2/6 in likely ongoing mergers. Intriguingly, despite some signs
of interaction and presence of low-mass companions, our objects do not show
nearly as much major merger activity as do high-redshift radio-loud galaxies
and quasars. In the absence of an overt connection to major ongoing gas-rich
merger activity, our observations are consistent with a model in which the
near-Eddington accretion and strong feedback of ERQs are associated with
relatively late stages of mergers resulting in early-type remnants. These
results are in some tension with theoretical expectations of galaxy formation
models, in which rapid black hole growth occurs within a short time of a major
merger. Type 2 quasar candidates are less luminous, so they may instead be
powered by internal galactic processes.

period of $2.6$~days and large transit timing variations due to an unknown
perturber. Here we analyze data from Campaigns 16 and 18, detecting the
transits of a second planet, c, with an orbital period of $4.0$~days, librating
in a 3:2 resonance with planet b. Large, anti-correlated timing variations of
both planets exist due to their resonant perturbations. The planets have a
mutual inclination of $2.40^\circ\pm0.25^\circ$, which torqued planet c more
closely into our line-of-sight. Planet c was grazing in Campaign 5 and thus
missed in previous searches; in Campaigns 16 and 18 it is fully transiting, and
its transit depth is three times larger. We improve the stellar properties
using data from Gaia DR2, and using dynamical fits find that both planets are
sub-Neptunes: their masses are $5.77\pm0.18$ and $7.50\pm0.23 M_{\oplus}$ and
their radii are $2.04\pm0.06$ and $2.19\pm0.07$ R$_\oplus$, respectively. These
mass constraints set the precision record for small exoplanets (a few gas
giants have comparable relative precision). These planets lie in the
photoevaporation valley when viewed in Radius-Period space, but due to the
low-luminosity M-dwarf host star, they lie among the atmosphere-bearing planets
when viewed in Radius-Irradiation space. This, along with their densities being
60%-80% that of Earth, suggests that they may both have retained a substantial
gaseous envelope.

Title:Global Simulations of Galactic Discs: Violent Feedback from Clustered Supernovae during Bursts of Star Formation,"
Abstract:  A suite of idealised, global, gravitationally unstable, star-forming galactic
disc simulations with 2 pc spatial resolution, performed with the adaptive mesh
refinement code {\sc ramses} is used in this paper to predict the emergent
effects of supernova feedback. The simulations include a simplified
prescriptions for formation of single stellar populations of mass $\sim 100 \,
M_{\odot}$, radiative cooling, photoelectric heating, an external gravitational
potential for a dark matter halo and an old stellar disc, self-gravity, and a
novel implementation of supernova feedback. The results of these simulations
show that gravitationally unstable discs can generate violent supersonic winds
with mass loading factors $\eta \gtrsim 10$, followed by a galactic fountain
phase. These violent winds are generated by highly clustered supernovae
exploding in dense environments created by gravitational instability, and they
are not produced in simulation without self-gravity. The violent winds
significantly perturb the vertical structure of the disc, which is later
re-established during the galactic fountain phase. Gas resettles into a
quasi-steady, highly turbulent disc with volume-weighted velocity dispersion
$\sigma > 50 \, {\rm km/s}$. The new configuration drives weaker galactic winds
with mass loading factor $\eta \leq 0.1$. The whole cycle takes place in $\leq
10$ dynamical times. Such high time variability needs to be taken into account
when interpreting observations of galactic winds from starburst and
post-starburst galaxies.

Title:Tensions between the Early and the Late Universe,"
Abstract:  The standard cosmological model successfully describes many observations from
widely different epochs of the Universe, from primordial nucleosynthesis to the
accelerating expansion of the present day. However, as the basic cosmological
parameters of the model are being determined with increasing and unprecedented
precision, it is not guaranteed that the same model will fit more precise
observations from widely different cosmic epochs. Discrepancies developing

tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), megamasers, Oxygen-rich Miras and surface
brightness fluctuations (SBF) resulting in a set of six new ones in the last
several months. Here we present the summary plot of the meeting that shows
combining any three independent approaches to measure H$_0$ in the late
universe yields tension with the early Universe values between 4.0$\sigma$ and
5.8$\sigma$. This shows that the discrepancy does not appear to be dependent on
the use of any one method, team, or source. Theoretical ideas to explain the
discrepancy focused on new physics in the decade of expansion preceding
recombination as the most plausible. This is a brief summary of the workshop.

Title:On the ultra-compact nature of the neutron star system 1RXS J170854.4-321857: insights from X-ray spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  The relatively small family of ultra-compact X-ray binary systems is of great
interest for many areas of astrophysics. We report on a detailed X-ray spectral
study of the persistent neutron star low mass X-ray binary 1RXS
J170854.4-321857. We analysed two XMM-Newton observations obtained in late 2004
and early 2005 when, in agreement with previous studies, the system displayed
an X-ray luminosity (0.5-10 keV) of ~1 x 10^36 erg s-1. The spectrum can be
described by a Comptonized emission component with Gamma~1.9 and a distribution
of seed photons with a temperature of ~ 0.23 keV. A prominent residual feature
is present at soft energies, which is reproduced by the absorption model if
over-abundances of Ne and Fe are allowed. We discuss how similar observables,
that might be attributed to the peculiar (non-solar) composition of the plasma
donated by the companion star, are a common feature in confirmed and candidate
ultra-compact systems. Although this interpretation is still under debate, we
conclude that the detection of these features along with the persistent nature
of the source at such low luminosity and the intermediate-long burst that it
displayed in the past confirms 1RXS J170854.4-321857as a solid ultra-compact
X-ray binary candidate.

Title:Impact of the collision model on the multi-messenger emission from Gamma-Ray Burst internal shocks,"
Abstract:  We discuss the production of multiple astrophysical messengers (neutrinos,
cosmic rays, gamma-rays) in the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) internal shock scenario,
focusing on the impact of the collision dynamics between two shells on the
fireball evolution. In addition to the inelastic case, in which plasma shells
merge when they collide, we study the Ultra Efficient Shock scenario, in which
a fraction of the internal energy is re-converted into kinetic energy and,
consequently, the two shells survive and remain in the system. We find that in
all cases a quasi-diffuse neutrino flux from GRBs at the level of $10^{-11}$ to
$10^{-10} \, \mathrm{GeV \, cm^{-2} \, s^{-1} \, sr^{-1}}$ (per flavor) is
expected for protons and a baryonic loading of ten, which is potentially within
the reach of IceCube-Gen2. The highest impact of the collision model for
multi-messenger production is observed for the Ultra Efficient Shock scenario,
that promises high conversion efficiencies from kinetic to radiated energy.
However, the assumption that the plasma shells separate after a collision and
survive as separate shells within the fireball is found to be justified too
rarely in a multi-collision model that uses hydrodynamical simulations with the
PLUTO code for individual shell collisions.

Title:Interferometric Fringe Visibility Null as a Function of Spatial Frequency: a Probe of Stellar Atmospheres,"
Abstract:  We introduce an observational tool based on visibility nulls in optical
spectro-interferometry fringe data to probe the structure of stellar
atmospheres. In a preliminary demonstration, we use both Navy Precision Optical
Interferometer (NPOI) data and stellar atmosphere models to show that this tool
can be used, for example, to investigate limb darkening.
Using bootstrapping with either multiple linked baselines or multiple
wavelengths in optical and infrared spectro-interferometric observations of
stars makes it possible to measure the spatial frequency $u_0$ at which the
real part of the fringe visibility ${\rm Re}(V)$ vanishes. That spatial
frequency is determined by $u_0 = B_\perp/\lambda_0$, where $B_\perp$ is the
projected baseline length, and $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength at which the null
is observed. Since $B_\perp$ changes with the Earth's rotation, $\lambda_0$
also changes. If $u_0$ is constant with wavelength, $\lambda_0$ varies in
direct proportion to $B_\perp$. Any departure from that proportionality
indicates that the brightness distribution across the stellar disk varies with
wavelength via variations in limb darkening, in the angular size of the disk,
or both.
In this paper, we introduce the use of variations of $u_0$ with $\lambda$ as
a means of probing the structure of stellar atmospheres. Using the equivalent
uniform disk diameter $\theta_{\rm UD, 0}(\lambda_0)$, given by $\theta_{\rm
UD, 0} = 1.22/u_0(\lambda_0)$, as a convenient and intuitive parameterization
of $u_0(\lambda_0)$, we demonstrate this concept by using model atmospheres to
calculate the brightness distribution for $\nu$ Ophiuchi and predict
$\theta_{\rm UD, 0}(\lambda_0)$, and then comparing the predictions to
coherently averaged data from observations taken with the NPOI.

Title:A Trio of Massive Black Holes Caught in the Act of Merging,"
Abstract:  We report the discovery of SDSS J0849+1114 as the first known triple Type 2
Seyfert nucleus. It represents three active black holes that are identified
from new spatially resolved optical slit spectroscopy using the Dual Imaging
Spectrograph on the 3.5 m telescope at the Apache Point Observatory. We also
present new complementary observations including the Hubble Space Telescope
Wide Field Camera 3 U- and Y-band imaging, Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging
Spectrometer S-array X-ray 0.5--8 keV imaging spectroscopy, and NSF Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array radio 9.0 GHz imaging in its most extended A
configuration. These comprehensive multiwavelength observations, when combined
together, strongly suggest that all three nuclei are active galactic nuclei.
While they are now still at kiloparsec-scale separations, where the host-galaxy
gravitational potential dominates, the black holes may evolve into a bound
triple system in $\lesssim$2 Gyr. These triple merger systems may explain the
overly massive stellar cores that have been observed in some elliptical
galaxies such as M87, which are expected to be unique gravitational wave
sources. Similar systems may be more common in the early universe, when galaxy
mergers are thought to have been more frequent.

Title:Sculpting eccentric debris disks with eccentric gas rings,"
Abstract:  Many debris disks seen in scattered light have shapes that imply their dust
grains trace highly eccentric, apsidally aligned orbits. Apsidal alignment is
surprising, especially for dust. Even when born from an apse-aligned ring of
parent bodies, dust grains have their periastra dispersed in all directions by
stellar radiation pressure. The periastra cannot be re-oriented by planets
within the short dust lifetimes at the bottom of the collisional cascade. We
propose that what re-aligns dust orbits is drag exerted by second-generation
gas. Gas is largely immune to radiation pressure, and when released by
photodesorption or collisions within an eccentric ring of parent bodies should
occupy a similarly eccentric, apse-aligned ring. Dust grains launched onto
misaligned orbits cross the eccentric gas ring supersonically and can become
dragged into alignment within collisional lifetimes. The resultant dust
configurations, viewed nearly but not exactly edge-on, with periastra pointing
away from the observer, appear moth-like, with kinked wings and even doubled
pairs of wings, explaining otherwise mysterious features in HD 61005 (""The
Moth"") and HD 32297, including their central bulbs when we account for strong
forward scattering from irregularly shaped particles. Around these systems we
predict gas at Kuiper-belt-like distances to move on highly elliptical
streamlines that owe their elongation, ultimately, to highly eccentric planets.
Unresolved issues and an alternative explanation for apsidal alignment are
outlined.

Title:Probing CO and N$_2$ Snow Surfaces in Protoplanetary Disks with N$_2$H$^+$ Emission,"
Abstract:  Snowlines of major volatiles regulate the gas and solid C/N/O ratios in the
planet-forming midplanes of protoplanetary disks. Snow surfaces are the 2D
extensions of snowlines in the outer disk regions, where radiative heating
results in a decreasing temperature with disk height. CO and N$_2$ are two of
the most abundant carriers of C, N and O. N$_2$H$^+$ can be used to probe the
snow surfaces of both molecules, because it is destroyed by CO and formed from
N$_2$. Here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
observations of N$_2$H$^+$ at 0.2$''$-0.4$''$ resolution in the disks around
LkCa 15, GM Aur, DM Tau, V4046 Sgr, AS 209, and IM Lup. We find two distinctive
emission morphologies: N$_2$H$^+$ is either present in a bright, narrow ring
surrounded by extended tenuous emission, or in a broad ring. These emission
patterns can be explained by two different kinds of vertical temperature
structures. Bright, narrow N$_2$H$^+$ rings are expected in disks with a thick
Vertically Isothermal Region above the Midplane (VIRaM) layer (LkCa 15, GM Aur,
DM Tau) where the N$_2$H$^+$ emission peaks between the CO and N$_2$ snowlines.
Broad N$_2$H$^+$ rings come from disks with a thin VIRaM layer (V4046 Sgr, AS
209, IM Lup). We use a simple model to extract the first sets of CO and N$_2$
snowline pairs and corresponding freeze-out temperatures towards the disks with
a thick VIRaM layer. The results reveal a range of N$_2$ and CO snowline radii
towards stars of similar spectral type, demonstrating the need for empirically
determined snowlines in disks.

Title:Modeling rotational disruption of grains and microwave emission from spinning dust in AGB envelopes,"
Abstract:  Radio observations of some Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star envelopes show
the excess emission at frequencies below 100 GHz which cannot be explained by
thermal dust emission (hereafter anomalous microwave emission-AME). Moreover,
AGB envelopes are a common place where gas molecules condense to form
nanoparticles (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and large grains. In
this paper, we will study whether electric dipole emission from rapidly
spinning nanoparticles can reproduce the AME observed toward AGB stars. To
properly model the size distribution of nanoparticles in the AGB envelope, we
take into account both the increase of nanoparticles due to rotational
disruption of large grains spun-up by radiative torques and the decrease of
smallest nanoparticles due to rotational disruption driven by stochastic gas
collisions. We then perform detailed modeling of microwave emission from
rapidly spinning nanoparticles from both C-rich and O-rich AGB envelopes using
the grain size distribution constrained by rotational disruption. We find that
spinning dust emission is dominant over thermal dust emission at frequencies
below 100 GHz. We attempt to fit the observational data of AME using our
spinning dust model and demonstrate that spinning dust can reproduce the
observed AME in six AGB stars. Finally, we discuss that microwave emission from
spinning dust in AGB envelopes could be observed with high-resolution upcoming
radio telescopes such as ngVLA and ALMA Band 1. This would be a major leap for
understanding AGB envelopes, formation, evolution, and internal structures of
dust. Observations would help to distinguish the carrier of AME from comparing
C-rich to O-rich stars, because PAHs are formed in C-rich AGB stars while
silicates are formed in O-rich stars.

Title:Setting the Stage for the Planet Formation Imager,"
Abstract:  An international group of scientists has begun planning for the Planet
Formation Imager (PFI, this http URL), a next-generation
infrared interferometer array with the primary goal of imaging the active
phases of planet formation in nearby star forming regions and taking planetary
system 'snapshots' of young systems to understand exoplanet architectures. PFI
will be sensitive to warm dust emission using mid-infrared capabilities made
possible by precise fringe tracking in the near-infrared. An L/M band beam
combiner will be especially sensitive to thermal emission from young exoplanets
(and their circumplanetary disks) with a high spectral resolution mode to probe
the kinematics of CO and H2O gas. In this brief White Paper, we summarize the
main science goals of PFI, define a baseline PFI architecture that can achieve
those goals, and identify key technical challenges that must be overcome before
the dreams of PFI can be realized within the typical cost envelope of a major
observatory. We also suggest activities over the next decade at the flagship US
facilities (CHARA, NPOI, MROI) that will help make the Planet Formation Imager
facility a reality. The key takeaway is that infrared interferometry will
require new experimental telescope designs that can scale to 8 m-class with the
potential to reduce per area costs by x10, a breakthrough that would also drive
major advances across astronomy.

Title:HD 965: An extremely peculiar A star with an extremely long rotation period,"
Abstract:  Context. One of the keys to understanding the origin of the Ap stars and
their significance in the general context of stellar astrophysics is the
consideration of the most extreme properties displayed by some of them. In that
context, HD 965 is particularly interesting, as it combines some of the most
pronounced chemical peculiarities with one of the longest rotation periods
known.
Aims. We characterise the variations of the magnetic field of the Ap star HD
965 and derive constraints about its structure.
Methods. We combine published measurements of the mean longitudinal field
<Bz> of HD 965 with new determinations of this field moment from circular
spectropolarimetry obtained at the 6-m telescope BTA of the Special
Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. For the mean
magnetic field modulus <B>, literature data are complemented by the analysis of
ESO archive spectra.
Results. We present the first determination of the rotation period of HD 965,
P = (16.5+/-0.5) y. HD 965 is only the third Ap star with a period longer than
10 years for which magnetic field measurements have been obtained over more
than a full cycle. The variation curve of <Bz> is well approximated by a cosine
wave. <B> does not show any significant variation. The observed behaviour of
these field moments is well represented by a simple model consisting of the
superposition of collinear dipole, quadrupole and octupole. The distribution of
neodymium over the surface of HD 965 is highly non-uniform. The element appears
concentrated around the magnetic poles, especially the negative one.
Conclusions. The shape of the longitudinal magnetic variation curve of HD 965
indicates that its magnetic field is essentially symmetric about an axis
passing through the centre of the star. Overall, as far as its magnetic field
is concerned, HD 965 appears similar to the bulk of the long-period Ap stars.

Title:Chemo-dynamical properties of the Anticenter Stream: a surviving disc fossil from a past satellite interaction,"
Abstract:  Using Gaia DR2, we trace the Anticenter Stream (ACS) in various stellar
populations across the sky and find that it is kinematically and spatially
decoupled from the Monoceros Ring. Using stars from {\sc lamost} and {\sc
segue}, we show that the ACS is systematically more metal-poor than Monoceros
by $0.1$ dex with indications of a narrower metallicity spread. Furthermore,
the ACS is predominantly populated of old stars ($\sim 10\,\rm{Gyr}$), whereas
Monoceros has a pronounced tail of younger stars ($6-10\, \rm{Gyr}$) as
revealed by their cumulative age distributions. Put togehter, all of this
evidence support predictions from simulations of the interaction of the
Sagittarius dwarf with the Milky Way, which argue that the Anticenter Stream
(ACS) is the remains of a tidal tail of the Galaxy excited during Sgr's first
pericentric passage after it crossed the virial radius, whereas Monoceros
consists of the composite stellar populations excited during the more extended
phases of the interaction. We suggest that the ACS can be used to constrain the
Galactic potential, particularly its flattening, setting strong limits on the
existence of a dark disc. Importantly, the ACS can be viewed as a stand-alone
fossil of the chemical enrichment history of the Galactic disc.

scientific value and items of historical importance. Much of this heritage

that the decadal plan include recommendations on (1) compiling a list of
historic sites and development of models for their preservation, (2) carrying
out a comprehensive inventory of astronomy's archival material, and (3)
digitizing, with web-based publication, those photographs and papers judged to
have the most value for scientific and historical investigations. The estimated
cost for an example project on plate preservation is a one-time investment of
less than $10 million over ten years plus the typical on-going costs to
maintain and manage a medium-sized database.

Abstract:  We use a dedicated 0.7-m telescope to image the halos of 119 galaxies in the
Local Volume to $\mu_r \sim 28-30$ mag/arcsec$^2$. The sample is primarily from
the 2MASS Large Galaxy Atlas and extended to include nearby dwarf galaxies and
more distant giant ellipticals, and spans fully the galaxy colour-magnitude
diagram including the blue cloud and red sequence. We present an initial
overview, including deep images of our galaxies. Our observations reproduce
previously reported low surface brightness structures, including extended
plumes in M51, and a newly discovered tidally extended dwarf galaxy in NGC7331.
Low surface brightness structures, or ""envelopes"", exceeding 50 kpc in diameter
are found mostly in galaxies with $M_V<-20.5$, and classic interaction
signatures are infrequent. Defining a halo diameter at the surface brightness
28 mag/arcsec$^2$, we find that halo diameter is correlated with total galaxy
luminosity. Extended signatures of interaction are found throughout the galaxy
colour-magnitude diagram without preference for the red or blue sequences, or
the green valley. Large envelopes may be found throughout the colour-magnitude
diagram with some preference for the bright end of the red sequence. Spiral and
S0 galaxies have broadly similar sizes, but ellipticals extend to notably
greater diameters, reaching 150 kpc. We propose that the extended envelopes of
disk galaxies are dominated by an extension of the disk population rather than
by a classical population II halo.

Title:The electromagnetic radiation whose decay violates the inverse-square law: detailed mathematical treatment of an experimentally realized example,"
Abstract:  I analyse and numerically evaluate the radiation field generated by an
experimentally realized embodiment of an electric polarization current whose
rotating distribution pattern moves with linear speeds exceeding the speed of
light in vacuum. I find that the flux density of the resulting emission (i) has
a dominant value and is linearly polarized within a sharply delineated
radiation beam whose orientation and polar width are determined by the range of
values of the linear speeds of the rotating source distribution, and (ii)
decays with the distance $d$ from the source as $d^{-\alpha}$ in which the
value of $\alpha$ lies between $1$ and $2$ (instead of being equal to $2$ as in
a conventional radiation) across the beam. In that the rate at which boundaries
of the retarded distribution of such a source change with time depends on its
duration monotonically, this is an intrinsically transient emission process:
temporal rate of change of the energy density of the radiation generated by it
has a time-averaged value that is negative (instead of being zero as in a
conventional radiation) at points where the envelopes of the wave fronts
emanating from the constituent volume elements of the source distribution are
cusped. The difference in the fluxes of power across any two spheres centred on
the source is in this case balanced by the change with time of the energy
contained inside the shell bounded by those spheres. These results are relevant
not only to long-range transmitters in communications technology but also to
astrophysical objects containing rapidly rotating neutron stars (such as
pulsars) and to the interpretation of the energetics of the multi-wavelength
emissions from sources that lie at cosmological distances (such as radio and
gamma-ray bursts). The analysis presented in this paper is self-contained and
supersedes my earlier works on this problem.

Abstract:  We use published models of the early Solar System evolution with a slow,
long-range and grainy migration of Neptune to predict the orbital element
distributions and the number of modern-day Centaurs. The model distributions
are biased by the OSSOS survey simulator and compared with the OSSOS Centaur
detections. We find an excellent match to the observed orbital distribution,
including the wide range of orbital inclinations which was the most troublesome
characteristic to fit in previous models. A dynamical model, in which the
original population of outer disk planetesimals was calibrated from Jupiter
Trojans, is used to predict that OSSOS should detect 11+/-4 Centaurs with
semimajor axis a<30 au, perihelion distance q>7.5 au and diameter D>10 km
(absolute magnitude H_r<13.7 for a 6% albedo). This is consistent with 15
actual OSSOS Centaur detections with H_r<13.7. The population of Centaurs is
estimated to be 21,000+/-8,000 for D>10 km. The inner scattered disk at
50<a<200 au should contain (2.0+/-0.8)x10^7 D>10 km bodies and the Oort cloud

different diameter cutoffs can be obtained from the size distribution of
Jupiter Trojans (N(>D) proportional to D^(-2.1) for 5<D<100 km). We discuss

Abstract:  Dark matter evolution during the process of cosmological structure formation

vertices and compute the bispectrum of density perturbations within a one-loop
approximation. We find that the effective vertices play a subdominant role as
compared to the effective viscosity and sound velocity that modify the

perturbation theory in the range where it is applicable, and find a slightly
improved agreement with N-body simulations at larger wavenumbers.

Discovered in a recent set of targeted far-UV $HST$/COS spectroscopic

K. The inferred densities (temperatures) are significantly higher (lower)

absorbers are tracing a cool phase of the intracluster gas in the cluster
outskirts, either associated with gas stripped from cluster galaxies via

high-cadence observations of rotating flare stars probe the complex

mag. We find the Evryscope amplitudes are larger than those in TESS with the
effect correlated to stellar mass (p-value=0.01). We compute the Rossby number
(Ro), and find our sample selected for flaring has twice as many intermediate
rotators (0.04<Ro<0.4) as fast (Ro<0.04) or slow (Ro>0.44) rotators; this may
be astrophysical or a result of period-detection sensitivity. We discover 30
fast, 59 intermediate, and 33 slow rotators. We measure a median starspot
coverage of 13% of the stellar hemisphere and constrain the minimum magnetic
field strength consistent with our flare energies and spot coverage to be 500
G, with later-type stars exhibiting lower values than earlier-types. We observe
a possible change in superflare rates at intermediate periods. However, we do
not conclusively confirm the increased activity of intermediate rotators seen

flare energies, and higher starspot coverage than do long-period rotators, at
p-values of 3.2 X 10^-5, 1.0 X 10^-5, and 0.01, respectively.

matter. We found that: (1) The available astrophysical data can already improve
significantly our current knowledge about the EOS in the density range of
$\rho_0-2.5\rho_0$. In particular, the symmetry energy at twice the saturation
density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter is determined to be
$E_{\mathrm{sym}}(2\rho_0)$ =39.2$_{-8.2}^{+12.1}$ MeV at 68\% confidence
level. (2) A precise measurement of the $R_{1.4}$ alone with a 4\% 1$\sigma$
statistical error but no systematic error will not improve much the constraints
on the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter compared to what we extracted
from using the available radius data. (3) The $R_{1.4}$ radius data and other
general conditions, such as the observed NS maximum mass and causality
condition introduce strong correlations for the high-order EOS parameters.
Consequently, the high-density behavior of $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ inferred
depends strongly on how the high-density SNM EOS $E_0(\rho)$ is parameterized,
and vice versa. (4) The value of the observed maximum NS mass and whether it is
used as a sharp cut-off for the minimum maximum mass or through a Gaussian
distribution affect significantly the lower boundaries of both the $E_0(\rho)$
and $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ only at densities higher than about $2.5\rho_0$.

Title:The Complete Local Volume Groups Sample -- III. Characteristics of group central radio galaxies in the Local Universe,"
Abstract:  Using new 610 MHz and 235 MHz observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope (GMRT) in combination with archival GMRT and Very Large Array (VLA)
survey data we present the radio properties of the dominant early-type galaxies
in the low$-$richness sub-sample of the Complete Local-volume Groups Sample
(CLoGS; 27 galaxy groups) and provide results for the radio properties of the
full CLoGS sample for the first time. We find a high radio detection rate in
the dominant galaxies of the low-richness sub-sample of 82% (22/27); for the
full CLoGS sample, the detection rate is 87% (46/53). The group-dominant
galaxies exhibit a wide range of radio power, 10$^{20}$ $-$ 10$^{25}$ W
Hz$^{-1}$ in the 235 and 610 MHz bands, with the majority (53%) presenting
point-like radio emission, 19% hosting currently active radio jets, 6% having
remnant jets, 9% being diffuse and 13% having no detected radio emission. The
mean spectral index of the detected radio sources in the 235$-$610 MHz
frequency range is found to be $\alpha_{235}^{610}\sim$0.68, and
$\alpha_{235}^{1400}\sim$0.59 in the 235$-$1400 MHz one. In agreement with
earlier studies, we find that the fraction of ultra-steep spectrum sources
($\alpha>$1.3) is $\sim$4%, mostly dependent on the detection limit at 235 MHz.
The majority of point-like systems are found to reside in dynamically young
groups, whereas jet systems show no preference between spiral-rich and
spiral-poor group environments. The mechanical power of the jet sources in the
low$-$richness sample groups is estimated to be $\sim$10$^{42}$ $-$ 10$^{44}$
erg s$^{-1}$ with their black hole masses ranging between 2$\times$10$^{8}$ $-$
5$\times$10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. We confirm previous findings that, while radio
jet sources tend to be associated with more massive black holes, black hole
mass is not the decisive factor in determining jet activity or power.

Title:Two families of elliptical plasma lenses,"
Abstract:  Plasma lensing is the refraction of low-frequency electromagnetic rays due to
free electrons in the interstellar medium. Although the phenomenon has a
distinct similarity to gravitational lensing, particularly in its mathematical
description, plasma lensing introduces other additional features, such as
wavelength dependence, radial rather than tangential image distortions, and
strong demagnification of background sources. Axisymmetrical models of plasma
lenses have been well-studied in the literature, but density distributions with
more complicated shapes can provide new and exotic image configurations and
increase the richness of the magnification properties. As a first step towards
non-axisymmetrical distributions, we study two families of elliptical plasma
lens, softened power-law and exponential plasma distributions. We perform
numerical studies on each lens model, and present them over a parameter space.
In addition to deriving elliptical plasma lens formulae, we also investigate
the number of critical curves that the lens can produce by studying the lens
parameter space, in particular the dependence on the lensing ellipticity. We
find that the introduction of ellipticity into the plasma distribution can
enhance the lensing effects as well as the complexity of the magnification map.

Title:Molecular Bow Shock in the 3-kpc Norma Arm,"
Abstract:  A molecular bow shock (MBS) at G24.4+00+112 ($l\sim 24.4, b\sim 0,
v_{\rm LSR} \sim 112$ km/s) is studied using the 12CO(J=1-0)-line survey
obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope at $20''$ (0.71 pc) resolution. The
terminal velocity uniquely locates the object at the tangent point of the 3-kpc
expanding arm (Norma arm) with the distance of 7.3 kpc. The bow ridge extends
over $\sim 160$ pc ($1.3$) perpendicularly to the galactic plane, and is
concave to a ring of HII-regions centered on G24.6+00 at the same distance. The
edge on the down-stream (higher longitude) side of the MBS is extremely sharp,
and is associated with several elephant trunks in gear-to-gear touch with the
HII regions. On the up-stream (lower longitude) side of MBS, a broad HI bow is
associated at the same velocity. The coherently ordered structure of HI, CO and
HII gases indicates HI-to-\htwo transition at the galactic shock followed by
efficient star formation due to dual compression, where the molecular gas is
shock-compressed from up-stream side by galactic shock and from down-stream
side by HII expansion. We propose a scenario of galactic sequential star
formation (GSSF) along the spiral arms. We also discuss related ISM phenomena
such as the hydraulic jump, bow shock, and Raileigh-Taylor instability
occurring around the MBS.

Title:Shock Heating Energy of Umbral Flashes Measured with Integral Field Unit Spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  Umbral flashes are periodic brightness increases routinely observed in the
core of chromospheric lines within sunspot umbrae and are attributed to
propagating shock fronts. In this work we quantify the shock heating energy of
these umbral flashes using observations in the near infrared He I triplet
obtained on 2014 December 7 with the SpectroPolarimetric Imager for the
Energetic Sun (SPIES), which is a novel integral field unit spectrograph at the
Dunn Solar Telescope. We determine the shock properties (the Mach number and
the propagation speed) by fitting the measured He I spectral profiles with a
theoretical radiative transfer model consisting of two constant property
atmospheric slabs whose temperatures and macroscopic velocities are constrained
by the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. From the Mach number, the shock heating
energy per unit mass of plasma is derived to be 2 x 10^{10} erg g^{-1}, which
is insufficient to maintain the umbral chromosphere. In addition, we find that
the shocks propagate upward with the sound speed and the Mach number does not
depend on the temperature upstream of the shocks. The latter may imply
suppression of the amplification of the Mach number due to energy loss of the
shocks.

Abstract:  We implement a search for exoplanets in campaigns zero through eight (C0-8)

the QATS planet search algorithm to K2 light curves produced by the EVEREST
pipeline, carrying out the C0-8 search on $1.5 \times 10^5$ target stars with
magnitudes in the range of Kp = 9-15. We detect 818 transiting planet
candidates, of which 374 were undiscovered by prior searches, with
{64,15,5,2,1} in {2,3,4,5,6}-planet multi-planet candidate systems,
respectively. Of the new planets detected, 100 orbit M dwarfs, including one
which is potentially rocky and in the habitable zone. 154 of our candidates
reciprocally transit with our Solar System: they are geometrically aligned to
see at least one Solar System planet transit. We find candidates which display
transit timing variations and dozens of candidates on both period extremes with
single transits or ultra-short periods. We point to evidence that our
candidates display similar patterns in frequency and size-period relation as
confirmed planets, such as tentative evidence for the radius gap. Confirmation
of these planet candidates with follow-up studies will increase the number of
K2 planets by up to 50%, and characterization of their host stars will improve
statistical studies of planet properties. Our sample includes many planets
orbiting bright stars amenable for radial velocity follow-up and future
characterization with JWST. We also list the 579 eclipsing binary systems
detected as part of this search.

Title:Model-independent reconstruction of $f(T)$ gravity from Gaussian Processes,"
Abstract:  We apply Gaussian processes and Hubble function data in $f(T)$ cosmology, to
reconstruct for the first time the $f(T)$ form in a model-independent way. In
particular, using $H(z)$ datasets coming from cosmic chronometers as well as
from the radial BAO method, alongside the latest released local value $H_{0} =
73.52 \pm 1.62$ km/s/Mpc, we reconstruct $H(z)$ and its derivatives, resulting
eventually in a reconstructed region for $f(T)$, without any assumption.
Although the cosmological constant lies in the central part of the
reconstructed region, the obtained mean curve follows a quadratic function.
Inspired by this we propose a new $f(T)$ parametrization, i.e. $f(T) =
-2\Lambda +\xi T^2$, with $\xi$ the sole free parameter that quantifies the
deviation from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Additionally, we confront three viable
one-parameter $f(T)$ models of the literature, which respectively are the
power-law, the square-root exponential, and the exponential one, with the
reconstructed $f(T)$ region, and then we extract significantly improved
constraints for their model parameters, comparing to the constraints that arise
from usual observational analysis. Finally, we argue that since we are using
the direct Hubble measurements and the local value for $H_0$ in our analysis,
with the above reconstruction of $f(T)$, the $H_0$ tension can be efficiently
alleviated.

Title:Discovering the Sky at the Longest Wavelengths with Small Satellite Constellations,"
Abstract:  Due to ionosphere absorption and the interference by natural and artificial
radio emissions, ground observation of the sky at the decameter or longer is
very difficult. This unexplored part of electromagnetic spectrum has the
potential of great discoveries, notably in the study of cosmic dark ages and
dawn, but also in heliophysics and space weather, planets, cosmic ray and
neutrinos, pulsar and interstellar medium, extragalactic radio sources, and
even SETI. At a forum organized by the International Space Science
Institute-Beijing (ISSI-BJ), we discussed the prospect of opening up this
window for astronomical observations by using a constellation of small or
micro-satellites. We discussed the past experiments and the current ones such
as the low frequency payload on Chang'e-4 mission lander, relay satellite and
the Longjiang satellite, and also the future DSL mission, which is a linear
array on lunar orbit which can make synthesized map of the whole sky as well as
measure the global spectrum. We also discuss the synergy with other
experiments, including ground global experiments such as EDGES, SARAS, SCI-HI
and High-z, PRIZM/Albatros, ground imaging facillities such as LOFAR and MWA,
and space experiments such as SUNRISE, DARE/DAPPER and PRATUSH. We also

Title:The Low-Frequency Solar Corona in Circular Polarization,"
Abstract:  We present spectropolarimetric imaging observations of the solar corona at
low frequencies (80 - 240 MHz) using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). These
images are the first of their kind, and we introduce an algorithm to mitigate
an instrumental artefact by which the total intensity signal contaminates the
polarimetric images due to calibration errors. We then survey the range of
circular polarization (Stokes V) features detected in over 100 observing runs
near solar maximum during quiescent periods. First, we detect around 700
compact polarized sources across our dataset with polarization fractions
ranging from less than 0.5% to nearly 100%. These sources exhibit a positive
correlation between polarization fraction and total intensity, and we interpret
them as a continuum of plasma emission noise storm (Type I burst) continua
sources associated with active regions. Second, we report a characteristic
""bullseye"" structure observed for many low-latitude coronal holes in which a
central polarized component is surrounded by a ring of the opposite sense. The
central component does not match the sign expected from thermal bremsstrahlung
emission, and we speculate that propagation effects or an alternative emission
mechanism may be responsible. Third, we show that the large-scale polarimetric
structure at our lowest frequencies is reasonably well-correlated with the
line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field component inferred from a global potential
field source surface (PFSS) model. The boundaries between opposite circular
polarization signs are generally aligned with polarity inversion lines in the
model at a height roughly corresponding to that of the radio limb. This is not
true at our highest frequencies, however, where the LOS magnetic field
direction and polarization sign are often not straightforwardly correlated.

Title:Hydrogen Emission in Type II White-light Solar Flares,"
Abstract:  Type II WLFs have weak Balmer line emission and no Balmer jump. We carried
out a set of radiative hydrodynamic simulations to understand how the hydrogen
radiative losses vary with the electron beam parameters and more specifically
with the low energy cutoff. Our results have revealed that for low energy
beams, the excess flare Lyman emission diminishes with increasing low energy
cutoff as the energy deposited into the top chromosphere is low compared to the
energy deposited into the deeper layers. Some Balmer excess emission is always
present and is driven primarily by direct heating from the beam with a minor
contribution from Lyman continuum backwarming. The absence of Lyman excess
emission in electron beam models with high low energy cutoff is a prominent
spectral signature of type II WLFs.

Title:Search for the evolutionary relationship between Galactic globular and open clusters using data from the Gaia DR2 Catalog,"
Abstract:  Passing through the Galactic disk, a massive object such as a globular
cluster, can trigger star formation process leading to the birth of open
clusters. Here, we analyze such possible evolutionary relationship between
globular and open clusters. To search for the closest rapprochement between
objects we computed backwards the orbits of 150 Galactic globular and 232 open
clusters (younger than 100 Myr) with proper motions, derived from the Gaia DR2
Catalog. The orbits were computed using the recently modified three-component
(disk, bulge and halo) axisymmetric Navarro-Frenk-White potential, which was
complemented by non-axisymmetric bar and spiral density wave potentials. We
obtained a new estimate for the frequency of impacts of globular clusters about
the Galactic disk, which is equal to 4 events for 1 million years. In the
framework of the considered scenario, we highlight the following nine pairs of
globular and open clusters, with rapprochement within 1 kpc at the time of the

Title:Indirect evidence of significant grain growth in young protostellar envelopes from polarized dust emission,"
Abstract:  How and when in the star formation sequence do dust grains start to grow into
pebbles is a cornerstone question to both star and planet formation. We compute
the polarized radiative transfer from a model solar-type protostellar core,
using the POLARIS code, aligning the dust grains with the local magnetic field,
following the radiative torques (RATs) theory. We test the dependency of the
resulting dust polarized emission with the maximum grain size of the dust size
distribution at the envelope scale, from amax = 1 micron to 50 micron. Our work
shows that, in the framework of RAT alignment, large dust grains are required
to produce polarized dust emission at levels similar to those currently
observed in solar-type protostellar envelopes at millimeter wavelengths.
Considering the current theoretical dificulties to align a large fraction of
small ISM-like grains in the conditions typical of protostellar envelopes, our
results suggest that grain growth (typically > 10 micron) might have already
significantly progressed at scales 100-1000 au in the youngest objects,
observed less than 10^5 years after the onset of collapse. Observations of dust
polarized emission might open a new avenue to explore dust pristine properties
and describe, for example, the initial conditions for the formation of
planetesimals.

Title:Constraining Dark Energy Perturbations: the Role of Early Dark Energy,"
Abstract:  Dark Energy not only has background effects through its equation of state
$w_{DE}$, but also it can cluster through its sound speed $c^2_{sDE}$, subject
to certain conditions. As is well-known, for dynamical dark energy models, dark
energy perturbations get sourced into matter perturbations through metric
perturbations which is always accompanied by the term $(1+w_{DE})$. Hence, for
dynamical dark energy models with $w_{DE}$ close $-1$, their perturbations get
almost decoupled from metric leaving nearly null imprints on matter power
spectra. Furthermore, Quintessence models with its sound speed equal to speed
of light, washes out almost any inhomogeneities occurred within sub-Hubble
scales, hence making detectability of dark energy perturbations far more
difficult than already is. In this article we look for these imprints by going
beyond Quintessence considering an Early Dark Energy parametrization that not
only have a non-negligible energy density at early times, but also it can
achieve $w_{DE}$ far from $-1$, making dark energy perturbations detectable in
sub-horizon scales. With the help of current datasets, we are able to constrain
sound speed of dark energy to a low value ($c^2_{sDE} \sim 0.14$), along with a
much higher range allowed for early dark energy density, with strong
constraints on it ($\Omega_e \sim 0.02$). We discuss effects of different
datasets on this parametrization along with possible explanation for deviation
on certain parameter(s) comparing between $c^2_{sDE}=1$ case and the case where
it is kept open.

Title:On-sky performance of the SPT-3G frequency-domain multiplexed readout,"
Abstract:  Frequency-domain multiplexing (fMux) is an established technique for the
readout of large arrays of transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers. Each TES in
a multiplexing module has a unique AC voltage bias that is selected by a
resonant filter. This scheme enables the operation and readout of multiple
bolometers on a single pair of wires, reducing thermal loading onto sub-Kelvin
stages. The current receiver on the South Pole Telescope, SPT-3G, uses a 68x
fMux system to operate its large-format camera of $\sim$16,000 TES bolometers.
We present here the successful implementation and performance of the SPT-3G
readout as measured on-sky. Characterization of the noise reveals a median
pair-differenced 1/f knee frequency of 33 mHz, indicating that low-frequency
noise in the readout will not limit SPT-3G's measurements of sky power on large
angular scales. Measurements also show that the median readout white noise
level in each of the SPT-3G observing bands is below the expectation for photon
noise, demonstrating that SPT-3G is operating in the photon-noise-dominated
regime.

Abstract:  To study motions and oscillations in the solar chromosphere and at the
transition region (TR) level we analyze some extreme Doppler shifts observed
off-limb with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Raster scans
and slit-jaw imaging observations performed in the near-ultraviolet (NUV)
channels were used. Large transverse oscillations are revealed by the far wings
profiles after accurately removing the bulk average line profiles of each
sequence. Different regions around the Sun are considered. Accordingly, the
cool material of spicules is observed in Mg II lines rather dispersed up to
coronal heights. In the quiet Sun and especially in a polar coronal hole, we
study dynamical properties of the dispersed spicules-material off-limb using a
high spectral, temporal and spatial resolutions IRIS observations. We suggest
that numerous small-scale jet-like spicules show rapid twisting and swaying
motions evidenced by the large distortion and dispersion of the line profiles,
including impressive periodic Doppler shifts. Most of these events repeatedly
appear in red- and blue-shifts above the limb throughout the whole interval of
the observation datasets with an average swaying speed of order +/-35 kms-1
reaching a maximum value of 50 km s-1 in the polar coronal hole region, well
above the 2.2 Mm heights. We identified for the 1st time waves with a short
period of order of 100 sec and less and transverse amplitudes of order of +/-
20 to 30 km s-1 with the definite signature of Alfven waves. No correlation
exists between brightness and Doppler shift variations; the phase speed of the
wave is very large and cannot definitely be determined from the spectral
features seen along the quasi-radial features. Even shorter periods waves are
evidenced, although their contrast is greatly attenuated by the overlapping
effects along the line of sight.

Title:Using the Extragalactic Gamma-Ray Background to Constrain the Hubble Constant and Matter Density of the Universe,"
Abstract:  The attenuation produced by extragalactic background light (EBL) in
$\gamma$-ray spectra of blazars has been used to constrain the Hubble constant
($H_0$) and matter density ($\Omega_{\rm m}$) of the Universe. We propose to
estimate $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ using the well measured $>$10 GeV
extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background (EGB). This suggestion is based on the
facts that the $>$10 GeV EGB is totally explained by the emissions from
blazars, and an EBL-absorption cutoff occurs at $\sim$50 GeV in the EGB
spectrum. We fit the $>$10 GeV EGB data with modeled EGB spectrum. This results
in $H_0=64.9^{+4.6}_{-4.3}\rm \ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$ and $\Omega_{\rm
m}=0.31^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$. Note that the uncertainties may be underestimated due
to the limit of our realization for EBL model.
$H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ are degenerate in our method.
Independent determination of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ by other methods would improve
the constraint on $H_0$.

Abstract:  The direction of the spin vectors of disk galaxies change over time. We
present the tilting rate of a sample of galaxies in the NIHAO suite of
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Galaxies in our sample have been
selected to be isolated and to have well determined spins. We compare the
tilting rates to the predicted observing limit of Gaia, finding that our entire
sample lies above the limit, in agreement with previous work. To test the role
of dark matter and of gas we compare the weighted Pearson's correlation
coefficients between the tilting rates and various properties. We find no
correlation between the dark halo's tilting rate, shape, or misalignment with
respect to the disc, and the tilting rate of the stellar disc. Therefore, we
argue that, in the presence of gas, the dark halo plays a negligible role in
the tilting of the stellar disc. On the other hand, we find a strong
correlation between the tilting rate of the stellar disc and the misalignment
of the cold gas warp. Adding the stellar mass fraction improves the
correlation, while none of the dark matter's properties together with the cold
gas misalignment improves the correlation to any significant extent. This
implies that the gas cooling onto the disc is the principal driver of disc
tilting.

Abstract:  We present Atacama Large Millimetre Array and Atacama Compact Array
observations of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in the z = 2 galaxy cluster Cl
J1449+0856, an X-ray-detected progenitor of typical massive clusters in the
present day Universe. While in a cleaned but otherwise untouched 92 GHz map of
this cluster, little to no negative signal is visible, careful subtraction of
known sub-millimetre emitters in the uv plane reveals a decrement at 5$\sigma$
significance. The total signal is -190$\pm$36 $\mu$Jy, with a peak offset by
5""-9"" ($\sim$50 kpc) from both the X-ray centroid and the still-forming
brightest cluster galaxy. A comparison of the recovered uv-amplitude profile of
the decrement with different pressure models allows us to derive total mass
constraints consistent with the $\sim$6$\times$10$^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$ estimated
from X-ray data. Moreover, we find no strong evidence for a deviation of the
pressure profile with respect to local galaxy clusters, although a slight
tension at small-to-intermediate spatial scales suggests a flattened central
profile, opposite to what seen in a cool core and possibly an AGN-related
effect. This analysis of the lowest mass single SZ detection so far illustrates
the importance of interferometers when observing the SZ effect in high-redshift
clusters, the cores of which cannot be considered quiescent, such that careful
subtraction of galaxy emission is necessary.

Abstract:  We study the asymmetric distribution of weak photospheric magnetic field
values in the two hemispheres separately using synoptic maps from SDO/HMI,
SOLIS/VSM and WSO during solar cycles 21-24. We calculate the weak-field
asymmetry (shift) by fitting the distributions of weak-field values to a
shifted Gaussian. Hemispheric shifts derived from the three data sets agree
very well, and increase systematically when reducing the spatial resolution of
the map. Shifts of the northern and southern hemisphere are typically opposite
to each other. Shifts follow the evolution of the trailing flux and have a
strong solar cycle variation with maxima in the early to mid-declining phase of
the solar cycle. The sign of the hemispheric weak-field shift is always the
same as the polarity of the polar field in the respective hemisphere and solar
cycle. We also find that shifts in the south are systematically larger in
absolute value than in the north.

Coroniti (1981) and the latter with Marscher and Jorstad (2011). Predictions
are made for the 2019 July 30 superflare in OJ 287. We expect that it will take
place simultaneously at the Spitzer infrared channels as well as in the optical
and that therefore the timing of the flare in optical can be accurately
determined from Spitzer observations. We also discuss in detail the light curve
of the 2015 flare and find that the radiating volume has regions where
bremsstrahlung dominates as well as regions that radiate primarily in
synchrotron radiation. The former region produces the unpolarised first flare
while the latter region gives rise to a highly polarized second flare.

charged energetic particles can be very destructive for sensitive
instrumentation, have to be crossed on every orbit of satellites traveling in
elliptical orbits around the Earth, as is the case for ESA's INTEGRAL and
XMM-Newton missions. This paper presents the first working version of the
5DRBM-e model, a global, data-driven model of the radiation belts for trapped
electrons. The model is based on in-situ measurements of electrons by the
radiation monitors on board the INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton satellites along their
long elliptical orbits for respectively 16 and 19 years of operations. This
model, in its present form, features the integral flux for trapped electrons
within energies ranging from 0.7 to 1.75 MeV. Cross-validation of the 5DRBM-e
with the well-known AE8min/max and AE9mean models for a low eccentricity GPS
orbit shows excellent agreement, and demonstrates that the new model can be
used to provide reliable predictions along widely different orbits around Earth
for the purpose of designing, planning, and operating satellites with more
accurate instrument safety margins. Future work will include extending the
model based on electrons of different energies and proton radiation measurement
data.

Title:Elemental and molecular abundances in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,"
Abstract:  Comets are considered to be some of the most pristine and unprocessed solar
system objects accessible to in-situ exploration. Investigating their molecular
and elemental composition takes us on a journey back to the early period of our
solar system and possibly even further. In this work, we deduce the bulk
abundances of the major volatile species in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,
the target of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission. The basis are
measurements obtained with the ROSINA instrument suite on board the Rosetta
orbiter during a suitable period of high outgassing near perihelion. The
results are combined with both gas and dust composition measurements published
in the literature. This provides an integrated inventory of the major elements
present in the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Similar to comet
1P/Halley, which was visited by ESA's Giotto spacecraft in 1986, comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko also shows near-solar abundances of oxygen and
carbon, whereas hydrogen and nitrogen are depleted compared to solar. Still,
the degree of devolatilization is lower than that of inner solar system
objects, including meteorites and the Earth. This supports the idea that comets
are among the most pristine objects in our solar system.

"Title:BurstCube: Concept, Performance, and Status","
Abstract:  The first simultaneous detection of a short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) with a
gravitational-wave (GW) signal ushered in a new era of multi-messenger
astronomy. In order to increase the number of SGRB-GW simultaneous detections,
we need full sky coverage in the gamma-ray regime. BurstCube, a CubeSat for
Gravitational Wave Counterparts, aims to expand sky coverage in order to detect
and localize gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). BurstCube will be comprised of 4 Cesium
Iodide scintillators coupled to arrays of Silicon photo-multipliers on a 6U
CubeSat bus (a single U corresponds to cubic unit $\sim$10 cm $\times$ 10 cm
$\times$ 10 cm) and will be sensitive to gamma-rays between 50 keV and 1 MeV,
the ideal energy range for GRB prompt emission. BurstCube will assist current
observatories, such as $Swift$ and $Fermi$, in the detection of GRBs as well as
provide astronomical context to gravitational wave events detected by Advanced
LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA. BurstCube is currently in its development and
testing phase to prepare for launch readiness in the fall of 2021. We present

Abstract:  This white paper proposes that AMBITION, a Comet Nucleus Sample Return
mission, be a cornerstone of ESA's Voyage 2050 programme. We summarise some of
the most important questions still open in cometary science after the successes
of the Rosetta mission, many of which require sample analysis using techniques
that are only possible in laboratories on Earth. We then summarise
measurements, instrumentation and mission scenarios that can address these
questions, with a recommendation that ESA select an ambitious cryogenic sample
return mission. Rendezvous missions to Main Belt comets and Centaurs are
compelling cases for M-class missions, expanding our knowledge by exploring new
classes of comets. AMBITION would engage a wide community, drawing expertise
from a vast range of disciplines within planetary science and astrophysics.
With AMBITION, Europe will continue its leadership in the exploration of the
most primitive Solar System bodies.

Title:The Bio-habitable Zone and atmospheric properties for Planets of Red Dwarfs,"
Abstract:  The Kepler data show that habitable small planets orbiting Red Dwarf stars
(RDs) are abundant, and hence might be promising targets to look at for
biomarkers and life. Planets orbiting within the Habitable Zone of RDs are
close enough to be tidally locked. Some recent works have cast doubt on the
ability of planets orbiting RDs to support life. In contrast, it is shown that
temperatures suitable for liquid water and even for organic molecules may exist
on tidally locked planets of RDs for a wide range of atmospheres. We chart the
surface temperature distribution as a function of the irradiation, greenhouse
factor and heat circulation. The habitability boundaries and their dependence
on the atmospheric properties are derived. Extending our previous analyses of
tidally locked planets, we find that tidally locked as well as synchronous (not
completely locked) planets of RDs and K-type stars may support life, for a
wider range of orbital distance and atmospheric conditions than previously
thought. In particular, it is argued that life clement environments may be
possible on tidally locked and synchronously orbiting planets of RDs and K-type
stars, with conditions supporting Oxygenic Photosynthesis, which on Earth was a
key to Complex life. Different climate projections and the biological
significance of tidal locking on putative complex life are reviewed. We show
that when the effect of continuous radiation is taken into account, the
Photo-synthetically Active Radiation (PAR) available on tidally locked planets,
even of RDs, could produce a high Potential Plant Productivity, in analogy to
mid-summer growth at high latitudes on Earth. Awaiting the findings of TESS and
JWST, we discuss the implications of the above arguments to the detection of
biomarkers such as liquid water and oxygen, as well as to the abundance of
biotic planets and life.

Title:The Cosmological Consistency Relation in a Universe with Structure,"
Abstract:  In this short paper we determine the effects of structure on the cosmological
consistency relation which is valid in a perfect Friedmann Universe. We show
that within $\Lambda$CDM the consistency relation is violated by about 1.5% for
redshifts $z\simeq 2$ and this violation raises up to 2% at $z\simeq 5$ and 3%
at $z\simeq 10$ after which it settles at about 2.7% for $z>10$. This effect of
cosmic structure on the distance redshift relation is also very sensitive to
the determination of the dark energy equation of state via cosmic distances. It
actually leads to an apparent unphysical behavior of $w(z)$ which even diverges
at $z\sim 2.5$ and which we also discuss here.

Title:Classifying Exoplanet Candidates with Convolutional Neural Networks: Application to the Next Generation Transit Survey,"
Abstract:  Vetting of exoplanet candidates in transit surveys is a manual process, which
suffers from a large number of false positives and a lack of consistency.
Previous work has shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) provide an
efficient solution to these problems. Here, we apply a CNN to classify planet
candidates from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS). For training
datasets we compare both real data with injected planetary transits and
fully-simulated data, as well as how their different compositions affect
network performance. We show that fewer hand labelled lightcurves can be
utilised, while still achieving competitive results. With our best model, we
achieve an AUC (area under the curve) score of $(95.6\pm{0.2})\%$ and an
accuracy of $(88.5\pm{0.3})\%$ on our unseen test data, as well as
$(76.5\pm{0.4})\%$ and $(74.6\pm{1.1})\%$ in comparison to our existing manual
classifications. The neural network recovers 13 out of 14 confirmed planets
observed by NGTS, with high probability. We use simulated data to show that the
overall network performance is resilient to mislabelling of the training
dataset, a problem that might arise due to unidentified, low signal-to-noise
transits. Using a CNN, the time required for vetting can be reduced by half,
while still recovering the vast majority of manually flagged candidates. In
addition, we identify many new candidates with high probabilities which were
not flagged by human vetters.

Title:Subaru narrow-band imaging search for Lyman continuum from galaxies at z>3 in the GOODS-N field,"
Abstract:  We report results of a search for galaxies at z>3 with Lyman continuum (LyC)
emission using a narrow-band filter NB359 with Subaru / Suprime-Cam in a ~800
arcmin$^2$ blank field around the GOODS-N. We use 103 star-forming galaxies
(SFGs) and 8 AGNs with spectroscopic redshifts in a range between 3.06 and 3.5,
and 157 photometrically selected z=3.1 Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidates
as the targets. After removing galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to be
contaminated by foreground sources, we found two SFGs and one AGN as candidate
LyC emitting sources among the targets with spectroscopic redshifts. Among LAE
candidates, five sources are detected in the NB359 image, and three among them
may be contaminated by foreground sources. We compare the sample galaxies in
the GOODS-N with those in the SSA22, where a prominent protocluster at z=3.1 is
known and the LyC search using the same NB359 filter has been made. Frequency
of galaxies with LyC leakage in the SSA22 field may be about two times higher
than the galaxies in the GOODS-N with the sample UV magnitude range, although
the numbers of LyC detections in these fields are too small to make a
statistically significant conclusion. By combining the sample galaxies in these
fields, we place the 3$\sigma$ upper limits of the observed LyC-to-UV flux
density ratio and LyC escape fraction for galaxies at z=3.1 with absolute UV
magnitude $M_{UV} < -18.8$ as ($f_{LyC}/f_{UV})_{obs} < 0.036$ and

Title:The Emergence of Multiple Populations in Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations of Cluster Formation,"
Abstract:  We present a new approach to understanding star-to-star helium abundance
variations within globular clusters. We begin with detailed radiation
hydrodynamics simulations of cluster formation within giant molecular clouds,
and investigate the conditions under which multiple populations could be
created. Chemical enrichment occurs dynamically as the cluster is assembled. We
test two extreme mechanisms for injection of enriched gas within the clusters,
and find that realistic multiple populations can be formed in both mechanisms.
The stochastic cluster formation histories are dictated by the inherent
randomness of the timing and location of the formation of small clusters, which
rapidly merge to build up the larger cluster, in combination with continual
accretion of gas from the cloud. These cluster formation histories naturally
produce a diversity of abundance patterns across the massive cluster
population. We conclude that multiple populations are a natural outcome of the
typical mode of star cluster formation.

Title:Recent Results from The Askaryan Radio Array,"
Abstract:  The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrino
telescope at the South Pole consisting of an array of radio antennas aimed at
detecting the Askaryan radiation produced by neutrino interactions in the ice.
Currently, the experiment has five stations in operation that have been
deployed in stages since 2012. This contribution focuses on the development of
a search for a diffuse flux of neutrinos in two ARA stations (A2 and A3) from
2013-2016. A background of $\sim 0.01-0.02$ events is expected in one station
in each of two search channels in horizontal- and vertical-polarizations. The
expected new constraints on the flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos based on
four years of analysis with two stations improve on the previous limits set by
ARA by a factor of about two. The projected sensitivity of ARA's five-station
dataset is beginning to be competitive with other neutrino telescopes at high
energies near $10^{10.5}\,$GeV.

Title:It takes two planets in resonance to tango around K2-146,"
Abstract:  K2-146 is a cool, 0.358 M_sun dwarf that was found to host a mini-Neptune
with a 2.67-days period. The planet exhibited strong transit timing variations
(TTVs) of greater than 30 minutes, indicative of the presence of a further
object in the system. Here we report the discovery of the previously undetected
outer planet, K2-146 c, in the system using additional photometric data. K2-146
c was found to have a grazing transit geometry and a 3.97-day period. The outer
planet was only significantly detected in the latter K2 campaigns presumably
because of precession of its orbital plane. The TTVs of K2-146 b and c were
measured using observations spanning a baseline of almost 1200 days. We found
strong anti-correlation in the TTVs, suggesting the two planets are
gravitationally interacting. Our TTV and transit model analyses revealed that
K2-146 b has a radius of 2.25 $\pm$ 0.10 \R_earth and a mass of 5.6 $\pm$ 0.7
M_earth, whereas K2-146 c has a radius of $2.59_{-0.39}^{+1.81}$ R_earth and a
mass of 7.1 $\pm$ 0.9 M_earth. The inner and outer planets likely have moderate
eccentricities of $e = 0.14 \pm 0.07$ and $0.16 \pm 0.07$, respectively.
Long-term numerical integrations of the two-planet orbital solution show that
it can be dynamically stable for at least 2 Myr. The evaluation of the
resonance angles of the planet pair indicates that K2-146 b and c are likely
trapped in a 3:2 mean motion resonance. The orbital architecture of the system
points to a possible convergent migration origin.

Title:Oxygen Isotopic Composition of an Enstatite Ribbon of Probable Cometary Origin,"
Abstract:  Filamentary enstatite crystals are found in interplanetary dust particles of
likely cometary origin but are very rare or absent in meteorites.
Crystallographic characteristics of filamentary enstatites indicate that they
condensed directly from vapor. We measured the O isotopic composition of an
enstatite ribbon from a giant cluster interplanetary dust particle to be
$\delta^{18}\rm{O}{=25{\pm}55}$, $\delta^{17}\rm{O}{=-19{\pm}129}$,
$\Delta^{17}\rm{O}{=-32{\pm}134}$ (2$\sigma$ errors), which is inconsistent at
the 2$\sigma$ level with the composition of the Sun inferred from the Genesis
solar wind measurements. The particle's O isotopic composition, consistent with
the terrestrial composition, implies that it condensed from a gas of non-solar
O isotopic composition, possibly as a result of vaporization of disk region
enriched in $^{16}$O-depleted solids. The relative scarcity of filamentary
enstatite in asteroids compared to comets implies either that this crystal
condensed from dust vaporized \textit{in-situ} in the outer Solar System where
comets formed, or it condensed in the inner Solar System and was subsequently
transported outward to the comet-forming region.

Title:Single-single gravitational-wave captures in globular clusters: Eccentric deci-Hertz sources observable by DECIGO and Tian-Qin,"
Abstract:  We study the formation rate of binary black hole mergers formed through
gravitational-wave emission between unbound, single black holes in globular
clusters. While the formation of these binaries in very dense systems such as
galactic nuclei has been well studied, we show here that this process can
operate in lower-density stellar systems as well, forming binaries at a rate
similar to other proposed pathways for creating eccentric mergers. Recent
advances in post-Newtonian cluster dynamics indicate that a large fraction of
dynamically-assembled binary black holes merge inside their host clusters
during weak and strong binary-single and binary-binary interactions, and that
these systems may retain measurable eccentricities as they travel through the
LIGO and LISA sensitivity bands. Using an analytic approach to modeling binary
black holes from globular clusters, we show that the formation of merging
binaries from previously unbound black holes can operate at a similar rate to
mergers forming during strong binary encounters, and that these binaries
inhabit a unique region of the gravitational-wave frequency space which can be
identified by proposed deci-Hertz space-based detectors.

Title:Calibration of quasi-static aberrations in exoplanet direct-imaging instruments with a Zernike phase-mask sensor. III. On-sky validation in VLT/SPHERE,"
Abstract:  Second-generation exoplanet imagers using extreme adaptive optics and
coronagraphy have demonstrated their great potential for studying close
circumstellar environments and for detecting new companions and helping to
understand their physical properties. However, at very small angular
separation, their performance in contrast is limited by several factors:
diffraction by the complex telescope pupil not perfectly canceled by the
coronagraph, residual dynamic wavefront errors, chromatic wavefront errors, and
wavefront errors resulting from noncommon path aberrations (NCPAs). In a
previous work, we demonstrated the use of a Zernike wavefront sensor called
ZELDA for sensing NCPAs in VLT/SPHERE and their compensation. In the present
work, we move to the next step with the on-sky validation of NCPA compensation
with ZELDA. We start by reproducing previous results on the internal source and
show that the amount of aberration integrated between 1 and 15 cycles/pupil is
decreased by a factor of five, which translates into a gain in raw contrast of
between 2 and 3 below 300 mas. On sky, we demonstrate that NCPA compensation
works in closed loop, leading to an attenuation of the amount of aberration by
a factor of approximately two. However, we identify a loss of sensitivity for
the sensor that is only partly explained by the difference in Strehl ratio
between the internal and on-sky measurements. Coronagraphic imaging on sky is
improved in raw contrast by a factor of 2.5 at most in the ExAO-corrected
region. We use coronagraphic image reconstruction based on a detailed model of
the instrument to demonstrate that both internal and on-sky raw contrasts can
be precisely explained, and we establish that the observed performance after
NCPA compensation is no longer limited by an improper compensation for
aberration but by the current apodized-pupil Lyot coronagraph design.

Title:Metallicity of stars formed throughout the cosmic history based on the observational properties of star forming galaxies,"
Abstract:  Metallicity is one of the crucial factors that determine stellar evolution.
To characterize the properties of stellar populations one needs to know the
fraction of stars forming at different metallicities. Knowing how this fraction
evolves over time is necessary e.g. to estimate the rates of occurrence of any
stellar evolution related phenomena (e.g. double compact object mergers, gamma
ray bursts). Such theoretical estimates can be confronted with observational
limits to validate the assumptions about the evolution of the progenitor system
leading to a certain transient. However, to perform the comparison correctly
one needs to know the uncertainties related to the assumed star formation
history and chemical evolution of the Universe.
We combine the empirical scaling relations and other observational properties
of the star forming galaxies to construct the distribution of the cosmic star
formation rate density at different metallicities and redshifts. We address the
question of uncertainty of this distribution due to currently unresolved
questions, such as the absolute metallicity scale, the flattening in the star
formation--mass relation or the low mass end of the galaxy mass function. We
find that the fraction of stellar mass formed at metallicities <10% solar
(>solar) since z=3 varies by ~18% (~26%) between the extreme cases considered
in our study. This uncertainty stems primarily from the differences in the mass
metallicity relations obtained with different methods. We confront our results
with the local core-collapse supernovae observations. Our model is publicly
available.

Title:J-PLUS: the impact of bars on quenching time-scales in nearby green valley disc galaxies,"
Abstract:  In a framework where galaxies mostly migrate on the colour-magnitude diagram
from star-forming to quiescent, the green valley is considered a transitional
galaxy stage. The details of the processes that drive galaxies from
star-forming to passive systems still remain unknown. We developed a method
that estimates empirically the star formation quenching times-scales of green
valley galaxies, assuming an exponential decay model of the SFH and through a
combination of narrow and broad bands from J-PLUS and GALEX. We correlate these
quenching time-scales with the presence of bars. We find that the J-PLUS
colours F0395-g and F0415-g are sensitive to different SFH, showing, a clear
correlation with the Dn(4000) and H-delta,A spectral indices. We find that
quenching time-scales obtained with our new approach are in agreement with
those determined using spectral indices. We also find that galaxies with high
bar probability tend to quench their star formation slowly. We conclude that:
1) J-PLUS filters can be used to measure quenching timescales in nearby green
valley galaxies; and 2) the resulting star formation quenching time-scales are
longer for barred green valley galaxies. Considering that the presence of a bar
indicates that more violent processes (e.g., major mergers) are absent in host
galaxies, we conclude that the presence of a bar can be used as a morphological
signature for slow star formation quenching.

Title:Testing the relativistic Doppler boost hypothesis for the binary candidate quasar PG1302-102 with multi-band Swift data,"
Abstract:  The bright quasar PG1302-102 has been identified as a candidate supermassive
black hole binary from its near-sinusoidal optical variability. While the
significance of its optical periodicity has been debated due to the stochastic
variability of quasars, its multi-wavelength variability in the ultraviolet
(UV) and optical bands is consistent with relativistic Doppler boost caused by
the orbital motion in a binary. However, this conclusion was based previously
on sparse UV data which were not taken simultaneously with the optical data.
Here we report simultaneous follow-up observations of PG1302-102 with the
Ultraviolet Optical Telescope on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in six
optical + UV bands. The additional nine Swift observations produce light curves
roughly consistent with the trend under the Doppler boost hypothesis, which
predicts that UV variability should track the optical, but with a ~2.2 times
higher amplitude. We perform a statistical analysis to quantitatively test this
hypothesis. We find that the data are consistent with the Doppler boost
hypothesis when we compare the the amplitudes in optical B-band and UV light
curves. However, the ratio of UV to V-band variability is larger than expected
and is consistent with the Doppler model, only if either the UV/optical
spectral slopes vary, the stochastic variability makes a large contribution in
the UV, or the sparse new optical data underestimate the true optical
variability. We have evidence for the latter from comparison with the optical
light curve from ASAS-SN. Additionally, the simultaneous analysis of all four
bands strongly disfavors the Doppler boost model whenever Swift V-band is
involved. Additional, simultaneous optical + UV observations tracing out
another cycle of the 5.2-year proposed periodicity should lead to a definitive
conclusion.

Title:Combined Effects of Rotation and Age Spreads on Extended Main Sequence Turn Offs,"
Abstract:  The extended main sequence turn offs (eMSTOs) of several young to
intermediate age clusters are examined in the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky
Way. We explore the effects of extended star formation (eSF) and a range of
stellar rotation rates on the behavior of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD),
paying particular attention to the MSTO. We create synthetic stellar
populations based on MESA stellar models to simulate observed Hubble Space
Telescope and Gaia star cluster data. We model the effect of rotation as a
non-parametric distribution, allowing for maximum flexibility. In our models
the slow rotators comprise the blueward, and fast rotators the redward portion
of the eMSTO. We simulate data under three scenarios: non-rotating eSF, a range
of rotation rates with a single age, and a combination of age and rotation
effects. We find that two of the five clusters (the youngest and oldest) favor
an age spread, but these also achieve the overall worst fits of all clusters.
The other three clusters show comparable statistical evidence between rotation
and an age spread. In all five cases, a rotation rate distribution alone is
capable of qualitatively matching the observed eMSTO structure. In future work,
we aim to compare our predicted Vsin(i) with observations in order to better
constrain the physics related to stellar rotation.

Title:SN 2018fif: The Explosion of a Large Red Supergiant Discovered in Its Infancy by the Zwicky Transient Facility,"
Abstract:  High cadence transient surveys are able to capture supernovae closer to their
first light than before. Applying analytical models to such early emission, we
can constrain the progenitor stars properties. In this paper, we present
observations of SN2018fif (ZTF18abokyfk). The supernova was discovered close to
first light and monitored by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory. Early spectroscopic observations suggest that the
progenitor of SN2018fif was surrounded by relatively small amounts of
circumstellar material (CSM) compared to all previous cases. This
particularity, coupled with the high cadence multiple-band coverage, makes it a
good candidate to investigate using shock-cooling models. We employ the
SOPRANOS code, an implementation of the model by Sapir & Waxman and its
extension to early times by Morag, Sapir & Waxman. Compared with previous
implementations, SOPRANOS has the advantage of including a careful account of
the limited temporal validity domain of the shock-cooling model as well as
allowing usage of the entirety of the early UV data. We find that the
progenitor of SN2018fif was a large red supergiant, with a radius of
R=744.0_{-128.0}^{+183.0} solar radii and an ejected mass of
Mej=9.3_{-5.8}^{+0.4} solar masses. Our model also gives information on the
explosion epoch, the progenitor inner structure, the shock velocity and the
extinction. The distribution of radii is double-peaked, with lower radii
corresponding to lower values of the extinction, earlier recombination times
and better match to the early UV data. If these correlations persist in future
objects, denser spectroscopic monitoring constraining the time of
recombination, as well as accurate UV observations (e.g. with ULTRASAT), will

Title:Cometary compositions compared with protoplanetary disk midplane chemical evolution. An emerging chemical evolution taxonomy for comets,"
Abstract:  [Abridged] With a growing number of molecules observed in many comets, and an
improved understanding of chemical evolution in protoplanetary disk midplanes,
comparisons can be made between models and observations that could potentially
constrain the formation histories of comets. A $\chi^{2}$-method was used to
determine maximum likelihood surfaces for 14 different comets that formed at a
given time (up to 8 Myr) and place (out to beyond the CO iceline) in the
pre-solar nebula midplane. This was done using observed volatile abundances for
the 14 comets and the evolution of volatile abundances from chemical modelling
of disk midplanes. Considering all parent species (ten molecules) in a scenario
that assumed reset initial chemistry, the $\chi^{2}$ likelihood surfaces show a
characteristic trail in the parameter space with high likelihood of formation
around 30 AU at early times and 12 AU at later times for ten comets. This trail
roughly traces the vicinity of the CO iceline in time. The formation histories
for all comets were thereby constrained to the vicinity of the CO iceline,
assuming that the chemistry was partially reset early in the pre-solar nebula.
This is found, both when considering carbon-, oxygen-, and sulphur-bearing
molecules (ten in total), and when only considering carbon- and oxygen-bearing
molecules (seven in total). Since these 14 comets did not previously fall into
the same taxonomical categories together, this chemical constraint may be
proposed as an alternative taxonomy for comets. Based on the most likely time
for each of these comets to have formed during the disk chemical evolution, a
formation time classification for the 14 comets is suggested.

Title:Real-bogus classification for the Zwicky Transient Facility using deep learning,"
Abstract:  Efficient automated detection of flux-transient, reoccurring flux-variable,
and moving objects is increasingly important for large-scale astronomical
surveys. We present braai, a convolutional-neural-network, deep-learning
real/bogus classifier designed to separate genuine astrophysical events and
objects from false positive, or bogus, detections in the data of the Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF), a new robotic time-domain survey currently in
operation at the Palomar Observatory in California, USA. Braai demonstrates a
state-of-the-art performance as quantified by its low false negative and false
positive rates. We describe the open-source software tools used internally at
Caltech to archive and access ZTF's alerts and light curves (Kowalski), and to
label the data (Zwickyverse). We also report the initial results of the
classifier deployment on the Edge Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) that show
comparable performance in terms of accuracy, but in a much more (cost-)
efficient manner, which has significant implications for current and future
surveys.

Title:Characterization of the Astrophysical Diffuse Neutrino Flux with IceCube High-Energy Starting Events,"
Abstract:  The IceCube neutrino observatory has established the existence of an
astrophysical diffuse neutrino component above $100$ TeV. This discovery was
made using the high-energy starting event sample, which uses the outer layer of
instrumented volume as a veto to significantly reduce atmospheric background.
We present the latest astrophysical neutrino flux measurement using high-energy
starting events. This latest iteration of the analysis extends the sample by
$1.5$ years for a total of $7.5$ years, updates the event properties with newer
models of light transport in the glacial ice, and has an improved systematic
treatment. As part of this new analysis, we report on compatibility of our
observations with detailed isotropic flux models proposed in the literature as
well as the standard generic models such as single, double power-law scenarios.
We find that none of the tested models are substantially preferred with respect
to a single power law.

Title:Optically thin outbursts of rotating neutron stars can not be spherical,"
Abstract:  We investigate three-dimensional relativistic trajectories of test particles
in the spacetime of a slowly rotating compact star, under the combined
influence of gravity and a strong, near-Eddington radiation field. While in the
static case a spherically symmetric shell of matter suspended above the stellar
surface can be formed at the location of radial equilibrium of effective
forces, the same is not true for a rotating star. In the latter case the
symmetry is broken by the interplay between motion in the non-static spacetime
and the influence of strong radiation drag forces, pushing particles towards
the equatorial plane. As a result an expanding spherical shell of matter
ejected from the neutron star surface collapses on a short timescale into a
single stable equatorial ring supported by radiation. These findings have
implications for the geometry of optically thin outflows during luminous
neutron star bursts.

Title:General relativistic orbital decay in a seven-minute-orbital-period eclipsing binary system,"
Abstract:  General relativity predicts that short orbital period binaries emit
significant gravitational radiation, and the upcoming Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect tens of thousands of such systems;
however, few have been identified, and only one is eclipsing--the double white
dwarf binary SDSS J065133.338+284423.37, which has an orbital period of 12.75
minutes. Here, we report the discovery of an eclipsing double white dwarf
binary system with an orbital period of only 6.91 minutes, ZTF
J153932.16+502738.8. This system has an orbital period close to half that of
SDSS J065133.338+284423.37 and an orbit so compact that the entire binary could
fit within the diameter of the planet Saturn. The system exhibits a deep
eclipse, and a double-lined spectroscopic nature. We observe rapid orbital
decay, consistent with that expected from general relativity. ZTF
J153932.16+502738.8 is a significant source of gravitational radiation close to
the peak of LISA's sensitivity, and should be detected within the first week of
LISA observations.

Title:Synthetic tracking using ZTF Long Dwell Datasets,"
Abstract:  The Zwicky Transit Factory (ZTF) is a powerful time domain survey facility
with a large field of view. We apply the synthetic tracking technique to
integrate a ZTF's long-dwell dataset, which consists of 133 nominal 30-second
exposure frames spanning about 1.5 hours, to search for slowly moving asteroids
down to approximately 23rd magnitude. We found more than one thousand objects
from searching 40 CCD-quadrant subfields, each of which covers a field size of
$\sim$0.73 deg$^2$. While most of the objects are main belt asteroids, there
are asteroids belonging to families of Trojan, Hilda, Hungaria, Phocaea, and
near-Earth-asteroids. Such an approach is effective and productive. Here we

Title:Space Based Gravitational Wave Astronomy Beyond LISA,"
Abstract:  The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will open three decades of
gravitational wave (GW) spectrum between 0.1 and 100 mHz, the mHz band. This
band is expected to be the richest part of the GW spectrum, in types of
sources, numbers of sources, signal-to-noise ratios and discovery potential.
When LISA opens the low-frequency window of the gravitational wave spectrum,
around 2034, the surge of gravitational-wave astronomy will strongly compel a
subsequent mission to further explore the frequency bands of the GW spectrum
that can only be accessed from space. The 2020s is the time to start developing
technology and studying mission concepts for a large-scale mission to be
launched in the 2040s. The mission concept would then be proposed to Astro2030.
Only space based missions can access the GW spectrum between 10 nHz and 1 Hz
because of the Earths seismic noise. This white paper surveys the science in
this band and mission concepts that could accomplish that science. The proposed
small scale activity is a technology development program that would support a
range of concepts and a mission concept study to choose a specific mission
concept for Astro2030. In this white paper, we will refer to a generic GW
mission beyond LISA as bLISA.

Title:Model-independent constraints on the hydrogen-ionizing emissivity at z>6,"
Abstract:  Modelling reionization often requires significant assumptions about the
properties of ionizing sources. Here, we infer the total output of
hydrogen-ionizing photons (the ionizing emissivity, $\dot{N}_\textrm{ion}$) at
$z=4-14$ from current reionization constraints, being maximally agnostic to the
properties of ionizing sources. We use a Bayesian analysis to fit for a
non-parametric form of $\dot{N}_\textrm{ion}$, allowing us to flexibly explore
the entire prior volume. We infer a declining $\dot{N}_\textrm{ion}$ with
redshift at $z>6$, which can be used as a benchmark for reionization models.
Model-independent reionization constraints from the CMB optical depth and
Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ forest dark pixel fraction produce
$\dot{N}_\textrm{ion}$ evolution
($d\log_{10}\dot{N}_\textrm{ion}/dz|_{z=6\rightarrow8} = -0.31\pm0.35$ dex)
consistent with the declining UV luminosity density of galaxies, assuming
constant ionizing photon escape fraction and efficiency. Including measurements
from Ly$\alpha$ damping of galaxies and quasars produces a more rapid decline:
$d\log_{10}\dot{N}_\textrm{ion}/dz|_{z=6\rightarrow8} =-0.44\pm0.22$ dex,
steeper than the declining galaxy luminosity density (if extrapolated beyond
$M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim -13$), and constrains the mid-point of reionization to
$z = 6.93\pm0.14$.

Title:High order symplectic integrators for planetary dynamics and their implementation in REBOUND,"
Abstract:  Direct N-body simulations and symplectic integrators are effective tools to
study the long-term evolution of planetary systems. The Wisdom-Holman (WH)
integrator in particular has been used extensively in planetary dynamics as it
allows for large timesteps at good accuracy. One can extend the WH method to
achieve even higher accuracy using several different approaches. In this paper
we survey integrators developed by Wisdom et al. (1996), Laskar & Robutel
(2001, and Blanes et al. (2013). Since some of these methods are harder to
implement and not as readily available to astronomers compared to the standard
WH method, they are not used as often. This is somewhat unfortunate given that
in typical simulations it is possible to improve the accuracy by up to six
orders of magnitude (!) compared to the standard WH method without the need for
any additional force evaluations. To change this, we implement a variety of
high order symplectic methods in the freely available N-body integrator
REBOUND. In this paper we catalogue these methods, discuss their differences,
describe their error scalings, and benchmark their speed using our
implementations.

Title:Improving Galaxy Clustering Measurements with Deep Learning: analysis of the DECaLS DR7 data,"
Abstract:  Robust measurements of cosmological parameters from galaxy surveys rely on
our understanding of systematic effects that impact the observed galaxy density
field. In this paper we present, validate, and implement the idea of adopting
the systematics mitigation method of Artificial Neural Networks for modeling
the relationship between the target galaxy density field and various
observational realities including but not limited to Galactic extinction,
seeing, and stellar density. Our method by construction allows a wide class of
models and alleviates over-training by performing k-fold cross-validation and
dimensionality reduction via backward feature elimination. By permuting the
choice of the training, validation, and test sets, we construct a selection
mask for the entire footprint. We apply our method on the extended Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs)
selection from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) Data Release 7 and
show that the spurious large-scale contamination due to imaging systematics can
be significantly reduced by up-weighting the observed galaxy density using the
selection mask from the neural network and that our method is more effective
than the conventional linear and quadratic polynomial functions. We perform
extensive analyses on simulated mock datasets with and without systematic
effects. Our analyses indicate that our methodology is more robust to
overfitting compared to the conventional methods. This method can be utilized
in the catalog generation of future spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as eBOSS
and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to better mitigate
observational systematics.

Title:Strontium Iodide Radiation Instrument (SIRI) -- Early On-Orbit Results,"
Abstract:  The Strontium Iodide Radiation Instrument (SIRI) is a single detector,
gamma-ray spectrometer designed to space-qualify the new scintillation detector
material europium-doped strontium iodide (SrI2:Eu) and new silicon
photomultiplier (SiPM) technology. SIRI covers the energy range from 0.04-8 MeV
and was launched into 600 km sun-synchronous orbit on Dec 3, 2018 onboard
STPSat5 with a one-year mission to investigate the detector's response to
on-orbit background radiation. The detector has an active volume of 11.6 cm3
and a photo fraction efficiency of 50% at 662 keV for gamma-rays parallel to
the long axis of the crystal. Its spectroscopic resolution of 4.3% was measured
by the FWHM of the characteristic Cs-137 gamma-ray line at 662 keV. Measured
background rates external to the trapped particle regions are 40-50 counts per
second for energies greater than 40 keV and are largely the result of short-
and long-term activation products generated by transits of the SAA and the
continual cosmic-ray bombardment. Rate maps determined from energy cuts of the
collected spectral data show the expected contributions from the various
trapped particle regions. Early spectra acquired by the instrument show the
presence of at least 10 characteristic gamma-ray lines and a beta continuum
generated by activation products within the detector and surrounding materials.
As of April 2019, the instrument has acquired over 1000 hours of data and is
expected to continue operations until the space vehicle is decommissioned in
Dec. 2019. Results indicate SrI2:Eu provides a feasible alternative to
traditional sodium iodide and cesium iodide scintillators, especially for
missions where a factor-of-two improvement in energy resolution would represent
a significant difference in scientific return. To the best of our knowledge,
SIRI is the first on-orbit use of SrI2:Eu scintillator with SiPM readouts.

which is consistent with the Gaia DR2 result. Long-term detailed period
variation analysis of the system indicate a period decrease of

be on the red giant branch (RGB) and the hotter one to be still on the main
sequence.

Title:Forecast of Daily Major Flare Probability Using Relationships between Vector Magnetic Properties and Flaring Rates,"
Abstract:  We develop forecast models of daily probability of major flares (M- and
X-class) based on empirical relationships between photospheric magnetic
parameters and daily flaring rates from May 2010 to April 2018. In this study,
we consider ten magnetic parameters characterizing size, distribution, and
non-potentiality of vector magnetic fields from Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellites (GOES) X-ray flare data. The magnetic parameters are
classified into three types: the total unsigned parameters, the total signed
parameters, and the mean parameters. We divide the data into two sets
chronologically: 70% for training and 30% for testing. The empirical
relationships between the parameters and flaring rates are used to predict
flare occurrence probabilities for a given magnetic parameter value. Major
results of this study are as follows. First, major flare occurrence rates are
well correlated with ten parameters having correlation coefficients above 0.85.
Second, logarithmic values of flaring rates are well approximated by linear
equations. Third, the total unsigned and signed parameters achieved better
performance for predicting flares than the mean parameters in terms of
verification measures of probabilistic and converted binary forecasts. We
conclude that the total quantity of non-potentiality of magnetic fields is
crucial for flare forecasting among the magnetic parameters considered in this
study. When this model is applied for operational use, this model can be used
using the data of 21:00 TAI with a slight underestimation of 2 - 6.3%.

Title:The spectral index of polarized diffuse Galactic emission between 30 and 44 GHz,"
Abstract:  We present an estimate of the polarized spectral index between the Planck 30
and 44 GHz surveys in $3.7^\circ$ pixels across the entire sky. We use an
objective reference prior that maximises the impact of the data on the
posterior and multiply this by a maximum entropy prior that includes
information from observations in total intensity by assuming a polarization
fraction. Our parametrization of the problem allows the reference prior to be
easily determined and also provides a natural method of including prior
information. The spectral index map is consistent with those found by others
between surveys at similar frequencies. Across the entire sky we find an
average temperature spectral index of $-2.99\pm0.03(\pm1.12)$ where the first
error term is the statistical uncertainty on the mean and the second error term
(in parentheses) is the extra intrinsic scatter in the data. We use a
clustering algorithm to identify pixels with actual detections of the spectral
index. The average spectral index in these pixels is $-3.12\pm0.03(\pm0.64)$
and then when also excluding pixels within $10^\circ$ of the Galactic plane we
find $-2.92(\pm0.03)$. We find a statistically significant difference between
the average spectral indices in the North and South Fermi bubbles. Only
including pixels identified by the clustering algorithm, the average spectral
index in the southern bubble is $-3.00\pm0.05(\pm0.35)$, which is similar to
the average across the whole sky. In the northern bubble we find a much harder
average spectral index of $-2.36\pm0.09(\pm0.63)$. Therefore, if the bubbles
are features in microwave polarization they are not symmetric about the
Galactic plane.

Title:Populations of stellar mass Black holes from binary systems,"
Abstract:  In large and complicated stellar systems like galaxies it is difficult to
predict the number and characteristics of a black hole population. Such
populations may be modelled as an aggregation of homogeneous (i.e. having
uniform star formation history and the same initial chemical composition)
stellar populations. Using realistic evolutionary models we predict the
abundances and properties of black holes formed from binaries in these
environments. We show that the black hole population will be dominated by
single black holes originating from binary disruptions and stellar mergers.
Furthermore, we discuss how black hole populations are influenced by such
factors as initial parameters, metallicity, initial mass function, and natal
kick models. As an example application of our results, we estimate that about
26 microlensing events to happen every year in the direction of the Galactic
Bulge due to black holes in a survey like OGLE-IV. Our results may be used to
perform in-depth studies related to realistic black hole populations, e.g.
observational predictions for space survey missions like Gaia, or Einstein
Probe. We prepared a publicly available database with the raw data from our
simulations to be used for more in-depth studies.

Title:Intrinsic GeV-TeV gamma-ray emission from EHSP blazars,"
Abstract:  Extremely High Synchrotron Peak (EHSP) blazars are observed to form a small
population of sources with high energy hump peaking at TeV energies in their
broad-band spectral energy distributions. The observed gamma-ray emission from
these sources at GeV-TeV energies is described by unusual hard spectral
indices. The observed spectral and temporal characteristics of these sources
challenge the standard leptonic models for the broad-band emissions from
blazars. Therefore, such sources provide astrophysical sites to investigate
directly the particle acceleration, cooling of relativistic particles and
indirectly probe the cosmological quantities like extragalactic background
light (EBL) and intergalactic magnetic field (IMF) in the Universe. In this
study, we investigate the spectral properties of the gamma-ray emission from
EHSP blazars using observations from the Fermi-LAT catalogues (3FGL and 3FHL)
along with the TeV observations using ground based telescopes. The observed TeV
gamma-ray spectra are corrected for the EBL absorption using the most recent
and updated EBL models to determine the intrinsic spectrum at the source. The
intrinsic TeV spectra are combined with the MeV-GeV observations from the
Fermi-LAT to study the gamma-ray emission from EHSP blazars in the broad energy
band. The intrinsic gamma-ray spectra are then used to estimate the position of
high energy peak in the spectral energy distribution. We also present the
qualitative description for the observed spectral properties of EHSP blazars
using different physical scenarios and discuss their importance for the
upcoming CTA observatory.

Abstract:  Jupiter Trojan asteroids are minor bodies that share Jupiter's orbit around

surface properties that, besides being comparable with other populations of
small bodies in the Solar System, hold information that may restrict models of
planetary formation. Due their importance, there has been a significant
increase in an interest in studying this population. In this context arises the
NASA Lucy Mission, with a planned launch of 2021. The Lucy Mission will be the
first one to address a group of 6 objects with the aim of investigating, in
detail, their nature. In order to provide valuable information for mission
planning and maximize the scientific return, we carried out ground based
observations of four targets of the mission. Aimed at looking for variabilities
on the spectra of (3548) Eurybates, (15094) Polymele and (21900) Orus, we
performed rotationally resolved visible spectroscopy of them at SOAR Telescope.
We also analyzed the first visible spectrum obtained for the main belt asteroid
(52246) Donaldjohanson at Gran Telescopio Canarias. The spectra of Orus and
Polymele present rather homogeneous characteristics along the surfaces, and
their taxa correspond with those of the two dominant populations in the Trojan
population, the P- and the D-type group of objects. Spectroscopy of Eurybates,
on the other side, suggests that some variation on the characteristics of the
reflectance of this body could be related with its collisional history.
Donaldjohanson, the only main belt object in the group of targets, shows,
according to our visible spectrum, hints of the presence of hydrated materials.
Lucy mission will investigate the surface composition of these targets and will
shed light on their connections with other minor bodies populations and in
their role on the evolution of the Solar System.

Title:X-ray fluorescence from super-Eddington accreting black holes,"
Abstract:  X-ray reverberation has proven to be a powerful tool capable of probing the
innermost region of accretion disks around compact objects. Current theoretical
effort generally assumes that the disk is geometrically thin, optically thick
and orbiting with Keplerian speed. Thus, these models cannot be applied to
systems where super-Eddington accretion happens because the thin disk
approximation fails in this accretion regime. Furthermore, state-of-the-art
numerical simulations show that optically thick winds are launched from the
super-Eddington accretion disks, and thereby changing the reflection geometry
significantly from the thin disk picture. We carry out theoretical
investigations on this topic by focusing on the Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent lines
produced from super-Eddington disks, and show that their line profiles are
shaped by the funnel geometry and wind acceleration. We also systematically
compare the Fe line profiles from super-Eddington thick disks to those from
thin disks, and find that the former are substantially more blueshifted and
symmetric in shape. These results are consistent with the observed Fe K$\alpha$
line from the jetted tidal disruption event, Swift J1644, in which a transient
super-Eddington accretion disk was formed out of stellar debris. Therefore,
careful analysis of the Fe K$\alpha$ line profile can be used to identify
systems undergoing super-Eddington accretion.

Far-ultraviolet (FUV) to Far-infrared (FIR) emission of a population of Lyman
break galaxies (LBGs) at $z\sim3$ that cannot be individually detected from
current FIR observations. We perform a stacking analysis over a sample of
$\sim$17000 LBGs at redshift $2.5<z<3.5$ in the COSMOS field. The sample is
binned as a function of UV luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{FUV}}$), UV continuum slope
($\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$), and stellar mass (M$_{*}$), and then, stacked at
optical ($BVriz$ bands), near-infrared ($YJHKs$ bands), IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.6 and
8.0 $\mu$m), MIPS (24$\mu$m), PACS (100 and 160~$\mu$m), SPIRE (250, 350, and
500~$\mu$m), and AzTEC (1.1mm) observations. We obtain thirty rest-frame
FUV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SEDs) of LBGs at $z\sim3$, and analyse
them with CIGALE SED-fitting analysis code. We are able to derive fully
consistent physical parameters (M$_{*}$, $\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$,
$L_{\mathrm{FUV}}$, $L_{\mathrm{IR}}$, A$_{FUV}$, SFR, and slope of the dust
attenuation law), and build a semi-empirical library of thirty rest-frame
FUV-to-FIR stacked LBG SEDs as a function of $L_{\mathrm{FUV}}$,
$\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$, and M$_{*}$. We used the so-called IR-excess ($IRX
\equiv L_{\mathrm{IR}} / L_{\mathrm{FUV}}$) to investigate the dust attenuation
as a function of $\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$ and M$_{*}$. Additionally, the
SED-fitting analysis results provide a diversity of dust attenuation curve
along the LBG sample, and their slope are well correlated with M$_{*}$. Stepper
dust attenuations curves than Calzetti's are favoured in low stellar mass LBGs
($\log(M_{*} [M_{\odot}]) < 10.25$), while grayer ones are favoured in high
stellar mass LBGs ($\log(M_{*} [M_{\odot}]) > 10.25$).

Title:Broadband spectroscopy of astrophysical ice analogs. I. Direct measurement of complex refractive index of CO ice using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  Context: Reliable, directly measured optical properties of astrophysical ice
analogs in the infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) range are missing. These
parameters are of great importance to model the dust continuum radiative
transfer in dense and cold regions, here thick ice mantles are present, and are
necessary for the interpretation of future observations planned in the far-IR
region. Aims: Coherent THz radiation allows direct measurement of the complex
dielectric function (refractive index) of astrophysically relevant ice species
in the THz range. Methods: The time-domain waveforms and the frequency-domain
spectra of reference samples of CO ice, deposited at a temperature of 28.5 K
and annealed to 33 K at different thicknesses, have been recorded. A new
algorithm is developed to reconstruct the real and imaginary parts of the
refractive index from the time-domain THz data. Results: The complex refractive
index in the wavelength range of 1 mm - 150 ${\mu}$m (0.3 - 2.0 THz) has been
determined for the studied ice samples, and compared with available data found
in the literature. Conclusions: The developed algorithm of reconstructing the
real and imaginary parts of the refractive index from the time-domain THz data
enables, for the first time, the determination of optical properties of
astrophysical ice analogs without using the Kramers-Kronig relations. The
obtained data provide a benchmark to interpret the observational data from
current ground based facilities as well as future space telescope missions, and
have been used to estimate the opacities of the dust grains in presence of CO

Title:Gas Inflow and Star Formation near Supermassive Black Holes: The Role of Nuclear Activity,"
Abstract:  Numerical models of gas inflow towards a supermassive black hole (SMBH) show
that star formation may occur in such an environment through the growth of a
gravitationally unstable gas disc. We consider the effect of nuclear activity
on such a scenario. We present the first three-dimensional grid-based radiative
hydrodynamic simulations of direct collisions between infalling gas streams and
a $4 \times 10^6~\text{M}_\odot$ SMBH, using ray-tracing to incorporate
radiation consistent with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We assume inflow
masses of $ \approx 10^5~\text{M}_\odot$ and explore radiation fields of 10%
and 100% of the Eddington luminosity ($L_\text{edd}$). We follow our models to
the point of central gas disc formation preceding star formation and use the
Toomre Q parameter ($Q_T$) to test for gravitational instability. We find that
radiation pressure from UV photons inhibits inflow. Yet, for weak radiation
fields, a central disc forms on timescales similar to that of models without
feedback. Average densities of $> 10^{8}~\text{cm}^{-3}$ limit photo-heating to
the disc surface allowing for $Q_T\approx1$. For strong radiation fields, the
disc forms more gradually resulting in lower surface densities and larger $Q_T$
values. Mass accretion rates in our models are consistent with 1%--60% of the
Eddington limit, thus we conclude that it is unlikely that radiative feedback
from AGN activity would inhibit circumnuclear star formation arising from a
massive inflow event.

Title:OGLE-2015-BLG-1649Lb: A gas giant planet around a low-mass dwarf,"
Abstract:  We report the discovery of an exoplanet in microlensing event
OGLE-2015-BLG-1649. The planet/host-star mass ratio is $q =7.2 \times 10^{-3}$
and the projected separation normalized by the Einstein radius is $s = 0.9$.
The upper limit of the lens flux is obtained from adaptive optics observations
by IRCS/Subaru, which excludes the probability of a G-dwarf or more massive
host star and helps to put a tighter constraint on the lens mass as well as
commenting on the formation scenarios of giant planets orbiting low-mass stars.
We conduct a Bayesian analysis including constraints on the lens flux to derive
the probability distribution of the physical parameters of the lens system. We
thereby find that the masses of the host star and planet are $M_{L} = 0.34 \pm
0.19 M_{\odot}$ and $M_{p} = 2.5^{+1.5}_{-1.4} M_{Jup}$, respectively. The
distance to the system is $D_{L} = 4.23^{+1.51}_{-1.64}$kpc. The projected
star-planet separation is $a_{\perp} = 2.07^{+0.65}_{-0.77}$AU. The lens-source
relative proper motion of the event is quite high, at $\sim 7.1 \, {\rm
mas/yr}$. Therefore, we may be able to determine the lens physical parameters
uniquely or place much stronger constraints on them by measuring the
color-dependent centroid shift and/or the image elongation with additional high
resolution imaging already a few years from now.

Title:Updating the theoretical tidal evolution constants: Apsidal motion and the moment of inertia,"
Abstract:  The theoretical apsidal motion constants are key tools to investigate the
stellar interiors in close eccentric binary systems. In addition, these
constants and the moment of inertia are also important to investigate the tidal
evolution of close binary stars as well as of exo-planetary systems.
The aim of the paper is to present new evolutionary models, based on the MESA
package, that include the internal structure constants (k$_2$, k$_3$, and
k$_4$), the radius of gyration, and the gravitational potential energy for
configurations computed from the pre-main-sequence (PMS) up to the first ascent
giant branch or beyond. The calculations are available for the three
metallicities [Fe/H]= 0.00, -0.50, and -1.00, which take the recent
investigations in less metallic environments into account. This new set of
models replaces the old ones, published about 15 years ago, using the code
GRANADA.
Core overshooting was taken into account using the mass-f$_{ov}$
relationship, which was derived semi-empirically for models more massive than
1.2 M$_{\odot}$. The differential equations governing the apsidal motion
constants, moment of inertia, and the gravitational potential energy were
integrated simultaneously through a fifth-order Runge-Kutta method with a
tolerance level of 10$^{-7}$.
The resulting models (from 0.8 up to 35.0 M$_{\odot}$) are presented in 54
tables for the three metallicities, containing the usual characteristics of an
evolutionary model (age, initial masses, log T$_{\rm eff}$, log g, and log L),
the constants of internal structure (k$_2$, k$_3$, and k$_4$), the radius of
gyration $\beta,$ and the factor $\alpha$ that is related with the
gravitational potential energy.

Title:X-ray emission in the enigmatic CVSO 30 system,"
Abstract:  CVSO 30 is a young, active, weak-line T Tauri star; it possibly hosts the
only known planetary system with both a transiting hot-Jupiter and a
cold-Jupiter candidate (CVSO 30 b and c). We analyzed archival ROSAT, Chandra,
and XMM-Newton data to study the coronal emission in the system. According to
our modeling, CVSO 30 shows a quiescent X-ray luminosity of about 8e29 erg/s.
The X-ray absorbing column is consistent with interstellar absorption.
XMM-Newton observed a flare, during which a transit of the candidate CVSO 30 b
was expected, but no significant transit-induced variation in the X-ray flux is
detectable. While the hot-Jupiter candidate CVSO 30 b has continuously been
undergoing mass loss powered by the high-energy irradiation, we conclude that
its evaporation lifetime is considerably longer than the estimated stellar age
of 2.6 Myr.

Title:Self-consistent Modelling of Gamma-Ray Spectra from Solar Flares with the Monte Carlo Simulation Package FLUKA,"
Abstract:  We use the Monte Carlo particle physics code FLUKA (Fluktuierende Kaskade) to
calculate $\gamma$-ray spectra expected from solar flare energetic ion
distributions. The FLUKA code includes robust physics-based models for
electromagnetic, hadronic and nuclear interactions, sufficiently detailed for
it to be a useful tool for calculating nuclear de-excitation, positron
annihilation and neutron capture line fluxes and shapes, as well as $\approx \;
{\rm GeV}$ continuum radiation from pion decay products. We show nuclear
de-excitation $\gamma$-ray line model spectra from a range of assumed primary
accelerated ion distributions and find them to be in good agreement with those
found using the code of Murphy et al. (2009). We also show full $\gamma$-ray
model spectra which exhibit all the typical structures of $\gamma$-ray spectra
observed in solar flares. From these model spectra we build templates which are
incorporated into the software package Objective Spectral Executive (OSPEX) and
used to fit the combined Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)/Large Area
Telescope (LAT) spectrum of the 2010 June 12 solar flare, providing a
statistically acceptable result. To the best of our knowledge, the fit carried
out with the FLUKA templates for the full $\gamma$-ray spectrum can be regarded
as the first attempt to use a single code to implement a self-consistent
treatment of the several spectral components in the photon energy range from
$\approx 100$s ${\rm keV}$ to $\approx 100$s ${\rm MeV}$.

Title:Resolved scaling relations and metallicity gradients on sub-kiloparsec scales at z=1,"
Abstract:  The existence of a spatially resolved Star-Forming Main Sequence (rSFMS) and
a spatially resolved Mass-Metallicity Relation (rMZR) is now well established
for local galaxies. Moreover, gradients with metallicity decreasing with radius
seem to be common in local disc galaxies. These observations suggest that
galaxy formation is a self-regulating process, and provide constraints for
galaxy evolution models. Studying the evolution of these relations at higher
redshifts is still however very challenging. In this paper, we analyse three
gravitationally lensed galaxies at z = 0.6, 0.7 and 1, observed with MUSE and
SINFONI. These galaxies are highly magnified by galaxy clusters, which allow us
to observe resolved scaling relations and metallicity gradients on physical
scales of a couple of hundred parsecs, comparable to studies of local galaxies.
We confirm that the rSFMS is already in place at these redshifts on sub-kpc
scales, and establish, for the first time, the existence of the rMZR at higher
redshifts. We develop a forward-modelling approach to fit 2D metallicity
gradients of multiply imaged lensed galaxies in the image plane, and derive
gradients of -0.027+/-0.003, -0.019+/-0.003 and -0.039+/-0.060 dex/kpc. Despite
the fact that these are clumpy galaxies, typical of high redshift discs, the
metallicity variations in the galaxies are well described by global linear
gradients, and we do not see any difference in metallicity associated with the
star-forming clumps.

Title:Simultaneous 22 GHz Water and 44 GHz Methanol Masers Survey of Ultracompact HII Regions,"
Abstract:  We have carried out a multi-epoch simultaneous survey of 22 GHz H$_2$O and 44
GHz Class I CH$_3$OH masers toward 103 ultracompact HII regions (UCHIIs)
between 2010 and 2017. We detected H$_2$O and CH$_3$OH maser emission in 74
(72%) and 55 (53%) UCHIIs, respectively. Among them, 3 H$_2$O and 27 CH$_3$OH
maser sources are new detections. These high detection rates suggest that the
occurrence periods of both maser species are significantly overlapped with the
UCHII phase of massive star formation. The CH$_3$OH maser lines always have
small (< 10 km s$^{-1}$) relative velocities with respect to the natal
molecular cores, while H$_2$O maser lines often show larger relative
velocities. Twenty four H$_2$O maser-detected sources have maser lines at
relative velocities > 30 km s$^{-1}$, and thirteen of them show extremely
high-velocity (> 50 km s$^{-1}$) components. The appearance and disappearance
of H$_2$O maser lines are quite frequent over six-month or one-year time
intervals. In contrast, CH$_3$OH maser lines usually do not exhibit significant
variations in the line intensity, velocity, or shape for the same periods. The
isotropic luminosities of both masers appear to correlate with the bolometric
luminosities of the central stars. This correlation becomes much stronger in
the case that data points in the low- and intermediate-mass regimes are added.
The maser luminosities also tend to increase with the radio continuum
luminosities of UCHIIs and the submillimeter continuum luminosities of the
associated dense cores.

Title:The BAO+BBN take on the Hubble tension,"
Abstract:  Many attempts to solve the Hubble tension with extended cosmological models
combine an enhanced relic radiation density, acting at the level of background
cosmology, with new physical ingredients affecting the evolution of
cosmological perturbations. Several authors have pointed out the ability of
combined Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)
data to probe the background cosmological history independently of both CMB
maps and supernovae data. Using state-of-the-art assumptions on BBN, we confirm
that combined BAO, deuterium, and helium data are in tension with the SH0ES
measurements under the $\Lambda$CDM assumption at the 3.2$\sigma$ level, while
being in close agreement with the CMB value. We subsequently show that floating
the radiation density parameter $N_\mathrm{eff}$ only reduces the tension down
to the 2.6$\sigma$ level. This conclusion, totally independent of any CMB data,
shows that a high $N_\mathrm{eff}$ accounting for extra relics (either
free-streaming or self-interacting) does not provide an obvious solution to the
crisis, not even at the level of background cosmology. To circumvent this
strong bound, (i) the extra radiation has to be generated after BBN to avoid
helium bounds, and (ii) additional ingredients have to be invoked at the level
of perturbations to reconcile this extra radiation with CMB and LSS data.

Title:Label Switching Problem in Bayesian Analysis for Gravitational Wave Astronomy,"
Abstract:  The label switching problem arises in the Bayesian analysis of models
containing multiple indistinguishable parameters with arbitrary ordering. Any
permutation of these parameters is equivalent, therefore models with many such
parameters have extremely multi-modal posterior distributions. It is difficult
to sample efficiently from such posteriors. This paper discusses a solution to
this problem which involves carefully mapping the input parameter space to a
high dimensional hypertriangle. It is demonstrated that this solution is
efficient even for large numbers of parameters and can be easily applied
alongside any stochastic sampling algorithm. This method is illustrated using
two example problems from the field of gravitational wave astronomy.

Title:The C-Band All-Sky Survey (C-BASS): Simulated parametric fitting in single pixels in total intensity and polarization,"
Abstract:  The cosmic microwave background $B$-mode signal is potentially weaker than
the diffuse Galactic foregrounds over most of the sky at any frequency. A
common method of separating the CMB from these foregrounds is via pixel-based
parametric-model fitting. There are not currently enough all-sky maps to fit
anything more than the most simple models of the sky. By simulating the
emission in seven representative pixels, we demonstrate that the inclusion of a
5 GHz data point allows for more complex models of low-frequency foregrounds to
be fitted than at present. It is shown that the inclusion of the CBASS data
will significantly reduce the uncertainties in a number of key parameters in
the modelling of both the galactic foregrounds and the CMB. The extra data
allow estimates of the synchrotron spectral index to be constrained much more
strongly than is presently possible, with corresponding improvements in the
accuracy of the recovery of the CMB amplitude. However, we show that to place
good limits on models of the synchrotron spectral curvature will require
additional low-frequency data.

Title:Exact analytical expression for the synchrotron radiation spectrum in the Gaussian turbulent magnetic field,"
Abstract:  We demonstrate that the exact solution for the spectrum of synchrotron
radiation from an isotropic population of mono-energetic electrons in turbulent
magnetic field with Gaussian distribution of local field strengths can be
expressed in the simple analytic form: $\left( \frac{{\rm d} \dot{N}}{{\rm d}
\omega} \right)_t
= \frac{\alpha}{3} \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x^{2/3}} \right)
\exp \left( - 2 x^{2/3} \right)$, where $x = \frac{\omega}{\omega_0}\, ;
\omega_0 = \frac{4}{3} \gamma^2 \frac{eB_0}{m_e c}\, .$ We use this expression
to find approximate synchrotron spectra for power-law electron distributions
with $\propto \exp\left( -\left[ \gamma/\gamma_0 \right]^\beta\right)$ type
high-energy cut-off; the resulting synchrotron spectrum has the exponential
cut-off factor with frequency raised to $2\beta/(3\beta+4)$ power in the
exponent. For the power-law electron distribution without high-energy cut-off,
we find the coefficient $a_m$ as a function of the power-law index, which
results in exact expression for the synchrotron spectrum when using
monochromatic (i.e., each electron radiates at frequency $\omega_m = a_m
\gamma^2 \, \frac{e B_0}{m_e c}$) approximation.

Abstract:  We present the results of a search for Galactic Beta Cephei stars, which are

the optical light curves of known O- and B-type stars with data from the KELT
exoplanet survey. We identify 113 Beta Cephei stars, of which 86 are new
discoveries, which altogether represents a ~70% increase in the number
presently known. An additional 96 candidates are identified. Among our targets,
we find five new eclipsing binaries and 22 stars with equal frequency spacings
suggestive of rotational splitting of nonradial pulsation modes. Candidates for
runaway stars among our targets and a number of interesting individual objects
are discussed. Most of the known and newly discovered Beta Cephei stars will be
observed by the TESS mission, providing by far the most comprehensive
observational data set of massive main sequence pulsating stars of sufficient
quality for detailed asteroseismic studies. Future analysis of these light
curves has the potential to dramatically increase our understanding of the
structure of stellar interiors and the physical processes taking place therein.

Abstract:  We set conservative constraints on decaying dark matter particles with masses
spanning a very wide range ($10^4-10^{16}$ GeV). For this we use multimessenger
observations of cosmic-ray (CR) protons/antiprotons, electrons/positrons,
neutrinos/antineutrinos and gamma rays. Focusing on decays into the $\bar{b}b$
channel, we simulate the spectra of dark matter yields by using the
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi equations and the $\texttt{Pythia}$
package. We then propagate the CRs of dark matter origin till Earth by using
the state-of-the-art numerical frameworks $\texttt{CRPropa}$,
$\texttt{GALPROP}$ and $\texttt{HelMod}$ for the solution of the CR transport
equation in the extragalactic, Galactic region and the heliosphere,
respectively. Conservative limits are obtained by requiring that the predicted
dark matter spectra at Earth be less than the observed CR spectra. Overall, we
exclude dark matter lifetimes of $10^{28}$ s or shorter for all the masses
investigated in this work. The most stringent constraints reach $10^{30}$ s for
very heavy dark matter particles with masses in the range $10^{11}-10^{14}$

Title:Investing for Discovery in Astronomy,"
Abstract:  How should we invest our available resources to best sustain astronomy's
track record of discovery, established over the past few decades? Two strong
hints come from (1) our history of astronomical discoveries and (2) literature
citation patterns that reveal how discovery and development activities in
science are strong functions of team size. These argue that progress in
astronomy hinges on support for a diversity of research efforts in terms of
team size, research tools and platforms, and investment strategies that
encourage risk taking.
These ideas also encourage us to examine the implications of the trend toward
""big team science"" and ""survey science"" in astronomy over the past few decades,
and to reconsider the common assumption that progress in astronomy always means
""trading up"" to bigger apertures and facilities. Instead, the considerations
above argue that we need a balanced set of investments in small- to large-scale
initiatives and team sizes both large and small. Large teams tend to develop
existing ideas, whereas small teams are more likely to fuel the future with
disruptive discoveries. While large facilities are the ""value"" investments that
are guaranteed to produce discoveries, smaller facilities are the ""growth
stocks"" that are likely to deliver the biggest science bang per buck, sometimes
with outsize returns. One way to foster the risk taking that fuels discovery is
to increase observing opportunity, i.e., create more observing nights and
facilitate the exploration of science-ready data.

Aims: We identify the ground-state OH masers at 18cm wavelength in the area

present a catalogue of all OH maser features and their possible associated
environments. Methods: The THOR survey covers longitude and latitude ranges of

1720MHz have been observed, employing the Very Large Array. The spatial
resolution of the data varies between 12.5'' and 19'', the spectral resolution
is 1.5km/s, and the rms sensitivity of the data is ~10mJy/beam per channel.
Results: We identify 1585 individual maser spots distributed over 807 maser
sites. Based on different criteria from spectral profiles to literature
comparison, we try to associate the maser sites with astrophysical source
types. Approximately 51\% of the sites exhibit the double-horned 1612MHz
spectra typically emitted from the expanding shells of evolved stars. The
separations of the two main velocity features of the expanding shells typically
vary between 22 and 38km/s. In addition to this, at least 20% of the maser
sites are associated with star-forming regions. While the largest fraction of
1720MHz maser spots (21 out of 53) is associated with supernova remnants, a
significant fraction of the 1720MHz maser spots (17) are also associated with
star-forming regions. We present comparisons to the thermal 13CO(1-0) emission

Title:Fragmentation in Population III Galaxies formed through Ionizing Radiation,"
Abstract:  Population III stars forming in minihalos tend to be relatively inefficient,
with each minihalo hosting one or a small number of stars which are more
massive than local stars but still challenging to observe directly at high
redshift. Here we explore a possible mechanisms for the generation of larger
clusters of such stars: a nearby ionizing source which ionizes a late forming
halo, delaying its collapse until the halo is sufficiently large that the core
can self-shield and suffer runaway collapse. We use simulations with a simple
but accurate model for the radiative ionizing flux and confirm the basic
predictions of previous work: higher ionizing fluxes can delay the collapse to
lower redshifts and higher masses, up to an order of magnitude above the atomic
cooling limit. In a limited number of runs we also examine the fragmentation of
the cores at even higher resolution, using both simple estimates and sink
particles to show that the number of fragments is generally small, at most a
handful, and that the mass accretion rate on the fragments is of order
$10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is sufficiently high that the descent
on the main sequence (and hence the suppression of accretion) is delayed until
the stellar masses are of order $100-1000$ M$_\odot$, but not high enough to
produce direct collapse black holes of mass $\sim 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$. The
resulting clusters are larger than those produced in minihalos, but are still
likely to fall short of being easily detectable in JWST blind fields.

Abstract:  We present the serendipitous discovery of the fastest Main Sequence
hyper-velocity star (HVS) by the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey

distance of $\sim 9$ kpc from the Sun and has a heliocentric radial velocity of
$1017\pm 2.7$ km/s without any signature of velocity variability. The current
3-D velocity of the star in the Galactic frame is $1755\pm50$ km/s. When
integrated backwards in time, the orbit of the star points unambiguously to the
Galactic Centre, implying that S5-HVS1 was kicked away from Sgr A* with a
velocity of $\sim 1800$ km/s and travelled for $4.8$ Myr to its current
location. This is so far the only HVS confidently associated with the Galactic
Centre. S5-HVS1 is also the first hyper-velocity star to provide constraints on
the geometry and kinematics of the Galaxy, such as the Solar motion
$V_{y,\odot}= 246.1\pm 5.3$ km/s or position $R_0=8.12\pm 0.23$ kpc. The
ejection trajectory and transit time of S5-HVS1 coincide with the orbital plane
and age of the annular disk of young stars at the Galactic centre, and thus may
be linked to its formation. With the S5-HVS1 ejection velocity being almost
twice the velocity of other hyper-velocity stars previously associated with the
Galactic Centre, we question whether they have been generated by the same
mechanism or whether the ejection velocity distribution has been constant over
time.

Title:A model for core formation in dark matter haloes and ultra diffuse galaxies by outflow episodes,"
Abstract:  We present a simple model for the response of a dissipationless spherical
system to an instantaneous mass change at its center, describing the formation
of flat cores in dark matter haloes and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) from
feedback-driven outflow episodes in a specific mass range. This model
generalizes an earlier simplified analysis of an isolated shell into a system
with continuous density, velocity and potential profiles. The response is
divided into an instantaneous change of potential at constant velocities due to
a given mass loss or gain, followed by energy-conserving relaxation to a new
Jeans equilibrium. The halo profile is modeled by a two-parameter function with
a variable inner slope and an analytic potential profile (Dekel et al. 2017),
which enables determining the associated kinetic energy at equilibrium. The
model is tested against NIHAO cosmological zoom-in simulations, where it
successfully predicts the evolution of the inner dark-matter profile between
successive snapshots in about 75% of the cases, failing mainly in merger
situations. This model provides a simple understanding of the formation of
dark-matter halo cores and UDGs by supernova-driven outflows, and a useful
analytic tool for studying such processes.

early times and quadrupole structure at late times. Together with the magnetic
pitch angle and the dynamo control parameters $R_{\alpha}$, $R_{\omega}$ and
$D$ we present strong evidence for an $\alpha^2$-$\Omega$ dynamo. The formation
of a bar in the centre leads to further amplification of the magnetic field via
adiabatic compression which subsequently drives an outflow. Due to the
Parker-Instability the magnetic field lines rise to the edge of the disc, break
out and expand freely in the CGM driven by the magnetic pressure. Finally, we
investigate the correlation between magnetic field and star formation rate.
Globally, we find that the magnetic field is increasing as function of the star
formation rate surface density with a slope between $0.3$ and $0.45$ in good
agreement with predictions from theory and observations. Locally, we find that
the magnetic field can decrease while star formation increases. We find that
this effect is correlated with the diffusion of magnetic field from the spiral
arms to the inter-arm regions which we explicitly include by solving the
induction equation and accounting for non-linear terms.

Title:Luminosity-duration relation of fast radio bursts,"
Abstract:  Nature of dark energy remains unknown. Especially, to constrain the time
variability of the dark-energy, a new, standardisable candle that can reach
more distant Universe has been awaited. Here we propose a new distance measure
using fast radio bursts (FRBs), which are a new emerging population of $\sim$
ms time scale radio bursts that can reach high-$z$ in quantity. We show an
empirical positive correlation between the time-integrated luminosity
(L$_{\nu}$) and rest-frame intrinsic duration ($w_{\rm int,rest}$) of FRBs. The
L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ correlation is with a weak strength but
statistically very significant, i.e., Pearson coefficient is $\sim$ 0.5 with
p-value of $\sim$0.038, despite the smallness of the current sample. This
correlation can be used to measure intrinsic luminosity of FRBs from the
observed $w_{\rm int,rest}$. By comparing the luminosity with observed flux, we
measure luminosity distances to FRBs, and thereby construct the Hubble diagram.
This FRB cosmology with the L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ relation has several
advantages over SNe Ia, Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), and well-known FRB dispersion
measure (DM)-$z$ cosmology; (i) access to higher redshift Universe beyond the
SNe Ia, (ii) high event rate that is $\sim$ 3 order of magnitude more frequent
than GRBs, and (iii) it is free from the uncertainty from intergalactic
electron density models, i.e., we can remove the largest uncertainty in the
well-debated DM-$z$ cosmology of FRB. Our simulation suggests that the
L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ relation provides us with useful constraints on the
time variability of the dark energy when the next generation radio telescopes
start to find FRBs in quantity.

Title:Quantifying the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect and Excess Millimeter Emission in Quasar Environments,"
Abstract:  In this paper we probe the hot, post-shock gas component of quasar-driven
winds through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Combining datasets
from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the $\textit{Herschel}$ Space
Observatory, and the Very Large Array, we measure average spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of 109,829 optically-selected, radio quiet quasars from
1.4~GHz to 3000~GHz in six redshift bins between $0.3<z<3.5$. We model the
emission components in the radio and far-infrared, plus a spectral distortion
from the tSZ effect. At $z>1.91$, we measure the tSZ effect at $3.8\sigma$
significance with an amplitude corresponding to a total thermal energy of
$3.1\times10^{60}$ ergs. If this energy is due to virialized gas, then our
measurement implies quasar host halo masses are
$\sim6\times10^{12}~h^{-1}$M$_\odot$. Alternatively, if the host dark matter
halo masses are $\sim2\times10^{12}~h^{-1}$M$_\odot$ as some measurements
suggest, then we measure a $>$90 per cent excess in the thermal energy over
that expected due to virialization. If the measured SZ effect is primarily due
to hot bubbles from quasar-driven winds, we find that $(5^{+1.2}_{-1.3}$) per
cent of the quasar bolometric luminosity couples to the intergalactic medium
over a fiducial quasar lifetime of 100 Myr. An additional source of tSZ may be
correlated structure, and further work is required to separate the
contributions. At $z\leq1.91$, we detect emission at 95 and 148~GHz that is in
excess of thermal dust and optically thin synchrotron emission. We investigate
potential sources of this excess emission, finding that CO line emission and an
additional optically thick synchrotron component are the most viable
candidates.

Title:Dark matter haloes and subhaloes,"
Abstract:  The development of methods and algorithms to solve the $N$-body problem for
classical, collisionless, non-relativistic particles has made it possible to
follow the growth and evolution of cosmic dark matter structures over most of
the Universe's history. In the best studied case $-$ the cold dark matter or
CDM model $-$ the dark matter is assumed to consist of elementary particles
that had negligible thermal velocities at early times. Progress over the past
three decades has led to a nearly complete description of the assembly,
structure and spatial distribution of dark matter haloes, and their
substructure in this model, over almost the entire mass range of astronomical
objects. On scales of galaxies and above, predictions from this standard CDM
model have been shown to provide a remarkably good match to a wide variety of
astronomical data over a large range of epochs, from the temperature structure
of the cosmic background radiation to the large-scale distribution of galaxies.
The frontier in this field has shifted to the relatively unexplored subgalactic
scales, the domain of the central regions of massive haloes, and that of
low-mass haloes and subhaloes, where potentially fundamental questions remain.
Answering them may require: (i) the effect of known but uncertain baryonic
processes (involving gas and stars), and/or (ii) alternative models with new
dark matter physics. Here we present a review of the field, focusing on our
current understanding of dark matter structure from $N$-body simulations and on
the challenges ahead.

Title:Soft and hard X-ray dips in the light curves of gamma Cassiopeiae,"
Abstract:  We have examined soft (<2keV) ""dips"" in six archival XMM-Newton observations
of gamma Cas (B0.5IV e) for ""soft dips"" (< 2keV) in X-ray light curves. We find
that such events are sometimes accompanied by minor, near-simultaneous dips in
the hard X-ray band. We investigate how these occurrences can be understood in
the ""magnetic star-disk interaction"" X-ray generation hypothesis. The soft
X-ray dips are interpreted as transits by dense X-ray-absorbing blobs moving
across sightlines to the Be star. These blobs have similar properties as the
""cloudlets"" responsible for migrating subfeatures in UV and optical spectral
lines and therefore may be part of a common distribution of co-rotating
occulters. The frequencies, amplitudes, and longevities of these dips vary
widely. A spectrum from 2014 July suggest that ""warm"" (kT = 0.6-4keV) plasma
sources are much more widely spread over the Be star's surface than the hot
plasma sites that dominate the flux at all X-ray energies. We call attention to
a sudden drop in all X-ray energies of the 2014 light curve of gamma Cas and a
similar sudden drop in a light curve of the analog HD110432. We speculate that
these could be related to strong soft X-ray dips several hours earlier.

"Title:First ALMA Millimeter Wavelength Maps of Jupiter, with a Multi-Wavelength Study of Convection","
Abstract:  We obtained the first maps of Jupiter at 1-3 mm wavelength with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) on 3-5 January 2017, just days
after an energetic eruption at 16.5S jovigraphic latitude had been reported by
the amateur community, and about 2-3 months after the detection of similarly
energetic eruptions in the northern hemisphere, at 22.2-23.0N. Our
observations, probing below the ammonia cloud deck, show that the erupting
plumes in the SEB bring up ammonia gas from the deep atmosphere. While models
of plume eruptions that are triggered at the water condensation level explain
data taken at uv-visible and mid-infrared wavelengths, our ALMA observations
provide a crucial, hitherto missing, link in the moist convection theory by
showing that ammonia gas from the deep atmosphere is indeed brought up in these
plumes. Contemporaneous HST data show that the plumes reach altitudes as high
as the tropopause. We suggest that the plumes at 22.2-23.0N also rise up well
above the ammonia cloud deck, and that descending air may dry the neighboring
belts even more than in quiescent times, which would explain our observations
in the north.

Title:Thermal instability through the outer half of quasi-static spherically symmetric molecular clumps and cores,"
Abstract:  Thermal instability (TI) is a trigger mechanism, which can explain formation
of condensations through some regions of the interstellar clouds. Our goal here
is to investigate some conditions for occurrence of TI and formation of
pre-condensations through the outer half a quasi-static spherical molecular
clump or core. The inner half is nearly singular and ambiguous so out of scope
of this research. We consider a spherically symmetric molecular cloud in
quasi-static and thermally equilibrium state, and we use the linear
perturbation method to investigate occurrence of TI through its outer half. The
origin of perturbations are assumed to be as Inside-Rush-Perturbation (IRP)
with outward perturbed velocity at inner region of the cloud, and
Outside-Rush-Perturbation (ORP) with inward perturbed velocity originated at
the outer parts of the cloud. The local thermal balance at the outer half of
the molecular cloud leads to a local loosely constrained power-law relation
between the pressure and density as $p \propto \rho^{1+\chi}$, where
$-0.4\lesssim \chi\lesssim 0.05$ depends on the functional form of the net
cooling function. Physically, the value of $\chi$ depends on the power of
dependence of magnetic field to the density, $\eta$, and also on the value of
magnetic field gradient, $\zeta$. For strong magnetic field (smaller $\eta$)
and/or large field gradient (greater $\zeta$), the value of $\chi$ decreases,
and vice versa. The results show that increasing of the value of $\chi$ leads
to form a flatter density profiles at the thermally equilibrium outer half of
the molecular clump or core, and to occur more thermally unstable IRP and ORP
with smaller growth time-scales, and vice versa.

"Title:Narrow, Intrinsic CIV Absorption in Quasars as it Relates to Outflows, Orientation, and Radio Properties","
Abstract:  This work provides evidence that a large fraction of \ion{C}{IV} narrow
absorption lines (NALs) seen along the line of sight to distant quasars are due
to accretion disk winds, while also seeking to understand the relationship
between NALs and certain quasar-intrinsic properties. We extend the results
from past work in the literature using $\sim105,000$ NALs from a sample of
$\sim58,000$ SDSS quasars. The primary results of this work are summarized as
follows: (1) the velocity distribution (${\rm d}N/{\rm d}\beta$) of NALs is not
a function of radio loudness (or even detection) once marginalized by
optical/UV luminosity; (2) there are significant differences in the number and
distribution of NALs as a function of both radio spectral index and optical/UV
luminosity, and these two findings are not entirely interdependent; (3)
improvements in quasar systemic redshift measurements and differences in the
NAL distribution as a combined function of optical luminosity and radio
spectral index together provide evidence that a significant portion of NALs are
due to outflows; (4) the results are consistent with standard models of
accretion disk winds governed by the $L_{\rm UV}$-$\alpha_{ox}$ relationship
and line-of-sight orientation indicated by radio spectral index, and (5)
possibly support a magnetically arrested disk model as an explanation for the
semi-stochastic nature of strong radio emission in a fraction of quasars.

Title:Tidal radii of main sequence stars -- II. Simulation methodology and the character of full tidal disruptions,"
Abstract:  This is the second in a series of papers presenting the results of fully
general relativistic simulations of stellar tidal disruptions in which the
stars' initial states are realistic main-sequence models. We consider eight
different stellar masses, from $0.15~{\rm M}_\odot$ to $10~{\rm M}_\odot$. In
the first paper (Ryu et al. 2019a), we gave an overview of this program and
discussed the principal observational implications of our work. Here we
describe our calculational method and provide details about the outcomes of
full disruptions. We find that, relative to the traditional order-of-magnitude
estimate $r_{\rm t}$, the physical tidal radius of low-mass stars is larger by
tens of percent, while for high-mass stars ($M_{\star} \gtrsim1~ {\rm
M}_\odot$) it is smaller by a factor $2-2.5$. The traditional estimate of the
range of energies found in the debris is approximately accurate for low-mass
stars, but is a factor $\sim 2$ too small for high-mass stars; in addition, the
energy distribution for high-mass stars has significant wings. For all stars
undergoing tidal encounters, we find that mass-loss continues for a long time
because the ${\it instantaneous}$ tidal radius, the distance out to which the
black hole's tidal gravity competes with the instantaneous stellar gravity at
the star's surface, stays comparable to the distance to the black hole until
the star has reached $O(10)~r_{\rm t}$. These findings indicate significant
failings in the popular ""frozen-in"" approximation.

Title:Bright Southern Variable Stars in the bRing Survey,"
Abstract:  Besides monitoring the bright star $\beta$ Pic during the near transit event
for its giant exoplanet, the $\beta$ Pictoris b Ring (bRing) observatories at
Siding Springs Observatory, Australia and Sutherland, South Africa have
monitored the brightnesses of bright stars ($V$ $\simeq$ 4--8 mag) centered on
the south celestial pole ($\delta$ $\leq$ -30$^{\circ}$) for approximately two
years. Here we present a comprehensive study of the bRing time series
photometry for bright southern stars monitored between 2017 June and 2019
January. Of the 16762 stars monitored by bRing, 353 of them were found to be
variable. Of the variable stars, 80% had previously known variability and 20%
were new variables. Each of the new variables was classified, including 3 new
eclipsing binaries (HD 77669, HD 142049, HD 155781), 26 $\delta$ Scutis, 4
slowly pulsating B stars, and others. This survey also reclassified four stars
based on their period of pulsation, light curve, spectral classification, and
color-magnitude information. The survey data were searched for new examples of
transiting circumsecondary disk systems, but no candidates were found.

Title:A Survey of Magnetic Field Strengths in the Envelopes of Molecular Clouds via the 18 cm OH Zeeman Effect,"
Abstract:  We present the results of an extensive Arecibo observational survey of
magnetic field strengths in the inter-core regions of molecular clouds to
determine their role in the evolution and collapse of molecular clouds as a
whole. Sensitive 18 cm OH Zeeman observations of absorption lines from Galactic
molecular gas in the direction of extragalactic continuum sources yielded 38
independent measurements of magnetic field strengths. Zeeman detections were
achieved at the three sigma level toward 9 clouds, while the others revealed
sensitive upper limits to the magnetic field strength. Our results suggest that
total field strengths in the inter-core regions of GMCs are about 15
microgauss.
