Title:Gamma-Ray Bursts as the Death Throes of Massive Binary Stars,"
Abstract:  It is proposed that gamma-ray bursts are created in the mergers of double
neutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binaries at cosmological
distances. Bursts with complex profiles and relatively long durations are the
result of magnetic flares generated by the Parker instability in a post-merger
differentially-rotating disk. Some bursts may also be produced through
neutrino-antineutrino annihilation into electrons and positrons. In both cases,
an optically thick fireball of size $\sles\ 100$ km is initially created, which
expands ultrarelativistically to large radii before radiating. Several previous
objections to the cosmological merger model are eliminated. It is predicted
that $\gamma$-ray bursts will be accompanied by a burst of gravitational
radiation from the spiraling-in binary which could be detected by LIGO.

Title:Gravitational Lensing and the Variability of G,"
Abstract:  The four observables associated with gravitational lensing of distant quasars
by intervening galaxies: image splittings, relative amplifications, time
delays, and optical depths, provide separate measures of the strength of the
gravitational constant $G$ at cosmological distances. These allow one, in
principle, to factor out unknown lensing parameters to directly to probe the
variation of $G$ over cosmological time. We estimate constraints on $\dot{G}$
which may be derivable by this method both now and in the future. The limits
one may obtain can compete or exceed other direct limits on $\dot{G}$ today,
but unfortunately extracting this information, is not independent of the effort
to fix other cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\Omega_0$ from lensing
observations.

Title:The Ptolemaic Gamma-Ray Burst Universe,"
Abstract:  The BATSE experiment on GRO has demonstrated the isotropic arrival directions
and flat $\log N$ {\it vs.} $\log S$ of cosmic gamma-ray bursts. These data are
best explained if the burst sources are distributed throughout an extended
spherical Galactic halo, as previously suggested by Jennings. The halo's radius
is at least 40 Kpc, and probably is more than 100 Kpc. I consider possible
origins of this halo, including primordial formation and neutron stars
recoiling from their birthplaces in the Galactic disc. A simple geometrical
model leads to a predicted relation between the dipole and quadrupole
anisotropy. I suggest that neutron stars born with low recoil become
millisecond pulsars, while those born with high recoil become the sources of
gamma-ray bursts; these populations are nearly disjoint. Quiescent counterparts
of gamma-ray bursts are predicted to be undetectably faint.

Title:Expanding Photospheres of Type II Supernovae and the Extragalactic Distance Scale,"
Abstract:  We use the Expanding Photosphere Method to determine distances to 10 type II
supernovae. The effects of asymmetries, extinction, and flux dilution are
explored. Using empirical evidence and time-independent, spherical models which
treat H and He in non-LTE, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux
dilution are small for type II supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical
when their color temperatures are less than 6000~K. The extinction to a type
II-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty
introduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than
10\%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution we derive distances to 10
supernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN
1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide
range, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc, which is unique among the methods for establishing
the extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M101
and SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from
Cepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +- 3 Mpc, is
larger than recent distances estimates made using surface brightness
fluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher
method. Using the distances determined from these type II supernovae we derive
a value of $H_0 = 60 \pm 10$ km sec$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is subject to
errors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow, but will soon be improved
by applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant type II
supernovae.

Title:Radiation Transfer in Gamma-Ray Bursts,"
Abstract:  We have calculated gamma-ray radiative transport in regions of high energy
density, such as gamma-ray burst source regions, using a discrete ordinate,
discrete energy group method. The calculations include two-photon pair
production and annihilation, as well as three-photon pair annihilation. The
radiation field itself acts as an absorbing medium, and the optical depth
depends on its intensity, so the problem is intrinsically nonlinear. Spherical
divergence produces effective collimation of the flux. At high optical depth
the high energy ($E > 1$ MeV) portion of the emergent spectrum assumes a nearly
universal form. An approximate limit is derived for the high energy flux from a
gamma-ray burst source region of given size, and the implications of this limit
for the distance to the March 5, 1979 event are briefly discussed. We discuss
more generally the problem of very luminous bursts, and implications of
Galactic halo distances for flare models.

Title:Primordial Nucleosynthesis and the Abundances of Beryllium and Boron,"
Abstract:  The ability to now make measurements of Be and B as well as put constraints
on \lisix\ abundances in metal-poor stars has led to a detailed reexamination
of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in the $A\groughly6$ regime. The nuclear reaction
network has been significantly expanded with many new rates added. It is
demonstrated that although a number of $A>7$ reaction rates are poorly
determined, even with extreme values chosen, the standard homogeneous model is
unable to produce significant yields (Be/H and B/H $<10^{-17}$ when $A\le7$
abundances fit) above $A=7$ and the \liseven/\lisix\ ratio always exceeds 500.
We also preliminarily explore inhomogeneous models, such as those inspired by a
first order quark-hadron phase transition, where regions with high
neutron/proton ratios can allow some leakage up to $A>7$. However models that
fit the $A\le7$ abundances still seem to have difficulty in obtaining
significant $A>7$ yields.

Abstract:  We calculate the flux of ultra high energy photons from individual ordinary

sensitivity of current and proposed TeV and EeV telescopes. Our calculations
give only upper limits for the gamma ray flux, since the source of the photons,
jets from particle production at cusps, may be weakened by back reaction
effects. For the usual cosmic distribution of strings, the predicted bursts
from strings with the value of mass per unit length associated with galaxy
formation or light strings may just be detectable. A diffuse gamma ray
background from light strings may also be seen by the Fly's Eye detector at
above $7 \times 10^{10}$ GeV.

Title:Baryogenesis from Unstable Domain Walls,"
Abstract:  There exists a class of cosmic strings that turn matter into antimatter
(Alice strings). In a GUT where the unbroken gauge group contains charge
conjugation ($C$), such strings form when a phase transition renders $C$ a
discrete symmetry. They become boundaries of domain walls at a later,
$C$-breaking transition. These `Alice walls' are cosmologically harmless, but
can play an important role in baryogenesis. We present a three-generation toy
model with scalar baryons, where a quasi-static Alice wall (or a gas of such
walls) temporarily gives rise to net baryogenesis of uniform sign everywhere in
space. This becomes a permanent baryon excess if the wall shrinks away early
enough.
We comment on the possible relevance of a similar mechanism to baryogenesis
in a realistic $\soten$ unification model, where
Alice walls would form at the scale of left-right symmetry breaking.

Title:Evolution of Elliptical Galaxies: The Multiphase Model,"
Abstract:  We present a multiphase model for the evolution of elliptical galaxies.
Diffuse gas, molecular clouds, stars and remnants are taken into account.
Cloud--cloud collisions and stimulated processes are the main causes of star
formation. The occurrence of winds driven by Supernovae is considered, and the
evolution of the system is computed also after the first wind, allowing for
further star formation from the restored gas. The evolution of the abundances
of 15 elements or isotopes is followed with detailed stellar nucleosynthesis.
Stellar lifetimes are taken into account and a new IMF has been adopted. The
gas removal due to the Supernovae explosions depends on the galactic mass and
the presence of dark matter; the subsequent wind episodes are crucial to the
intergalactic gas enrichment. Good agreement is obtained for current SNs rates,
Star Formation Rate and gas masses when compared to the available data.

Title:Gravitational Radiation from Colliding Vacuum Bubbles: Envelope Approximation to Many-Bubble Collisions,"
Abstract:  We introduce an approximation to calculate the gravitational radiation
produced by the collision of true-vacuum bubbles that is simple enough to allow
the simulation of a phase transition by the collision of hundreds of bubbles.
This ``envelope approximation'' neglects the complicated ``overlap'' regions of
colliding bubbles and follows only the evolution of the bubble walls. The
approximation accurately reproduces previous results for the gravitational
radiation from the collision of two scalar-field vacuum bubbles. Using a bubble
nucleation rate given by $\Gamma = \Gamma_0 e^{\beta t}$, we simulate a phase
transition by colliding 20 to 200 bubbles; the fraction of vacuum energy
released into gravity waves is $E_{\rm GW}/E_{\rm vac} = 0.06(H/\beta)^2$ and
the peak of the spectrum occurs at $\omega_{\rm max}=1.6\beta$ ($H^2=8\pi G\rho
/3$ is the Hubble constant associated with the false-vacuum phase). The
spectrum is very similar to that in the two-bubble case, except that the
efficiency of gravity-wave generation is about five times higher, presumably
due to the fact that a given bubble collides with many others. Finally, we
consider two further ``statistical'' approximations, where the gravitational
radiation is computed as an incoherent sum over individual bubbles weighted by
the distribution of bubble sizes. These approximations provide reasonable
estimates of the gravitational-wave spectrum with far less computation.

Title:A Possible Solution to the Horizon Problem: The Mad Era for Massless Scalar Theories of Gravity,"
Abstract:  Extensions of Einstein gravity which allow the gravitational constant $G$ to
change with time as the universe evolves may provide a resolution to the
horizon problem without invoking a period of vacuum domination and without the
subsequent entropy violation. In a cosmology for which the gravitational
constant is not in fact constant, the universe may be older at a given
temperature than in a standard Hot Big Bang universe; thus, larger regions of
space could have come into causal contact at that temperature. This opens the
possibility that large regions became smooth at some high temperature without
violating causality. The extra aging of the universe can be accomplished by an
early period with a large Planck mass, a period we call the MAD era (Modified
Aging era or the Massively Aged and Detained era). We discuss in this paper
theories of gravity in which the gravitational constant is replaced with a
function of a scalar field. However, this resolution to the smoothness problem

for the universe that is the fifth force which has been proposed in the
literature. It explains the universal expansion itself and shows why the
expansion must be slowing down at present. This force depends on the ratio of
the number of neutrons to the number of protons. Its potential for the Universe
is a well. At the bottom of the well the potential is of the form $kx^2$, where
$x$ is the separation among the bodies under consideration. It is suggested
that Nature has six fundamental forces which are unified in pairs and,
therefore, reduced to three at $t=0$. The condition for having a closed
universe is found. This new force, called superweak force in this paper,
explains also the evolution of galaxies and shows how the arms of spiral
galaxies(including barred spirals) are formed. The variation of the Hubble
constant with time is shown. It is shown that quarks are formed of prequarks
which may be the true elementary particles. The paper also gives a physical
explanation for quark confinement. The energies of baryon states are calculated

Title:Vacuum Decay in Theories with Symmetry Breaking by Radiative Corrections,"
Abstract:  The standard bounce formalism for calculating the decay rate of a metastable
vacuum cannot be applied to theories in which the symmetry breaking is due to
radiative corrections, because in such theories the tree-level action has no
bounce solutions. In this paper I derive a modified formalism to deal with such
cases. As in the usual case, the bubble nucleation rate may be written in the
form $A e^{-B}$. To leading approximation, $B$ is the bounce action obtained by
replacing the tree-level potential by the leading one-loop approximation to the
effective potential, in agreement with the generally adopted {\it ad hoc}
remedy. The next correction to $B$ (which is proportional to an inverse power
of a small coupling) is given in terms of the next-to-leading term in the
effective potential and the leading correction to the two-derivative term in
the effective action. The corrections beyond these (which may be included in
the prefactor) do not have simple expressions in terms of the effective
potential and the other functions in the effective action. In particular, the
scalar-loop terms which give an imaginary part to the effective potential do
not explicitly appear; the corresponding effects are included in a functional
determinant which gives a manifestly real result for the nucleation rate.

Title:Giant Molecular Cloud Formation through the Parker Instability in a Skewed Magnetic Field,"
Abstract:  The effect of the magnetic skew on the Parker instability is investigated by
means of the linear stability analysis for a gravitationally stratified gas
layer permeated by a horizontal magnetic field. When the magnetic field is
skewed (i.e., the field line direction is a function of the height), the
wavelength of the most unstable mode is $ \lambda \; \sim \; 10 H $ where $ H $
is the pressure scale height. The growth rate of the short wavelength modes is
greatly reduced when the gradient in the magnetic field direction exceeds 0.5
radian per scale height. Our results indicate that the Parker instability in a
skewed magnetic field preferentially forms large scale structures like giant
molecular clouds.

Abstract:  I present a model for acceleration of protons by the second-order Fermi

Title:The Spatial Distribution of Nearby Galaxy Clusters in the Northern and Southern Galactic Hemispheres,"
Abstract:  We compare the spatial distributions of galaxy clusters in the northern and
southern galactic hemispheres, and the Abell and ACO clusters distributions. We
perform a statistical (correlation and cluster) analysis of a sample of Abell
and ACO galaxy clusters in the southern galactic hemisphere. We compare these
results with a symmetric sample at northern galactic latitude taken from
Postman et al. (1992). For the northern sample, we substantially confirm the
results of Postman et al. We find that the two-point spatial correlation
function of northern and southern clusters is comparable, with mean correlation
length 19.6 Mpc and slope -1.8 positive up to about 45 Mpc. Percolation
properties are remarkably similar in the northern and southern cluster samples.
We give also a catalog of superclusters. In the south galactic hemisphere the
main feature is a very rich, extended supercluster in the Horologium region at
a redshift 0.06, near to a large void.

Abstract:  The quark-hadron phase transition in the early universe can produce

been assumed that the degree of supercooling of the quark-gluon plasma after
the phase transition is large enough to produce a significant rate of
nucleation of hadrons. Using the latest results of finite temperature lattice

Abstract:  Global textures are interesting because they are promising candidates for
seeds in the structure formation of the universe. The important configurations
are those who will be able to collapse. The type of configurations that I will
consider are half knots and true knots. I define a half knot as one that covers
more than a half-$S^3$, and a true knot as a configuration that covers the
whole of $S^3$. Configurations that are half knots will be able to collapse, a
new argument for this collapse criterion is given in this paper. I also give
some critical remarks on the method of using the total winding number as a
criterion for identifying a knot. I propose another more direct method and make
use of it when I estimate the probability for formation of both true and half
knots by numerical simulations.Taking into account the chance of annihilation
the probability for collapse is found to be in the interval $p_{coll} \in
[0.01,0.04]$. In the skyrmion picture of hadrons the investigations of
formation of true knots are important, and some implications of my result on
the predictions of a ""topological"" theory of baryon production in jets are

Title:Binary Black Holes in Stationary Orbits,"
Abstract:  We show that under certain astrophysical conditions a binary system
consisting of two compact objects can be stabilized against indefinite
shrinking of orbits due to the emission of gravitational radiation. In this
case, the lighter binary companion settles down to a stable orbit when the loss
of the angular momentum due to gravitational radiation becomes equal to its
gain from the accreting matter from the disk around the more massive primary.
We claim that such systems can be stable against small perturbations and can be
regarded as steady emitters of gravitational waves of constant frequency and
amplitude. Furthermore, X-rays emitted by the secondary can also produce
astrophysically interesting situations when coupled with gravitational lensing
and Doppler effects.

Abstract:  We analyse the implications for inflationary models of the cosmic microwave
background (cmb) anisotropy measured by COBE. Vacuum fluctuations during
inflation generate an adiabatic density perturbation, and also gravitational
waves. The ratio of these two contributions to the cmb anisotropy is given for
an arbitrary slow-roll inflaton potential. Results from the IRAS/QDOT and
POTENT galaxy surveys are used to normalise the spectrum of the density
perturbation on the scale $20h^{-1}\Mpc$, so that the COBE measurement on the
scale $10^3h^{-1}\Mpc$ provides a lower bound on the spectral index $n$. For
`power law' and `extended' inflation, gravitational waves are significant and
the bound is $n>0.84$ at the $2$-sigma level. For `natural' inflation,
gravitational waves are negligible and the constraint is weakened to $n>0.70$,
at best marginally consistent with a recent proposal for explaining the excess
clustering observed in the APM galaxy survey. Many versions of extended
inflation, including those based on the Brans--Dicke theory, are ruled out,
because they require $n\lsim 0.75$ in order that bubbles formed at the end of
inflation should not be observed now in the cmb.

Abstract:  We derive a formula for the nonequilibrium entropy of a classical stochastic

applied to define the entropy of gravitational perturbations (both

specific cosmological model (the inflationary Universe) and find that on scales
of interest in cosmology the entropy in both density perturbations and
gravitational waves exceeds the entropy of statistical fluctuations of the
microwave background. The nonequilibrium entropy discussed here is a measure of
loss of information about the system. We discuss the origin of the entropy in
our cosmological models and compare the definition of entropy in terms of
correlation functions with the microcanonical definition in quantum statistical

the spectrum of perturbations deviates significantly from scale invariance

inflation). If the tensor mode dominates at large-angular scales, then the
value of $\Delta T/T$ predicted on $1^\circ$ is less than if the scalar mode
dominates, and, for cold dark matter models, $b>1$ can be made consistent with

Abstract:  Constraints on the core temperature (T_c) of the Sun and on neutrino-
oscillation parameters are obtained from the existing solar neutrino data,
including the recent GALLEX and Kamiokande III results. (1) A purely
astrophysical solution to the solar neutrino problem is strongly disfavored by
the data: the best fit in a cooler Sun model requires an 8% reduction in T_c,
but the chi-sqaured test rejects this hypothesis at 99.99% C.L., suggesting new
neutrino physics. (2) Assuming the Standard Solar Model (SSM) and MSW
oscillations, the MSW parameters are constrained to two small regions: one in
the non-adiabatic region and the other in the large-mixing region. The
non-adiabatic solution gives a considerably better fit. For nu_e oscillations
into sterile neutrinos, the allowed region (90%) is constrained to non-
adiabatic oscillations. As long as the SSM is assumed, the neutrino mixing
angles are at least four times larger, or considerably smaller, than the
corresponding quark mixing angles. (3) Allowing both MSW oscillations and a
non-standard core temperature, a) the experiments determine the core
temperature at the 5% level, yielding a value consistent with the SSM
prediction. b) When T_c is used as a free parameter, the allowed MSW region is
broadened: a cooler Sun (T_c=0.95) allows mass and mixing implied by the SUSY
SO(10) GUT, while a warmer Sun (T_c=1.05) allows parameter space suggested by
intermediate-scale SO(10) GUTs. Superstring-inspired models are consistent with
all solutions. (4) From the narrowed parameter space, we predict the neutrino
spectral shape which should be observed in SNO. Throughout the calculation we
use the latest Bahcall-Pinsonneault SSM, and include nuclear and astrophysical
uncertainties in a simplified, but physically transparent way.

Title:COBE's Constraints on the Global Monopole and Texture Theories of Cosmic Structure Formation,"
Abstract:  We report on a calculation of large scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave
background radiation in the global monopole and texture models for cosmic
structure formation. We have evolved the six component linear gravitational
field along with the monopole or texture scalar fields numerically in an
expanding universe and performed the Sachs-Wolfe integrals directly on the
calculated gravitational fields. On scales $> 7^\circ$, we find a Gaussian
distribution with an approximately scale invariant fluctuation spectrum. The
$\Delta T/T$ amplitude is a factor of 4-5 larger than the prediction of the
standard CDM model with the same Hubble constant and density fluctuation
normalization. The recently reported COBE-DMR results imply that global
monopole and texture models require high bias factors or a large Hubble
constant in contrast to standard CDM which requires very low $H_0$ and bias
values. For $H_0 = 70 {\rm {km\over sec} Mpc^{-1}}$, we find that normalizing
to the COBE results implies $b_8 \simeq 3.2\pm 1.4$ (95\% c.l.). If we restrict
ourselves to the range of bias factors thought to be reasonable before the
announcement of the COBE results, $1.5 \lsim b_8 \lsim 2.5$, then it is fair to
conclude that global monopoles and textures are consistent with the COBE
results and are a {\it better} fit than Standard CDM.

hydrodynamic simulations of the starburst event to much later times and larger
scales than previously considered. For our models, we adopt a supernova rate of
0.1 ${\rm yr}^{-1}$, and an extended low-density static halo that is bound to
the galaxy. There are three stages to the evolution of the wind-blown bubble
and the propagation of the shock front: the bubble expands in an almost uniform
density disk gas, with a deceleration of the shock front ($t \alt $ 3.6 Myr);
breakout from the disk and the upward acceleration of the shock front (3.6
Myr $\alt t \alt$ 18 Myr); propagation into the halo, leading to a more
spherical system and shock deceleration (18 Myr $\alt t$). For a halo density
of $10^{-3} {\rm cm}^{-3}$, the outflow reaches a distance of 40-50 kpc from
the center of the starburst galaxy in 50 Myr. We calculate the time evolution
of the X-ray luminosity and find that the extended starburst emits $3\times
10^{39}\lcgs$ to $10^{40}\lcgs$ in the
GINGA LAC band and $\sim 10^{41}\lcgs$ in the Einstein or ROSAT

Harrison--Zel'dovich spectrum, may provide an explanation for the excess large
scale clustering seen in galaxy surveys such as the APM survey. In the light of
the new results from COBE, we examine in detail here cold dark matter
cosmogonies based on inflationary models predicting power-law spectra. Along
with power-law and extended inflation, this class includes natural inflation.
The latter is of interest because, unlike the first two, it produces a
power-law spectrum without significant gravitational wave production. We
examine a range of phenomena, including large angle microwave background
fluctuations, clustering in the galaxy distribution, bulk peculiar velocity
flows, the formation of high redshift quasars and the epoch of structure
formation. Of the three models, only natural inflation seems capable of
explaining the large scale clustering of optical galaxies. Such a model, though
at best marginal even at present, has some advantages over standard CDM and on
most grounds appears to perform at least as well. Power-law inflation's primary
interest may ultimately only be in permitting a larger bias parameter than
standard CDM; it appears unable to explain excess clustering. Most models of
extended inflation are ruled out at a high confidence level.

redshift quasars PKS 0637--75 (z=0.654) and MC 1104+16 (z=0.632) have been
carried out, obtaining relatively high S/N, spectrophotometrically calibrated
data on their energy distribution from the rest frame H$_{\beta}$ to the Lyman
continuum. Six more quasars in the redshift range 2.5-3.4 have been observed in
the optical domain. For all the quasars the ``intrinsic'' continuum slope and
normalization have been estimated longward the Ly$_{\alpha}$ emission and
extrapolated towards the Lyman continuum to measure the average depressions,
which have been compared with the model statistics of the Ly$_{\alpha}$ clouds.
When all the known classes of absorbers are taken into account with plausible
values for their equivalent width distribution and evolution, a good agreement
is obtained with the observations. The results for the observed continuum
decrement at $z \sim 0.65$ are identical to those predicted by the evolution
with redshift of the number of Ly$_{\alpha}$ forest systems including the HST
data and within $2\sigma$ of the predicted value using the ``standard''
Ly$_{\alpha}$ evolution (as determined only at high z).

"Title:Cosmic Rays, Gamma Rays and Neutrinos from Point Sources","
Abstract:  The suggestion has been made that the energy spectrum from point sources such
as AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) and GBHC (Galactic Black Hole Candidates) is
universal, irrespective of the nature of the emitted particles. A comparison of
the energy spectrum for cosmic rays at the source and $\gamma$-rays from
quasars obtained recently by CGRO (Compton Gamma Ray Observatory) indicates
that the prediction is in agreement with the data in the average sense. This
suggests that neutrinos from point sources should have a spectral index
identical to that of $\gamma$-rays for an individual point source. This
prediction is also consistent with the recent observation of neutrinos by
Kamiokande and IMB in which the ratio of $\nu_\mu/\nu_e$ is close to 1, instead
of 2 as expected from atmospheric neutrinos. For a further test of the model,
analysis of the time variation of $\gamma$-ray spectra from quasars is
suggested.

Title:Dynamics of the Young Binary LMC Cluster NGC 1850,"
Abstract:  In this paper we have examined the age and internal dynamics of the young
binary LMC cluster NGC 1850 using BV CCD images and echelle spectra of 52
supergiants. Isochrone fits to a BV color-magnitude diagram revealed that the
primary cluster has an age of $\tau = 90 \pm 30$ Myr while the secondary member
has $\tau = 6 \pm 5$ Myr. BV surface brightness profiles were constructed out
to R $>$ 40 pc, and single-component King-Michie (KM) models were applied. The
total cluster luminosity varied from L$_B$ = 2.60 - 2.65 $\times 10^6$
L$_B$\sol\ and L$_V$ = 1.25 - 1.35 $\times 10^6$ as the anisotropy radius
varied from infinity to three times the scale radius with the isotropic models
providing the best agreement with the data. Of the 52 stars with echelle
spectra, a subset of 36 were used to study the cluster dynamics. The KM radial
velocity distributions were fitted to these velocities yielding total cluster
masses of 5.4 - 5.9 $\pm 2.4 \times 10^4$ M\sol\ corresponding to M/L$_B$ =
0.02 $\pm 0.01$ M\sol/L$_B$\sol\ or M/L$_V$ = 0.05 $\pm 0.02$ M\sol/L$_V$\sol.
A rotational signal in the radial velocities has been detected at the 93\%
confidence level implying a rotation axis at a position angle of 100. A
variety of rotating models were fit to the velocity data assuming cluster
ellipticities of $\epsilon = 0.1 - 0.3$. These models provided slightly better
agreement with the radial velocity data than the KM models and had masses that
were systematically lower by a few percent. The preferred value for the slope
of a power-law IMF is a relatively shallow, $x = 0.29 \pmm{+0.3}{-0.8}$
assuming the B-band M/L or $x = 0.71 \pmm{+0.2}{-0.4}$ for the V-band.

Title:On the Origin of the Galactic Magnetic Field,"
Abstract:  The galactic magnetic field is commonly supposed to be due to a dynamo acting
on some large scale seed field. A major difficulty with this idea is that
estimates of reasonable seed field strengths tend to be quite low, on the order
of $\sim10^{-20}$ gauss. Here we examine the contribution due to the flux
entrained in winds from protostars formed in the first dynamo e-folding time of
a galaxy's existence. Using a minimal estimate of a protostellar magnetic field
we find that if each protostar ejects a single current ring, sufficient to
maintain flux freezing in the wind, than the large scale average dipole field
from all such current rings will be at least 5 orders of magnitude larger than
previous seed field estimates. Allowing for a reasonable amount of magnetic
activity in protostars during an extended period of mass loss increases this to
a dipole seed field of $\sim10^{-12}$ gauss. For the purposes of producing a
seed field it is irrelevant whether or not this initial injection of flux takes
place in a newly formed galactic disk, or in star forming proto-galactic
clouds. The compression of this dipole field into a thin disk will lead to a
large scale $B_r\sim 10^{-10.5}$ gauss. Initially, field strengths on smaller
scales will be larger, but nowhere near current levels.

Title:Effect of Neutrino Heating on Primordial Nucleosynthesis,"
Abstract:  We have modified the standard code for primordial nucleosynthesis to include
the effect of the slight heating of neutrinos by $e^\pm$ annihilations. There
is a small, systematic change in the $^4$He yield, $\Delta Y \simeq +1.5\times
10^{-4}$, which is insensitive to the value of the baryon-to-photon ratio
$\eta$ for $10^{-10}\la \eta \la 10^{-9}$. We also find that the
baryon-to-photon ratio decreases by about 0.5\% less than the canonical factor
of 4/11 because some of the entropy in $e^\pm$ pairs is transferred to
neutrinos. These results are in accord with recent analytical estimates.

averaging out small scale wiggles on the string is obtained in the general case

Title:A rotating black hole in the Galactic Center,"
Abstract:  Recent observations of Sgr A* give strong constraints for possible models of
the physical nature of Sgr A* and suggest the presence of a massive black~hole
with M<2 10^6 M_sun surrounded by an accretion disk which we estimate to
radiate at a luminosity of <7 10^5 L_sun. We therefore calculate the appearance
of a standard accretion disk around a Kerr hole in Sgr A* following from
general relativity and a few fundamental assumptions. Effective temperature and
luminosity of the disk spectra do not depend on the unknown viscosity mechanism
but instead are quite sensitive to variations of intrinsic parameters: the
mass, the accretion rate, the angular momentum of the accreting hole and the
inclination angle. A radiation field of L~7 10^4 - 7 10^5 L_sun and T_eff ~ 2-4
10^4 K can be ascribed to a rapidly rotating Kerr~hole (a>0.9) accreting
10^-8.5 - 10^-7 M_sun/yr at a black~hole mass of M=2 10^6 M_sunseen almost edge
on. A low mass black hole of M<10^3 M_sun seems to be very unlikely. We provide
a ``Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for black holes'' together with simple scaling
laws to provide an easy-to-handle test for the black hole model.

Abstract:  We study the formation of structure for a universe that undergoes a recent

matter are found to be robust to changes in the expansion law, an exception
being that the peculiar velocities are lower by a factor of $\sim 3$ in the
loitering model. Further, in the loitering scenario, nonlinear growth of
perturbation occurs more recently ($z\sim 3-5$) than in the matter dominated
case. Differences in the high redshift appearances of the two models will
result but observable consequences depend critically on the chosen form, onset

Title:Gravity's rainbow,"
Abstract:  Could COBE DMR be detecting the imprint from a spectrum of gravitational
waves generated during inflation? The conventional inflationary prediction had
been that the cosmic microwave anisotropy is dominated by energy density
fluctuations generated during inflation and that the gravitational waves
contribute negligibly. In this paper, we report on recent work (in
collaboration with R. Davis, H. Hodges, and M. Turner) that has shown that the
conventional wisdom may be wrong; specifically, gravitational waves may
dominate the anisotropy in inflationary models where the spectrum of
perturbations deviates significantly from scale invariance (e.g., extended and
power-law inflation models and extreme versions of chaotic inflation). If
gravitational waves do dominate at the large-angular scales measured by COBE
DMR, the expectation and interpretation of anisotropies on small-angular scales

Abstract:  Using the squeezed state formalism the coherent state representation of
quantum fluctuations in an expanding universe is derived. It is shown that this
provides a useful alternative to the Wigner function as a phase space
representation of quantum fluctuations. The quantum to classical transition of
fluctuations is naturally implemented by decohering the density matrix in this
representation. The entropy of the decohered vacua is derived. It is shown that
the decoherence process breaks the physical equivalence between vacua that
differ by a coordinate dependent phase generated by a surface term in the
Lagrangian. In particular, scale invariant power spectra are only obtained for
a special choice of surface term.

Abstract:  We use the analytical model recently introduced in Ref. \cite{lp92}, to
investigate the statistics of temperature fluctuations on the cosmic microwave
background (CMB), induced by topological defects. The cases of cosmic strings
and textures are studied. We derive analytically the characteristic function of
the probability distribution for ${\delta T}\over T$ and use it to obtain the
lowest twelve moments including the skewness and the kurtosis. The distribution
function is also obtained and it is compared with the Gaussian distribution
thus identifying long non-Gaussian tails. We show that for both cosmic strings
and textures all odd moments (including skewness) vanish while the relative
deviation from the Gaussian for even moments increases with the order of the
moment. The non-Gaussian signatures of textures, derived from the distribution
function and the moments, are found to be much more prominent than the
corresponding signatures for strings. We discuss the physical origin of this
result.

Title:The Star Formation History in a Hierarchical Universe,"
Abstract:  Observations now probe the star formation history of the Universe back to a
redshift of $z\sim5$. We investigate whether the predictions of semi-analytic
models of galaxy formation based on hierarchical Cold Dark Matter (CDM) type
models are in agreement with these direct observations and also with the
``fossil'' evidence contained in constraints on the ages of present day
early-type galaxies. Previous models predicted that the star formation rate
density falls off rather steeply at $z\ga 2$, and correspondingly that the
majority of the stars in the Universe formed at relatively low redshift. We
investigate the effect of including a bursting mode of star formation, assuming
that galaxy-galaxy mergers trigger starbursts and using the merger rate that
arises naturally in the CDM merging hierarchy. The resulting starbursts
substantially increase the global star formation rate at high redshift, leading
to predictions that are in good agreement with the star formation rate density
at $z\sim3$ obtained from sub-millimeter observations (SCUBA) and optical/UV
estimates after correction for dust extinction. The mass of stars formed at $z
\ge 3$ is correspondingly in better agreement with the fossil evidence. We also
investigate complementary global quantities such as the mass of cold gas and
the average metallicity of cold gas as a function of redshift, and the
integrated extra-galactic background light. We argue that these observations,
taken together, provide strong constraints on the star formation history of the
Universe, and that hierarchical models of the CDM type are in reasonable
agreement with these observations when starbursts are included.

and density) between the conventional broad and narrow line regions (BLR and
NLR, respectively). From our observations and modelling of the spectra, we get
a consistent decomposition of the line profiles into four components: an
extended H II region with unresolved lines, two distinct Seyfert-type clouds
identified with the NLR, and a relatively narrow ""broad line"" component
emitting only Balmer lines but no forbidden lines. Therefore, and although we
find this object to be exceptional in having line-emission from the BLR with
almost the same width as the narrow lines, our interpretation of the data does
not support the existence of an ""intermediate"" line region (ILR).

Abstract:  We present numerical testing results of our mass function derived in our

test: the scale-free power-law spectra P(k) \propto k^{n} with spectral indices
n=-1, 0 and the standard cold dark matter (SCDM) model with Omega =1 and h=0.5.
For the power-law models, we use numerical data averaged over several different
output times: ten output times from two N-body realizations for the n=-1
power-law model; four outputs from one realization for the n=0 model. While for
the SCDM model, we consider four outputs separately at redshifts z = 0, 0.43,
1.14 and 1.86 from one large N-body simulations. The comparison results show
that our mass function fits the numerical data in a much improved way over the

Abstract:  We have examined the ROSAT PSPC X-ray properties of a sample of 15 Abell
clusters containing 23 narrow-angle tailed (NAT) radio galaxies. We find that
clusters with NATs show a significantly higher level of substructure than a
similar sample of radio-quiet clusters, indicating that NAT radio sources are
preferentially located in dynamically complex systems. Also, the velocity
distribution of the NAT galaxies is similar to that of other cluster members;
these velocities are inadequate for producing the ram pressure necessary to
bend the radio jets. We therefore propose a new model for NAT formation, in
which NATs are associated with dynamically complex clusters undergoing merger
events. The U-shaped NAT morphology is produced in part by the merger-induced
bulk motion of the ICM bending the jets.

Title:On Measuring Chemical Abundances in Distant Galaxies Using Global Emission Line Spectra,"
Abstract:  The advent of 8--10 meter class telescopes enables direct measurement of the
chemical properties in the ionized gas of cosmologically--distant galaxies with
the same nebular analysis techniques used in local H II regions. We show that
spatially unresolved (i.e., global) emission line spectra can reliably indicate
the chemical properties of distant star-forming galaxies. However, standard
nebular chemical abundance measurement methods (those with a measured electron
temperature from [O III] lambda4363) may be subject to small systematic errors
when the observed volume includes a mixture of gas with diverse temperatures,
ionization parameters, and metallicities. To characterize these systematic
effects, we compare physical conditions derived from spectroscopy of individual
H II regions with results from global galaxy spectroscopy. We consider both
low-mass, metal poor galaxies with uniform abundances and larger galaxies with
internal chemical gradients. Well-established empirical calibrations using
strong-line ratios can serve as reliable (~0.2 dex) indicators of the overall
systemic oxygen abundance even when the signal-to-noise of the Hbeta and [O
III] emission lines is as low as 8:1. We present prescriptions, directed toward
high-redshift observers, for using global emission line spectra to trace the
chemical properties of star-forming galaxies in the distant universe.

Abstract:  A weakly magnetized ($\sim 10^7$G) neutron star, slowly spun up by accretion
in an X-ray binary, crosses the instability boundary for r-mode instability at
P=1--2 msec. The amplitude of the oscillation, which initially increases only
at the spinup time scale, is secularly unstable due to the negative temperature
dependence of the viscosity in neutron star matter, and diverges after a few
hundred years. Angular momentum loss by the gravitational wave causes strong
differential rotation, in which the magnetic field is wound up to $10^{17}$G on
a time scale of a few months. When this field becomes unstable to buoyancy
instability, a surface field strength of a few $10^{16}$G is produced on a time
scale of seconds, which then powers a GRB with energies of $\sim 1-8\times

Characterizing the interaction between these clouds and their surroundings
should be useful in understanding one source of interstellar turbulence:
vertical shear flows. This paper discusses how studies of the morphology and
drag coefficient of falling clouds might be used to constrain the Reynolds
number for the flow, and hence the effective viscosity of the warm ionized

Abstract:  Cosmic ray particles with energies in excess of 10**(20) eV have been

endowing cosmic ray particles with such enormous energies are unknown. This
report gives a review of the physics and astrophysics associated with the
questions of origin and propagation of these Extremely High Energy (EHE) cosmic
rays in the Universe. After a brief review of the observed cosmic rays in
general and their possible sources and acceleration mechanisms, a detailed
discussion is given of possible ""top-down"" (non-acceleration) scenarios of
origin of EHE cosmic rays through decay of sufficiently massive particles
originating from processes in the early Universe. The massive particles can
come from collapse and/or annihilation of cosmic topological defects (such as
monopoles, cosmic strings, etc.) associated with Grand Unified Theories or they
could be some long-lived metastable supermassive relic particles that were
created in the early Universe and are decaying in the current epoch. The
highest energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum can thus be used as a probe of
new fundamental physics beyond Standard Model. We discuss the role of existing
and proposed cosmic ray, gamma-ray and neutrino experiments in this context. We
also discuss how observations with next generation experiments of images and
spectra of EHE cosmic ray sources can be used to obtain new information on

dynamics. We study this question numerically, using a particle-mesh code based
on a multi-grid solver for the (nonlinear) MOND field equation. We start with
equilibrium distribution functions for MOND disk models having a smoothly
truncated, exponential surface-density profiles and a constant Toomre $Q$
parameter. We find that, indeed, disks of a given ``temperature'' are locally
more stable in MOND than in Newtonian dynamics. As regards global instability
to bar formation, we find that as the mean acceleration in the disk is lowered,
the stability of the disk is increased as we cross from the Newtonian to the
MOND regime. The degree of stability levels off deep in the MOND regime, as
expected from scaling laws in MOND. For the disk model we use, this maximum
degree of stability is similar to the one imparted to a Newtonian disk by a
halo three times as massive at five disk scale lengths.

1996, with 4.0 sigma significance for E>100 MeV, and 5.2 sigma significance for
E>500 MeV. The gamma-ray spectrum was measured to be flatter than most of the
gamma-ray blazars. We find that the multiband spectrum in 1996 is consistent
with that calculated from a one-zone SSC model in a homogeneous region. In the
context of this model, we investigate the values of the magnetic field strength
and the beaming factor allowed by the observational results. We compare the
March 1996 multiwavelength spectrum with that in the flare state in April 1997.
Between these two epochs, the TeV flux increase is well correlated with that
observed in keV range. The keV and TeV amplitudes during the April 1997 flare
are accurately reproduced, assuming that the population of synchrotron photons
in 1996 are scattered by the newly injected relativistic electrons, having
maximum energies of G_max = 6.0e6. However, the TeV spectrum observed during
March 1996 campaign is flatter than predicted by our models. We find that this
cannot be explained by either higher order Comptonization or the contribution
of the `seed' IR photons from the host galaxy for the first-order external
radiation Comptonization.

Title:A time varying speed of light as a solution to cosmological puzzles,"
Abstract:  We consider the cosmological implications of light travelling faster in the
early Universe. We propose a prescription for deriving corrections to the
cosmological evolution equations while the speed of light $c$ is changing. We
then show how the horizon, flatness, and cosmological constant problems may be
solved. We also study cosmological perturbations in this scenario and show how
one may solve the homogeneity and isotropy problems. As it stands, our scenario
appears to most easily produce extreme homogeneity, requiring structure to be
produced in the Standard Big Bang epoch. Producing significant perturbations
during the earlier epoch would require a rather careful design of the function
$c(t)$. The large entropy inside the horizon nowadays can also be accounted for
in this scenario.

Title:The Signature of Dark Matter in Quasar Light Curves,"
Abstract:  The idea that dark matter in the form of small compact bodies (most plausibly
planetary mass primordial black holes) betrays its presence by the microlensing
of quasars, has been stimulated by statistical studies of quasar light curves
and gravitationally lensed quasar systems. In this paper we review this
evidence, and discuss the significance of the recent detection of a planetary
mass microlensing event in the Galaxy by the MACHO group. We also look in more
detail at the light curves themselves, and make the case that many show the
characteristic morphology of caustic crossing events associated with a large
optical depth of lenses. This supports the idea that a large fraction of the
critical density is in the form of planetary mass compact bodies. The nature of
such bodies is discussed, and it is argued that current work on the QCD phase
transition suggests they are primordial black holes, although it is just
possible that they are compact gas clouds.

Title:Searching for Granularity of the Vacuum,"
Abstract:  The hypothesis is considered that the vacuum is a Lorentz non-invariant foam
in which translational symmetry is spontaneously broken at the Planck or grand
unification scale. This could possibly be observed via Rayleigh scattering of
ultrahigh energy quanta, and it appears to be ruled out for spin 1/2 leptons
and independently testable for photons. A weaker version of the hypothesis
predicts (for otherwise massless neutrinos) irreversible neutrino mixing over a
length scale of $l_{Planck}(E_{\nu}/E_{Planck})^{-2}$ in comoving cosmic
coordinates for a purely four dimensional universe, and, for neutrinos that
have spin 3/2 in a higher dimensional manifold above the energy scale $\eta
E_{Planck}$, the mixing is predicted to take place over a scale of $\eta^{-4}$
times this length. Such neutrino mixing might also be observable with
atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments.

Abstract:  We analyse a generalisation of general relativity that incorporates a cosmic

solutions for Friedmann universes and determine the rate of variation of $c$

Potential problems with this approach to the resolution of the flatness and
classical cosmological constant problems are highlighted. Reformulations are
suggested which give the theory a more desirable limit as a theory of varying
$G$ in the limit of constant $c$ and its relationship to theories with varying
electron charge and constant $c$ are discussed.

Title:On Gravitomagnetic Precession and Qpo in Black Hole Candidates,"
Abstract:  The X-ray observation of black hole candidates provides a valuable tool to
probe regions very close to the central black hole, where strong-field
relativistic effects become important. Recent studies have shown that these
effects seem to manifest themselves in the observed X-ray spectrum, in terms of
the shape of X-ray continuum and the profile of emission lines, and in the
X-ray light curves, in terms of certain quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). The
latter will be the focus of this paper. We will review the proposed
observational evidence for gravitomagnetic precession in black hole candidates,
in light of new observational data and alternative models. Quantitative
comparison will be made between the data and the models. We will comment on
recent theoretical and observational efforts to address whether the
gravitomagnetic precession of accreted, orbiting matter around a rotating black
hole is a viable process for producing the observed QPOs. The results are
inconclusive. We will mention a few areas where further progress can be made to
possibly shed more light on the issue.

Abstract:  We discuss the first results of our ongoing program of Target of Opportunity
observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using the SCUBA instrument on the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We present the results for GRB 970508, 971214, 980326,
980329, 980519, and 980703.
Our most important result to date is the detection of a fading counterpart to
GRB 980329 at 850 microns. Although it proved to be difficult to find the
infrared counterpart to this burst, the sub-millimeter flux was relatively
bright. This indicates that intrinsically the brightness of this counterpart
was very similar to GRB 970508. The radio through sub-millimeter spectrum of
GRB 980329 is well fit by a power law with index alpha = +0.9. However, we
cannot exclude a nu^(1/3) power law attenuated by synchrotron self-absorption.
An alpha = +1 VLA-SCUBA power law spectrum is definitely ruled out for GRB
980703, and possibly also for GRB 980519.
We cannot rule out that part of the sub-millimeter flux from GRB 980329 comes
from a dusty star-forming galaxy at high redshift, such as the ones recently
discovered by SCUBA. Any quiescent dust contribution will be much larger at
sub-millimeter than at radio wavelengths. Both a high redshift and large dust
extinction would help explain the reddening of the counterpart to GRB 980329,
and a redshift of z = 5 has been suggested. The large intensity of this burst
might then indicate that beaming is important.

Abstract:  We analyze the effect of the quadrupole component in the mass distribution of
a rapidly rotating neutron star on energy release in the boundary layer on the
surface of the accreting star and in the accretion disk in the cases where the
stellar radius is smaller (or larger) than the radius of the marginally stable
circular orbit. We calculate the velocities and trajectories of the particles
that fall on the stellar surface from the marginally stable orbit for a low-
luminosity accreting source. The corresponding external gravitational field of
the star is modeled by a new exact solution of the Einstein equations in
vacuum. The parameters of this solution are adjusted by reconciling the
numerical data for the radius of the marginally stable orbit and the
gravitational redshift of Cook et al. (1994) with the corresponding data in the
analytical solution. For various equations of state, we consider 1.4 solar mass
normal sequences and maximum mass normal sequences.

Interferometer in 1997. iota~Pegasi is a double-lined binary system whose
minimum masses and spectral typing suggests the possibility of eclipses. Our
orbital and component diameter determinations do not favor the eclipse

other means. In particular, the orbital parallax of the system is determined to
be 86.9 +/- 1.0 mas, and masses of the two components are determined to be

Abstract:  We have investigated the structure and evolution of hot gas in the 30 Dor

diffuse X-ray emission arises in blister-shaped regions outlined by loops of
HII gas. X-ray spectroscopic data from ASCA confirm the thermal nature of the
emission and indicate that hot gas temperature decreases from the core to the
halo of the nebula. The structure of the nebula can be understood as outflows
of hot and HII gases from the parent giant molecular cloud of the central OB
association. The dynamic mixing between the two gas phases is likely
responsible for the mass loading to the hot gas, as required to explain the
observed thermal structure and X-ray luminosity of the nebula. Such processes
should also be important in the formation of similar giant HII regions and in
their subsequent evolution into supergiant bubbles or galactic chimneys.

Because kinematic data for elliptical galaxies are now available out to several

Abstract:  We present models for the interstellar medium in disk galaxies. In
particular, we investigate whether the ISM in low surface brightness galaxies
can support a significant fraction of molecular gas given their low metallicity
and surface density. It is found that the abundance and line brightness of CO
in LSB galaxies is small and typically below current observational limits.
Still, depending on physical details of the ISM, the fraction of gas in the
form of molecular hydrogen can be significant in the inner few kpc of a low
surface brightness galaxy. This molecular gas would be at temperatures of
$\sim$ 30 -- 50 K, rather higher than in high surface brightness galaxies.
These results may help explain the star forming properties and inferred

Abstract:  We report the discovery of trailing grand-design nuclear spiral structure in

than 1 arcsec (~75 pc), emanate at 1 arcsec outside the quiescent nucleus of

optics results with traditional near-infrared and optical imaging, we show that
spiral structure is present in this galaxy at spatial scales covering two
orders of magnitude, from a hundred parsecs to 15 kpc. Comparison with a Hubble
Space Telescope ultraviolet image shows how the location of the circumnuclear
star formation relates to the nuclear spiral structure. We briefly discuss

Title:Stellar Absorption Lines in the Spectra of Seyfert Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We have measured the strengths of Ca II Triplet and Mgb stellar absorption
lines in the nuclear and off-nuclear spectra of Seyfert galaxies. These
features are diluted to varying degrees by continuum emission from the active
nucleus and from young stars. Ca II Triplet strengths can be enhanced if
late-type supergiant stars dominate the near-IR light. Thus, objects with
strong Ca II Triplet and weak Mgb lines may be objects with strong bursts of
star formation. We find that for most of our sample the line strengths are at
least consistent with dilution of a normal galaxy spectrum by a power law
continuum, in accord with the standard model for AGN. However, for several
Seyferts in our sample, it appears that dilution by a power law continuum
cannot simultaneously explain strong Ca II Triplet and relatively weak Mgb.
Also, these objects occupy the region of the IRAS color-color diagram
characteristic of starburst galaxies. In these objects it appears that the
optical to near-IR emission is dominated by late-type supergiants produced in a
circumnuclear burst of star formation.

Abstract:  We have reanalyzed the Large Magellanic Cloud's (LMC) ultraviolet (UV)
extinction using data from the IUE final archive. Our new analysis takes
advantage of the improved signal--to--noise of the IUE NEWSIPS reduction, the
exclusion of stars with very low reddening, the careful selection of well
matched comparison stars, and an analysis of the effects of Galactic foreground
dust. Differences between the average extinction curves of the 30 Dor region
and the rest of the LMC are reduced compared to previous studies. We find that
there is a group of stars with very weak 2175 Ang. bumps that lie in or near
the region occupied by the supergiant shell, LMC 2, on the southeast side of 30
Dor. The average extinction curves inside and outside LMC 2 show a very
significant difference in 2175 Ang. bump strength, but their far--UV
extinctions are similar. While it is unclear whether or not the extinction
outside the LMC 2 region can be fit with the relation of Cardelli, Clayton and
Mathis (CCM), sightlines near LMC 2 cannot be fit with CCM due to their weak
2175 Ang. bumps. While the extinction properties seen in the LMC lie within the
range of properties seen in the Galaxy, the correlations of UV extinction
properties with environment seen in the Galaxy do not appear to hold in the
LMC.

Title:Reconnection in a Weakly Stochastic Field,"
Abstract:  We examine the effect of weak, small scale magnetic field structure on the
rate of reconnection in a strongly magnetized plasma. This affects the rate of
reconnection by reducing the transverse scale for reconnection flows, and by
allowing many independent flux reconnection events to occur simultaneously.
Allowing only for the first effect and using Goldreich and Sridhar's model of
strong turbulence in a magnetized plasma with negligible intermittency, we find
that the lower limit for the reconnection speed is the Alfven speed times the
Lundquist number to the power (-3/16). The upper limit on the reconnection
speed is typically a large fraction of Alfven speed. We argue that generic
reconnection in turbulent plasmas will normally occur at close to this upper
limit. The fraction of magnetic energy that goes directly into electron heating
scales as Lundquist number to the power (-2/5) and the thickness of the current
sheet scales as the Lundquist number to the power (-3/5). A significant
fraction of the magnetic energy goes into high frequency Alfven waves. We claim
that the qualitative sense of these conclusions, that reconnection is fast even
though current sheets are narrow, is almost independent of the local physics of
reconnection and the nature of the turbulent cascade. As the consequence of
this the Galactic and Solar dynamos are generically fast, i.e. do not depend on
the plasma resistivity.

Title:Near-Infrared Microlensing of Stars by the Super-Massive Black Hole in the Galactic Center,"
Abstract:  We investigate microlensing amplification of faint stars in the dense stellar
cluster in the Galactic Center (GC) by the super-massive black hole (BH). Such
events would appear very close to the position of the radio source SgrA*, which
is thought to coincide with the BH, and could be observed during the monitoring
of stellar motions in the GC. We use the observed K-band (2.2 um) luminosity
function (KLF) in the GC and in Baade's Window, as well as stellar population
synthesis computations, to construct KLF models for the inner 300 pc of the
Galaxy. These, and the observed dynamical properties of this region, are used
to compute the rates of microlensing events, which amplify stars above
specified detection thresholds. We present computations of the lensing rates
and amplifications as functions of the event durations (weeks to years), for a
range of detection thresholds. We find that short events dominate the total
rate and that long events tend to have large amplifications. For the current
detection limit of K=17 mag, the total microlensing rate is 0.003 1/yr, and the
rate of events with durations >1 yr is 0.001 1/yr. Recent GC proper motion
studies have revealed the possible presence of one or two variable K-band
sources very close to SgrA* (Genzel et al 97; Ghez et al 98). These sources may
have attained peak brightnesses of K~15 mag, about 1.5-2 mag above the
observational detection limits, and appear to have varied on a timescale of ~1
yr. This behavior is consistent with long-duration microlensing of faint stars
by the BH. However, we estimate that the probability that such an event could
have been detected during the course of the recent proper motion studies is
\~0.5%. A ten-fold improvement in the detection limit and 10 yr of monthly
monitoring would increase the total detection probability to ~20%. (Abridged)

Title:What Grain Alignment can Tell about Circumstellar Disks and Comets,"
Abstract:  Grain alignment theory suggests that grains should be aligned in
circumstellar regions and the observational data available supports this
conclusion. We discuss the alignment of grains via (1) magnetic relaxation, (2)
mechanical processes, and (3) radiative torques. We show that ferromagnetic
relaxation is likely to be more important than superparamagnetic relaxation if
the dust in circumstellar regions is similar to species recently captured in
Earth atmosphere. Outflows and stellar winds provide grain streaming along
magnetic field lines and therefore mechanical alignment competes with the
ferromagnetic and radiative alignments. We estimate measures of grain alignment
in circumstellar regions, comets and interplanetary space and conclude that in
many circumstellar regions and in the interplanetary space radiative torques
may constitue the major alignment mechanism which aligns grain longer axes
perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field. Observations in submillimeter
and microwave ranges are suggested as a means of disentangling effects of
multiple scattering from those related to aligned grains.

4:1 axis ratio, or/and grains formed via agglomeration inelastic relaxation
dominates the Barnett relaxation within large (a>0.1 micron) grains even when
they rotate at thermal rate. For grains with axis ratio less than 1:2 the

predictions of classical Davis-Greenstein relaxation and the process which we

Abstract:  Asteroids and comets dissipate energy when they rotate about the axis
different from the axis of the maximal moment of inertia. We show that the most
efficient internal relaxation happens at the double frequency of body's
tumbling. Therefore the earlier estimates that ignore double frequency input
underestimate the internal relaxation in asteroids and comets. We show that the
Earth seismological data may poorly represent acoustic properties of asteroids
and comet as internal relaxation increases in the presence of moisture. At the
same time owing to non-linearlity of inelastic relaxation small angle nutations
can persist for very long time spans, but our ability to detect such
precessions is limited by the resolution of the radar-generated images.
Wobbling may provide valuable information on the composition and structure of
asteroids and on their recent history of external impacts.

"Title:Microwave Emission by Dust: Mechanisms, Properties and Prospects for ISM Studies","
Abstract:  I review my work with Bruce Draine on dust emissivity at microwave
frequencies (3 cm - 3 mm). This emissivity explains the recently detected
""anomalous"" component of the galactic foreground emission. Both small (a<0.001
micron) and large grains contribute to this emission. Small grains have
electric dipole moments and emit while they rotate; the microwave emission of
large grains is mostly due to magneto-dipole radiation. Most efficient
magneto-dipole emitters are strongly magnetic, e.g. ferrimagnetic or
ferromagnetic, materials. The relative role of the two mechanisms can be
established through observations of microwave emissivity from dark clouds. New
microwave window is a window of opportunity for interstellar studies. Magnetic
fields inside dark clouds may be successfully studied via microwave
polarization. Microwave emissivity constrains the abundance of strongly
magnetic materials. For instance, the available data at 90 GHz indicate that
not more than 5% of interstellar Fe is in the form of metallic iron grains or
inclusions (e.g., in ``GEMS''). Future missions, e.g. MAP and PLANCK, will
bring a wealth of microwave data that can be successfully used to study ISM.
Such a study would be appreciated by cosmologists who franticly try to remove

Title:Turbulent Cooling Flows in Molecular Clouds,"
Abstract:  We propose that inward, subsonic flows arise from the local dissipation of
turbulent motions in molecular clouds. Such ""turbulent cooling flows"" may
account for recent observations of spatially extended inward motions towards
dense cores. These pressure-driven flows may arise from various types of
turbulence and dissipation mechanisms. For the example of MHD waves and
turbulence damped by ion-neutral friction, sustained cooling flow requires that
the outer gas be sufficiently turbulent, that the inner gas have marginal
field-neutral coupling, and that this coupling decrease sufficiently rapidly
with increasing density. These conditions are most likely met at the transition
between outer regions ionized primarily by UV photons and inner regions ionized
primarily by cosmic rays. If so, turbulent cooling flows can help form dense
cores, with speeds faster than expected for ambipolar diffusion. Such motions
could reduce the time needed for dense core formation and could precede and
enhance the motions of star-forming gravitational infall.

simulations, we compute the expected X-ray background (XRB) from the diffuse
IGM with the clumping factor expected from gravitational shock heating. The
predicted fluxes and temperatures are excluded from the observed XRB. The
predicted clumping can be reduced by entropy injection. The required energy is
computed from the two-point correlation function, as well as from
Press-Schechter formalisms. The minimal energy injection of 1 keV/nucleon
excludes radiative or gravitational heating as a primary energy source. We
argue that the intergalactic medium (IGM) must have been heated through violent
processes such as massive supernova bursts. If the heating proceeded through
supernova explosions, it likely proceeded in bursts which may be observable in
high redshift supernova searches. Within our model we reproduce the observed
cluster luminosity-temperature relation with energy injection of 1 keV/nucleon
if this injection is assumed to be uncorrelated with the local density. These
parameters predict that the diffuse IGM soft XRB has a temperature of ~1 keV
with a flux near 10 keV/cm^2 s str keV, which may be detectable in the near
future.

Abstract:  We analyze the star formation activity of an homogeneous
LSB dwarf galaxy sample in the Virgo cluster, as a function of the radial
velocity relative to the cluster mean velocity and the projected distance from
the center of the cluster, using CCD images obtained at the Wise Observatory.
The localized H$\alpha$ emission in the HII regions of this sample is

of a representative sample of Blue Compact Dwarf
(BCD) galaxies in the cluster.

Title:Hydrodynamics of Accretion onto Black Holes,"
Abstract:  Spherical and axisymmetric accretion onto black holes is discussed. Physical
processes in various families of solutions are explained and their
characteristics are summarized. Recently discovered solutions of axisymmetric
flow provide us with various radiation efficiency and spectrum, which may
successfully model diverse accretion systems. Possible role of preheating is
also speculated. The various families of solutions can be plotted as
trajectories on the plane of (l,e) [or (l,dot m)] where l is the luminosity in
units of the Eddington luminosity, dot m is the similarly defined mass
accretion rate and e is the efficiency defined by e equiv L/dot M c^2 = l/dot
m. We discuss the domains on these planes where solutions are known or expected
to be unstable to either spherical or on-spherical perturbations. Preliminary
analysis indicates that a preheating instability will occur along the polar
direction of the advection dominated flow for e \gsim 10^{-2}.

Title:The complex X-ray spectra of active galaxies with warm absorbers,"
Abstract:  Warm absorbers are an important new probe of the central regions of active
galaxies. So far, they revealed their existence mainly in the soft X-ray
spectral region. In observing and modeling this component, we can learn a lot
about the nature of the warm absorber itself, its relation to other components
of the active nucleus, and the intrinsic AGN X-ray spectral shape.
Here, we briefly review the basic X-ray spectral features of warm absorbers
(dust-free WAs, dusty WAs, peculiar ~1.1 keV absorption, emission and
reflection components) and then discuss these in more detail based on analyses
of individual objects observed with the X-ray satellite ROSAT. The importance
of XMM in improving our knowledge of the warm material is discussed.

Title:High-resolution imaging of Einstein Slew Survey BL Lacertae objects,"
Abstract:  High-resolution images of 7 newly identified BL Lac objects (among them one
BL Lac candidate) at z < 0.2 from the Einstein Slew Survey are presented for
the first time. In all cases we were able to resolve the host galaxy. Our
2-dimensional analysis of the host galaxies shows that all these BL Lac objects
are embedded in elliptical galaxies with an average M_R = -23.1 and r_e = 10
kpc. One BL Lac might have both a bulge and an underlying disk. These results
are similar to those obtained for the hosts of other BL Lac objects.
We searched in our BL Lac objects for host galaxies, whose surface brightness
distribution does not follow a pure de Vaucouleurs law and determined the
statistical significance with numerical simulations. In two BL Lac objects (1ES
1255+244 and 1ES 1959+650) significant deviations were found.
The environments of the BL Lac objects are highly interesting. In at least
two (perhaps three) cases we found evidence for interaction. All BL Lac objects
(except one) have at least 2 companions, some of which are bright, within a
projected distance of 60 kpc from the BL Lac. In two cases we found 5
companions within 50 kpc. This implies that gravitational interaction is
potentially important to the BL Lac phenomenon at least in these sources.

Title:Centaurus A - NGC 5128,"
Abstract:  This review summarizes the state of the knowledge of the nearby (D = 3.4 Mpc)
radio source Centaurus A and its host galaxy NGC 5128. The massive elliptical
host galaxy appears to be moderately triaxial. It contains a strongly warped
thin disk, rich in gas, dust and young stars, and roughly aligned with the
minor axis of the elliptical galaxy. This and other evidence suggests that NGC
5128 has experienced a major merger at least once in its past. The subparsec
nucleus is variable at radio and X-ray wavelengths and is probably powered by
accretion onto a black hole of moderate mass. HI and molecular line absorption
against the nucleus suggest significal inflow of material. Linear radio/X-ray
jets emanating from the nucleus become subrelativistic at a few parsec, expand
into plumes at about 5 kpc, and then turn into huge radio lobes extending out
to 250 kpc. A compact disk surrounds the nucleus. It is not aligned with any of
the principal axes of the elliptical galaxy, but perpendicular to the inner
jets. The jet-collimating mechanism, probably tied to this circumnuclear disk,
appears to be precessing on timescales of a times 10**7 yerars.

Title:Frame dragging and other precessional effects in black hole-pulsar binaries,"
Abstract:  For radio pulsars in orbit with a compact companion, pulsar timing
observations have proved to be a powerful tool for identifying the physical
nature of the companion. Unfortunately, perhaps the most intriguing system
where such a tool could be used, a pulsar in orbit with a black hole, has yet
to be discovered. In this paper we give a detailed investigation of what one
can learn about the black hole companion via timing observations of the pulsar.
We present an analytic calculation for the propagation delay caused by the
frame-dragging effect and show that it has the same functional behavior as the
modulation of the observed rotational phase of the pulsar caused by the
deflection of the radio signals in the gravitational field of the companion
(bending delay). Thus, contrary to statements of other authors, the
frame-dragging delay is unlikely to be separately measurable in pulsar binaries
where the companion is a stellar mass black hole. We demonstrate, however, that
the precession of the binary orbit caused by the relativistic spin-orbit
coupling can lead to observable effects which can be used to set a lower limit
to the black-hole spin, or possibly allow the determination of its magnitude
and orientation. We give parameter estimates for two possible systems, a 10
solar mass black hole in orbit either with a young (~0.1 s) pulsar or with a
millisecond pulsar. Finally, we discuss the measurability of the quadrupole
moment of the rotating black hole companion which would test the presence of a
Kerr black hole. As an interesting side result of our calculations, we can give
a further argument why the companion of PSR J0045-7319 cannot be a Kerr black
hole.

Title:The Extreme Outer Regions of Disk Galaxies: Star Formation and Metal Abundances,"
Abstract:  The extreme outer regions of disk galaxies, lying at or beyond the classical
optical radius defined by R25, present an opportunity to study star formation
and chemical evolution under unique physical conditions, possibly reminscent of
those which existed during the early stages of disk evolution. We present here
some of the first results from a large study to measure star formation rates
and metallicities in the extreme outer limits of a sample of nearby spiral
galaxies. Despite their low gas column densities, massive star formation is
often observed in these outer parts, but at an azimuthally--averaged rate much
lower than that seen in the inner disk. Gas-phase O/H abundances of roughly 10%
solar characterize the gas at 1.5--2 R25. The implications of our results for
star formation `laws' and models of disk evolution are discussed.

Title:Warped accretion discs and the long periods in X-ray binaries,"
Abstract:  Precessing accretion discs have long been suggested as explanations for the
long periods observed in a variety of X-ray binaries, most notably Her X-1/HZ
Her. We show that an instability of the disc's response to the radiation
reaction force from the illumination by the central source can cause the disc
to tilt out of the orbital plane and precess in something like the required
manner. The rate of precession and disc tilt obtained for realistic values of
system parameters compare favourably with the known body of data on X-ray
binaries with long periods. We explore other possible types of behaviour than
steadily precessing discs that might be observable in systems with somewhat
different parameters. At high luminosities, the inner disc tilts through more
than 90 degrees, i.e. it rotates counter to the usual direction, which may
explain the torque reversals in systems such as 4U 1626-67.

Title:Local Hydrodynamic Stability of Accretion Disks,"
Abstract:  We employ a variety of numerical simulations in the local shearing box system
to investigate in greater depth the local hydrodynamic stability of Keplerian
differential rotation. In particular we explore the relationship of Keplerian
shear to the nonlinear instabilities known to exist in simple Cartesian shear.
The Coriolis force is the source of linear stabilization in differential
rotation. We exploit the formal equivalence of constant angular momentum flows
and simple Cartesian shear to examine the transition from stability to
nonlinear instability. The manifestation of nonlinear instability in shear
flows is known to be sensitive to initial perturbation and to the amount of
viscosity; marginally (linearly) stable differentially rotating flows exhibit
this same sensitivity. Keplerian systems, however, are completely stable; the
strength of the stabilizing Coriolis force easily overwhelms any destabilizing
nonlinear effects. In fact, nonlinear effects speed the decay of applied
turbulence by producing a rapid cascade of energy to high wavenumbers where
dissipation occurs. Our conclusions are tested with grid resolution experiments
and by comparison with results from a code that employs an alternative
numerical algorithm. The properties of hydrodynamic differential rotation are
contrasted with magnetohydrodynamic differential rotation. The kinetic stress
couples to the vorticity which limits turbulence, while the magnetic stress
couples to the shear which promotes turbulence. Thus magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence is uniquely capable of acting as a turbulent angular momentum
transport mechanism in disks.

Title:The Shapes of Elliptical Galaxies with Central Density Cusps and Massive Dark Objects,"
Abstract:  For a sample of 22 core ellipticals and 22 power law ellipticals, I examine
the apparent axis ratios of isophotes as a function of the dynamical time at
the isophote's mean radius. The two types of elliptical galaxy have a
significantly different distribution of shapes in the region where the
dynamical time is short (about 1 Myr); the core galaxies are rounder in this
region. In the outer regions, the two types have indistinguishable shape
distributions. I perform a more detailed analysis of the apparent and intrinsic
shapes at two chosen locations: a inner region, where the dynamical time is
0.75 Myr, and an outer region, where the dynamical time is 50 Myr. The inner
isophotes of core galaxies are consistent with their being randomly oriented
oblate objects, with a peak intrinsic axis ratio of c/a = 0.86. The outer
regions of core galaxies are inconsistent with their being randomly oriented
oblate or prolate objects. The oblate hypothesis cannot be rejected for the
inner and outer regions of power law ellipticals at the 90% confidence level.
The observed shapes are consistent with the hypothesis that the inner regions
of core galaxies are nearly spherical and nearly axisymmetric, perhaps as the
result of the physical process which formed the core.

Title:X-rays From Magnetic Flares In Cygnus X-1: The Role Of A Transition Layer,"
Abstract:  The spectrum of Seyfert 1 Galaxies is very similar to that of several
Galactic Black Hole Candidates (GBHCs) in their hard state, suggestive that
both classes of objects have similar physical processes. While it appears that
an accretion disk corona (ADC) model, where the corona sandwiches the cold
accretion disk, is capable of explaining the observations of Seyfert galaxies,
recent work has shown that this model is problematic for GBHCs. To address the
differences in the spectra of Seyferts and GBHCs, we consider the structure of
the atmosphere of the accretion disk in a region near an active magnetic flare
(we refer to this region as transition layer). We show that the transition
layer is subject to a thermal instability. Due to the much higher ionizing
X-ray flux in GBHCs, the only stable solution for the upper layer of the
accretion disk is that in which it is highly ionized and is at the Compton
temperature ($kT \sim $ a few keV). Using numerical simulations for a slab
geometry ADC, we show that the presence of a transition layer can significantly
alter the spectrum of escaping radiation for modest optical depths. The
presence of the transition layer also leads to a reduction in reprocessing
features, i.e., the iron line and the X-ray reflection hump. We find that due
to the thermal instability of the surface of the accretion disk, which leads to
different endpoints for GBHCs and Seyfert galaxies, the X-ray spectra from
these two types of objects can be explained by a single unifying ADC model.

Title:Toward a dust penetrated classification of the evolved stellar Population II disks of galaxies,"
Abstract:  (abridged): To derive a coherent physical framework for the excitation of
spiral structure in galaxies, one must consider the co-existence of two
different dynamical components: a gas-dominated Population I disk (OB
associations, HII regions, cold interstellar HI gas) and an evolved stellar
Population II component. The Hubble classification scheme has as its focus, the
morphology of the Population I component only. In the near-infrared, the
morphology of evolved stellar disks indicates a simple classification scheme:
the dominant Fourier m-mode in the dust penetrated regime, and the associated
pitch angle. On the basis of deprojected K$'$ (2.1$\mu m$) images, we propose
that the evolved stellar disks may be grouped into three principal dust
penetrated archetypes: those with tightly wound stellar arms characterised by
pitch angles at K$'$ of $\sim$ 10$^{\circ}$ (the $\alpha$ class), an
intermediate group with pitch angles of $\sim$ 25$^{\circ}$ (the $\beta$ class)
and thirdly, those with open spirals demarcated by pitch angles at K$'$ of
$\sim$ 40$^{\circ}$ (the $\gamma$ bin). Both optically flocculent or grand
design galaxies can reside within the {\it same} dust penetrated morphological
bin. Any specific dust penetrated archetype may be the resident disk of {\it
both} an early or late type galaxy in the optical regime. There is no
correlation between our dust penetrated classes and optical Hubble binning; the
Hubble tuning fork does not constrain the morphology of the old stellar
Population II disks.

Title:The Physics of Accretion Disks with Magnetic Flares,"
Abstract:  Rapid progress in multi-wavelength observations of Seyfert Galaxies in recent
years is providing evidence that X-ray emission in these objects may be
produced by magnetic flares occurring above a cold accretion disk. Here we
attempt to develop a physically consistent model of accretion disks producing
radiation via magnetic flares as well as the optically thick intrinsic disk
emission. We place a special emphasis on comparison of the theory and the
observations of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and Galactic Black Hole Candidates
(GBHCs). In particular, theoretical issues considered in this work provide
tentative explanations for: (1) the origin of the Big Blue Bump of Seyfert 1
Galaxies. (2) the recently discovered X-ray Baldwin effect and the controversy
over the existence of BBBs in quasars more luminous than typical Seyferts. (3)
The differences and similarities in X-ray spectra of Galactic Black Hole
Candidates and Seyfert 1s. (4) The hard/soft state transitions of GBHCs and
AGN.
Our conclusion is that the agreement between the theory and observations is
very encouraging and we thus suggest that the physics of magnetic flares is the
physics that should be added to the standard accretion disk theory in order to
produce a more realistic description of radiation from accretion flows with a
large angular momentum.

Title:Re-examination of the possible tidal stream in front of the LMC,"
Abstract:  It has recently been suggested that the stars in a vertical extension of the
red clump feature seen in LMC color-magnitude diagrams could belong to a tidal
stream of material located in front of that galaxy. If this claim is correct,
this foreground concentration of stars could contribute significantly to the
rate of gravitational microlensing events observed in the LMC microlensing
experiments. Here we present radial velocity measurements of stars in this
so-called ``vertical red clump'' (VRC) population. The observed stellar sample,
it transpires, has typical LMC kinematics. It is shown that it is improbable
that an intervening tidal stream should have the same distribution of radial
velocities as the LMC, which is consistent with an earlier study that showed
that the VRC feature is more likely a young stellar population in the main body
of that galaxy. However, the kinematic data do not discriminate against the
possibility that the VRC is an LMC halo population.

LMXBs in Galactic globular clusters and in the Large Magellanic Cloud using the
ROSAT PSPC. We find a trend in the X-ray properties of the LMXBs as a function
of globular cluster metallicity. The spectra of LMXBs become progressively
softer as the metallicity of its environment increases. The one M31 globular
cluster LMXB in our sample which has a metallicity greater than solar has
spectral properties similar to those of LMXBs in the bulge of M31, but markedly
different from those which reside in low metallicity globular clusters, both in
M31 and the Galaxy. The spectral properties of this high metallicity LMXB is
also similar to those of X-ray faint early-type galaxies. This lends support to
the claim that a majority of the X-ray emission from these X-ray faint
early-type galaxies results from LMXBs and not hot gas, as is the case in their

Abstract:  We explore the hypothesis that clouds detected in quasar absorption line

of halo clouds increase with increasing distance from the central galaxy,
velocity resolved profiles of highly ionized gas are predicted to have a
greater width than low ionization gas. A line of sight passing through the
center of gaseous halo (an idealized damped Ly alpha system), yields low
ionization absorption at the velocity of the galaxy, flanked by high ionization
on either side. Reasonable halo parameters yield total velocity extents for C
IV of v_{C IV}=100-200 km/s, in agreement with several observed systems. The
remaining systems may better described by the rotating disk model of Prochaska

Abstract:  We present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of redshifted
HI 21cm absorption in two low redshift (z=0.2212, z=0.0912) damped Lyman-alpha
systems seen towards the gigahertz peaked source OI 363 (z_em = 0.630). The
object at z=0.0912 is the lowest redshift damped Lyman-alpha system known to
date. Ground based imaging (Rao & Turnshek, 1998) shows that at neither
redshift is there a large spiral galaxy at low impact parameter to the line of
sight to OI 363, in contradiction with the suggestion that these systems are
large proto-disks.
Since OI 363 is a highly compact, core dominated source, the covering factor
of the HI gas is likely to be unity. Nonetheless, the spin temperatures derived
from the 21cm optical depth (and using the N_HI measured from HST spectra, Rao
& Turnshek, 1998) are high, viz. 1120 +/- 200 K and 825 +/- 110 K for the high
and low redshift systems respectively. These values are considerably higher
than typical values (100 - 200 K) measured in our Galaxy and Andromeda and are,
in fact, similar to those obtained in high redshift damped Lyman-alpha systems.
Our observations hence suggest that evolutionary effects may not be crucial in
understanding the difference in derived spin temperature values between local
spiral disks and high redshift damped Lyman-alpha systems.

ROSAT HRI and PSPC observations of the edge-on starburst galaxy NGC 253. In
this first paper, point-like X-ray sources detected within the galaxy and in
the field are discussed.
In total, 73 X-ray sources have been collected in the NGC 253 field, 32 of
which are associated with the disk of the galaxy. Though 27 of these disk
sources are detected with the HRI (some being resolvable with the PSPC), the
remaining 5 PSPC-only detected sources are likely not to be real point sources,
being instead due to fluctuations within the X-ray structure of the disk. The
source close to the center of the galaxy is extended (L_x = 1e39 erg/s in the
ROSAT 0.1-2.4 keV band), and is most likely associated with the nuclear
starburst activity. The remaining sources have luminosities ranging from 7e36
erg/s to 3e38 erg/s, yielding an integrated point source luminosity of 1e39
erg/s.
The halo of NGC 253 is filled with diffuse, filamentary X-ray emission. Seven
sources are located (or projected) in this diffuse emission region. Time
variability arguments, together with optical identifications, are put forward
to explain 4 sources as background objects, the other 3 sources likely being
spurious detections caused by local enhancements in the diffuse emission of the

equivalent width as a function of both the column density derived from the
photoelectric cutoff and the 2-10 keV flux normalized to the [OIII] optical
line flux (the latter corrected for extinction and assumed to be a true
indicator of the source intrinsic luminosity). We find that the hard X-ray
properties of type 2 objects depend on a single parameter, the absorbing column
density along the line of sight,in accordance with the unified model. The
diagram can be used to identify Compton thick sources and to isolate and study
peculiar objects. From this analysis we have obtained a column density
distribution of Seyfert 2 galaxies which is thought to be a good approximation
of the real distribution. A large population of heavily absorbed objects is
discovered, including many Compton thick candidates. Our results indicate that

due to beaming will be much smaller in narrow-line radio galaxies than in
quasars: we therefore investigate in a similar manner, a sample of radio
galaxies with detected jets. We find that spectral asymmetries in these objects
are uncorrelated with jet sidedness at all brightness levels, but depend on
relative lobe volume. Our results are not in conflict with unified schemes, but
suggest that the differences between the two samples are due primarily to power
or redshift, rather than to orientation. We also show directly that hotspot
spectra steepen as a function of radio power or redshift. Whilst a shift in
observed frequency due to the redshift may account for some of the steepening,
it cannot account for all of it, and a dependence on radio power is required.

Title:On the validity of the core-mass luminosity relation for TP-AGB stars with efficient dredge-up,"
Abstract:  We investigate the validity of the core mass - luminosity relation (CMLR),
originally described by Paczynski (1970), for asymptotic giant branch stars
under the presence of third dredge-up events. We find, that models with
efficient third dredge-up with less massive cores than those associated with
hot bottom burning (Bloecker and Schoenberner 1991) do not obey the linear
CMLR. Complete evolutionary calculations of thermal pulse stellar models which
consider overshoot according to an exponential diffusive algorithm show
systematically larger third dredge-up for lower core masses (0.55 Msol < M_H <
0.8 Msol) than any other existing models. We present and discuss the luminosity
evolution of these models.

Title:Horizontal-Branch Stars: Their nature and their absolute magnitude,"
Abstract:  Horizontal-branch stars play an important role in defining the absolute
distance scale in the universe. For that one has to know Mv at relevant B-V
with well defined [M/H] for each type of horizontal-branch star. The nature of
the horizontal-branch stars is reviewed with emphasis on all the open questions
regarding evolution and structure, questions which show that these stars are
not the easiest objects in the distance scale discussions.
Using the HB stars with the best Hipparcos parallaxes, the HB at (B-V)o =
0.20 and [Fe/H] = -1.5 has Mv = +0.71. Assuming the [Fe/H] to Mv relation for
RR Lyrae stars to be valid for HB stars too, one finds Mv 1.00 for [Fe/H] = 0.

Title:The influence of geometry and topology on axisymmetric mean-field dynamos,"
Abstract:  We study the changes in the dynamical behaviour of axisymmetric spherical
mean-field dynamo models produced by changes in their geometry and topology, by
considering a two parameter family of models, ranging from a full sphere to
spherical shell, torus and disc-like configurations, within a unified
framework. We find that the two parameter space of the family of models
considered here separates into at least three different regions with distinct
characteristics for the onset of dynamo action. In two of these regions, the
most easily excited fields are oscillatory, in one case with dipolar symmetry,
and in the other with quadrupolar, whereas in the third region the most easily
excited field is steady and quadrupolar. In the nonlinear regime, we find that
topological changes can alter significantly the dynamical behaviour, whilst
modest changes in geometry can produce qualitative changes, particularly for
thin disc-like configurations. This is of potential importance, since the exact
shapes of astrophysical bodies, especially accretion discs and galaxies, are
usually not precisely known.

Title:X-Ray Evidence for Multiphase Hot Gas with Solar Abundances in the Brightest Elliptical Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We examine whether isothermal models of the hot gas can successfully describe
the ASCA and ROSAT spectra of NGC 1399, NGC 4472, NGC 4636, and NGC 5044.
Broad-band spectral fitting of the ASCA SIS and GIS data accumulated within a
radius of ~5 arcmin for each galaxy shows that isothermal models are unable to
fit the SIS data near 1 keV. In addition, these isothermal models typically
fail to produce the large equivalent widths of the K-alpha line blends of the
H-like and He-like ions of Si and S which are measured independently of the Fe
L emission lines. Two-temperature models provide excellent broad-band fits to
both the SIS and GIS data of each galaxy with the relative abundances (except
for NGC 4636) fixed at their solar values. A simple multiphase cooling flow
model fits nearly as well as the two-temperature model for NGC 1399, NGC 4472,
and NGC 5044. The multiphase models also predict more accurately the Si and S
equivalent widths and the ratios of Si XIV/XIII and S XVI/XV than the
isothermal models.
Using various approaches we find that the temperature gradients inferred from
the ROSAT PSPC data of these galaxies, especially for NGC 1399 and NGC 5044,
are inconsistent with the isothermal models derived from fitting the ASCA data
within a single-aperture but are very consistent with the multiphase models.
Therefore, models which assume isothermal gas within r ~5 arcmin are
inconsistent with both the ASCA and ROSAT PSPC data of these elliptical
galaxies. Simple two-temperature models and multiphase cooling flows provide
good descriptions of these data sets with Fe abundances of ~1-2 solar and
(except for NGC 4636) relative abundances fixed at their solar values. We
discuss the implications of these nearly solar abundances. (Abridged)

Title:Ionizing Photon Sources within the Local Group,"
Abstract:  We review the possible sources of ionizing photons within the Local Group.
Throughout most of the LG volume, the cosmic background radiation will
dominate, but locally (e.g., within d\sim 100 kpc of the Galactic disk) stellar
ionizing photons escaping from galaxies may dominate. The magnitude of the
cosmic ionizing background should be determined in the very near future by
observations of H alpha emission from the outer neutral hydrogen disks of
late-type spirals. The detection of the Magellanic Stream in H alpha suggests
that a few percent of the ionizing photons produced in the Galaxy escape the
disk. Neither a warm Local Group corona nor decay photons from a neutrino halo
can explain the Stream emission.

Title:A near-infrared study of the planetary nebula NGC 2346,"
Abstract:  This paper presents new near-infrared observations of the planetary nebula
NGC 2346. The data include a broad K-band image, an image in the H2
vibrationally excited 1-0S(1) line and K band slit spectra at three positions
in the nebula. In the H2 1-0S(1) line, the nebula is characterized by a
central, bright torus, surrounded by weaker emission with a typical butterfly
shape, as seen in Halpha and CO lines. The K band spectra show 11 H2 lines with
excitation energies from 6150 to 12552 K. The H2 data have been compared to the
predictions of models which follow the evolution with time of the H2 emission
in PNe of different core mass and shell properties (Natta & Hollenbach 1998).
These models compute the emission originating in the photodissociation region
(PDR) created at the inner edge of the neutral shell by the UV radiation of the
central core, as well as the emission in the shock associated to the expansion
of the shell inside the precursor red-giant wind. In NGC 2346, a PDR origin of
the H2 emission in a low-density molecular shell (n<~10^4 cm^-3) is indicated.
At these low densities, time-dependent H2 chemistry and X-ray heating of the
neutral gas enhance the predicted PDR H2 line intensity by large factors.

Abstract:  The Press & Schechter ``numerical recipe'' is briefly reviewed, together with
the recently proposed dynamical mass function theory, in which the mass
function is constructed by using the powerful Lagrangian perturbation theory.
The dynamical mass function is found in good agreement with the recent N-body

Universe. The definition of collapse, the relation between mass and smoothing
radius, and the definition of structure in 1D Universes are discussed. A

the orbit-crossed regions in the simulation are correctly reproduced, while the
fragmentation of the collapsed medium into structures cannot be done in a
univocal way. Finally, we try to answer the question: why the hell does the

Title:Simultaneous Multicolor Detection of Faint Galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field,"
Abstract:  We present a novel way to detect objects when multiband images are available.
Typically, object detection is performed in one of the available bands or on a
somewhat arbitrarily co-added image. Our technique provides an almost optimal
way to use all the color information available. We build up a composite image
of the N passbands where each pixel value corresponds to the probability that
the given pixel is just sky. By knowing the probability distribution of sky
pixels (a chi-square distribution with N degrees of freedom), the data can be
used to derive the distribution of pixels dominated by object flux. From the
two distributions an optimal segmentation threshold can be determined. Clipping
the probability image at this threshold yields a mask, where pixels unlikely to
be sky are tagged. After using a standard connected-pixel criterion, the
regions of this mask define the detected objects. Applying this technique to
the Hubble Deep Field data, we find that we can extend the detection limit of
the data below that possible using linearly co-added images. We also discuss
possible ways of enhancing object detection probabilities for certain well
defined classes of objects by using various optimized linear combinations of
the pixel fluxes (optimal subspace filtering).

Title:Multiple CO Outflows in Circinus: The Churning of a Molecular Cloud,"
Abstract:  We present a millimeter wave study of a cluster of bipolar CO outflows
embedded in the western end of the Circinus molecular cloud complex, G317-4,
that is traced by very high optical extinction. For an assumed distance of 700
pc, the entire Circinus cloud is estimated to have a mass of about 5E4 solar
masses. The opaque western portion that was mapped in this study has a mass of
about 10E3 solar masses, contains a number of embedded infrared sources and
various compact 1.3 mm continuum sources, and has a remarkable filamentary
structure with numerous cavities which appears to be the fossil remnants of
past star formation activity. The profusion of outflows in this region are
disentangled and linked to driving IRAS sources. Thus, the mapped portion of
Circinus contains at least 10 CO emitting molecular outflows. Assuming that
star formation has continued at a steady rate for the last several hundred
thousand years, the Circinus cloud is expected to have produced dozens of young
stars. Their outflows have severely altered the structure and kinematics of
this cloud as evidenced by the multitude of prominent cavities and dust
filaments that outline their boundaries. This level of star formation activity
is consistent with the numerous post-outflow phase H-alpha emission line stars
that have been found in this region. The Circinus cloud complex is an
archetypical case where star formation activity may have profoundly affected
the structure of a molecular cloud, producing its strikingly filamentary and
cavitated appearance and providing further evidence that star formation may be
a self regulated process.

Title:The Intermediate Line Region and the Baldwin Effect,"
Abstract:  Statistical investigations of samples of quasars have established that
clusters of properties are correlated. The strongest trends among the
ultraviolet emission-line properties are characterized by the object-to-object
variation of emission from low-velocity gas, the so-called ``intermediate-line
region'' or ILR. The strongest trends among the optical emission-line
properties are characterized by the object-to-object variation of the line
intensity ratio of [O III] 5007 to optical Fe II. Additionally, the strength of
ILR emission correlates with [O III]/Fe II, as well as with radio and X-ray
properties. The fundamental physical parameter driving these related
correlations is not yet identified. Because the variation in the ILR dominates
the variation in the equivalent widths of lines showing the Baldwin effect, it
is important to understand whether the physical parameter underlying this
variation also drives the Baldwin effect or is a primary source of scatter in
the Baldwin effect.

"Title:The peculiar motions of early-type galaxies in two distant regions - V. The Mg-sigma relation, age and metallicity","
Abstract:  We examine the Mg-sigma relation for early-type galaxies in the EFAR sample
and its dependence on cluster properties. A maximum likelihood fit gives global
Mg-sigma relations of Mgb'=0.131log(sigma)-0.131 and Mg2=0.257log(sigma)-0.305,
with intrinsic scatter of 0.016 mag in Mgb' and 0.023 mag in Mg2. The zeropoint
for cD galaxies is higher than for E/S0 galaxies, implying cDs are older and/or
more metal-rich than E/S0s with the same sigma. Mg-sigma zeropoint variations
between clusters are consistent with the number of galaxies observed per
cluster and the global intrinsic scatter in Mg-sigma. We find no significant
correlation between the Mg-sigma zeropoint and the cluster velocity dispersion,
X-ray luminosity or X-ray temperature over a wide range in cluster mass. We
compare the intrinsic scatter in the Mg-sigma and Fundamental Plane (FP)
relations with stellar population models to constrain the dispersion in ages,
metallicities and M/L ratios for early-type galaxies at fixed sigma. Variations
in age alone or metallicity alone cannot explain the measured intrinsic scatter
in both Mg-sigma and the FP. We derive the joint constraints on the dispersion
in age and metallicity implied by the scatter in the Mg-sigma and FP relations
for a simple Gaussian model. We find upper limits on the dispersions at fixed
sigma of 32% in dt/t and 38% in dZ/Z if variations in age and metallicity are
uncorrelated; only strongly anti-correlated variations lead to significantly
higher upper limits. The joint distribution of residuals from the Mg-sigma and
FP relations is only marginally consistent with a model having no correlation
between age and metallicity, and is better-matched by a model in which age and
metallicity variations are moderately anti-correlated, with younger galaxies
being more metal-rich. (Abridged)

Title:OH(1720 MHz) Masers at the Galactic Centre,"
Abstract:  OH(1720 MHz) masers permit direct measurements of the magnetic field strength
at the Galactic Centre, and their angular broadening constrains models for the
medium that scatters radio waves in the central 100 pc of the Galaxy. As the
1720 MHz masers are unaccompanied by the main-line masers at 1665 and 1667 MHz,
they must be pumped by collisions in molecular gas that is cooling after being
overrun by a non-dissociative (i.e. C-type) shock wave. In particular, this
confirms that the ``SNR'' Sgr A East is driving a shock into the M-0.02-0.07
molecular cloud. The intensity of the v=1--0 S(1) line of H_2 is consistent
with the shock strength expected to be driven into the molecular gas by the
pressure within Sgr A East.

Title:The enhancement and decrement of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect towards the ROSAT Cluster RXJ0658-5557,"
Abstract:  We report simultaneous observations at 1.2 and 2 mm, with a double channel
photometer on the SEST Telescope, of the X-ray cluster RXJ0658-5557 in search
for the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (S-Z). The S-Z data were analyzed using the
relativistically correct expression for the Comptonization parameter and we
find from the detected decrement (2.60 +/- 0.79) ~ 10^{-4}, which is consistent
with that computed using the X-ray (ROSAT and ASCA) observations. The
uncertainty includes contributions due to statistical uncertainty in the
detection and systematics and calibration. The 1.2 {mm} channel data alone
gives rise to a larger Comptonization parameter and this result is discussed in
terms of contamination from foreground sources and/or dust in the cluster or
from a possible systematic effect. We then make use of the combined analysis of
the ROSAT and ASCA X-ray satellite observations to determine an isothermal
model for the S-Z surface brightness. Since the cluster is asymmetrical and
probably in a merging process, models are only approximate. The associated
uncertainty can, however, be estimated by exploring a set of alternative
models. We then find as the global uncertainty on the Comptonization parameter
a factor of 1.3. Combining the S-Z and the X-ray measurements, we determine a
value for the Hubble constant. The 2 mm data are consistent with H_0(q_0 =
1/2)= 53^{+38}_{-28} km/s Mpc^{-1}, where the uncertainty is dominated by the
uncertainty in models of the X-ray plasma halo.

Abstract:  Neutral hydrogen synthesis mapping of NGC 4532 and DDO 137, a pair of Sm
galaxies on the edge of the Virgo cluster, is used to determine rotation curves
for each of the galaxies and to resolve the structure and kinematics of three
distinct HI concentrations embedded in an extended envelope of diffuse HI
discovered in earlier Arecibo studies of the system. The HI masses of the three
concentrations do not appear to be sufficient for them to be self-gravitating;
however, their HImasses and dynamical masses are very similar to those of faint
Im galaxies in the Virgo cluster. The peak HI column density of each of the
clouds is close to the star formation threshold, but CCD images in B and R
reveal no trace of stars nor star formation. If the system is gravitationally
bound and in Virial equilibrium, we find its total mass to be ten times that
within the outermost HI contours of the individual galaxies and clouds.
Thirty-seven percent of the total HI lies outside the boundaries of the
individual galaxies as determined by the VLA mapping; 28% cannot be ascribed to
either galaxy nor to the discrete concentrations. One possible way to account
for the velocity field and the large quantity of diffuse gas is to assume that
DDO 137, the gas concentrations and other apparent tidal features are due to
gas infall into clumps within the dark matter potential of the group, and that
prior to the interaction the group consisted of an irregular galaxy (NGC 4532)
and a large, star-poor HI cloud like HI 1225+01 (Giovanelli et al. 1991).

examined on deep optical plates by Binggeli et al. 1990 and contains loose
groups with many gas-rich galaxies as well as voids. No galaxies that had not
been previously identified in these deep optical surveys were uncovered in our
HI survey, neither in the groups nor the voids. The implication is that no
substantial quantity of neutral hydrogen contained in gas-rich galaxies has
been missed in these well-studied groups. All late-type members of our sample

Abstract:  Determination of the epoch dependent star-formation rate of field galaxies is
one of the principal goals of modern observational cosmology. Recently, Hughes
et al. (1998) using the SCUBA instrument on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope,
report the detection of a new population of heavily dust enshrouded,
star-forming galaxies at high redshifts (z > 2), dramatically altering the
picture of galaxy evolution. However, we show that this interpretation must be
treated with caution because of ambiguities in the identification of the host
galaxies. Based on our deep, high resolution 1.4 GHz obervations of the Hubble
Deep Field, we suggest alternate identifications to the sub-mm detections.
These identifications argue for a substantially lower redshift to the sub-mm
population with a consequential lowering of the z > 2 sub-mm/far infrared
luminosity density and global star-formation rate.

Title:The Evolution of Dust Opacity in Galaxies,"
Abstract:  (Abridged) We investigate the evolution of the opacity of galaxies as a
function of redshift, using simple assumptions about the metal and dust
enrichment of the gas and the distribution of dust in galaxies. We use an
iterative procedure to reconstruct the intrinsic Star Formation Rate (SFR)
density of galaxies with redshift, by applying dust obscuration corrections to
the observed UV emission. The iterative procedure converges to multiple
solutions for the intrinsic SFR density, divided into two basic classes. The
first class of solutions predicts relatively large UV attenuation at high
redshift, with A(1500 A)=1.9 mag at z~3, and smaller attenuations at z<1, with
A(2800 A)=1.25 mag. The SFR density of this set of solutions is constant for
z>~1.2 and declines for z<1.2; it resembles in shape the ``monolithic
collapse'' scenario for star formation. The second class of solutions predicts
relatively low UV attenuations at high redshift, with A(1500 A)=0.75 mag at
z~3, and larger attenuations at z<1, with A(2800 A)=1.50 mag. The SFR density
in this case has a peak at z~1.2. The advantages and shortcomings of both
classes are analyzed in the light of available observational constraints,
including the opacity of galaxies at 0<z<1 and the intensity and spectral
energy distribution of the cosmic infrared background from the COBE DIRBE and
FIRAS data. We conclude that both classes of models are acceptable within the
current uncertainties, but the ``monolithic collapse'' class matches the
available observations better than the other one. We also investigate the
dependence of our solutions on the different model assumptions.

Title:On the Structure and Morphology of the `Diffuse Ionized Medium' in Star-Forming Galaxies,"
Abstract:  Deep H$\alpha$ images of a sample of nearby late-type spiral galaxies have
been analyzed to characterize the morphology and energetic significance of the
``Diffuse Ionized Medium'' (DIM). We find that the DIM properties can be
reasonably unified as a function of relative surface brightness, by using a new
method to quantify the DIM importance in galaxies. This new approach is more
consistent with the fundamentally morphological definition of the DIM as being
`Diffuse', compared to the traditional way adopted in previous studies that
could only isolate the DIM based on an absolute surface brightness criterion.
Our results suggest that the variation of the DIM's significance among the
galaxies is small enough so that the fractional contribution of the DIM to the
global H$\alpha$ luminosity in the galaxies is fairly constant, as has been
observed. We found a smooth structural transition from HII regions to the DIM,
suggesting that the ionizing energy for the DIM mainly comes from HII regions.

individual indices are available. This new determination of effective
temperature has been performed in a homogeneous way for all these stars. As the
effective temperature determination is related to the assumed metallicity, we
explore simultaneous solutions in the (Teff,[Fe/H])-plane and present our
results as confidence regions computed to match the observed values of surface
gravity, b-y, m_1, and c_1, taking into account interstellar reddening. These

Title:On the local radio luminosity function of galaxies. I: the Virgo cluster,"
Abstract:  We cross-correlate the galaxies brighter than mB=18 in the Virgo cluster with
the radio sources in the NVSS survey (1.4 GHz), resulting in 180 radio-optical
identifications. We determine the radio luminosity function of the Virgo
galaxies, separately for the early- and late-types. Late-type galaxies develop
radio sources with a probability proportional to their optical luminosity. In
fact their radio/optical (RB) distribution is gaussian, centered at log
RB=-0.5, i.e. the radio luminosity is 0.3 of the optical one. The probability
of late-type galaxies to develop radio sources is almost independent of their
detailed Hubble type, except for Sa (and S0+S0a) which are a factor of 5 less
frequent than later types at any RB. Giant elliptical galaxies feed ""monster""
radio sources with a probability strongly increasing with mass. However the
frequency of fainter radio sources is progressively less sensitive on the
system mass. The faintest giant E galaxies (MB=-17) have a probability of
feeding low power radio sources similar to that of dwarf E galaxies as faint as
MB=-13.

Title:On the local radio luminosity function of galaxies. II: environmental dependences among late-type galaxies,"
Abstract:  Using new extensive radio continuum surveys at 1.4 GHz (FIRST and NVSS), we
derive the distribution of the radio/optical and radio/NIR luminosity (RLF) of
late-type (Sa-Irr) galaxies (mp<15.7) in 5 nearby clusters of galaxies: A262,
Cancer, A1367, Coma and Virgo. With the aim of discussing possible
environmental dependences of the radio properties, we compare these results
with those obtained for relatively isolated objects in the Coma supercluster.
We find that the RLF of Cancer, A262 and Virgo are consistent with that of
isolated galaxies. Conversely we confirm earlier claims that galaxies in A1367
and Coma have their radio emissivity enhanced by a factor of 5 with respect to
isolated objects. We discuss this result in the framework of the dynamical
pressure suffered by galaxies in motion through the intra-cluster gas
(ram-pressure). We find that the radio excess is statistically larger for
galaxies in fast transit motion. This is coherent with the idea that enhanced
radio continuum activity is associated with magnetic field compression. The
X-ray luminosities and temperatures of Coma and A1367 imply that these two
clusters have significantly larger intracluster gas density than the remaining
three studied ones, providing a clue for explaining the higher radio continuum
luminosities of their galaxies. Multiple systems in the Coma supercluster
bridge (with projected separations smaller than 300 kpc) have radio
luminosities significantly larger than isolated galaxies.

Title:X-ray spectral evolution of GS 2023+338 (V404 Cyg) during decline after outburst,"
Abstract:  We have re-analyzed archival GINGA data of the soft X-ray transient source
GS2023+308 (V404 Cyg) covering the decline phase of its May 1989 outburst. Our
spectral modelling includes the relativistically smeared Compton reflected
continuum and iron K\alpha fluorescent line near 6.5 keV produced by X-ray
illumination of the accretion disc. This gives a powerful diagnostic of the
accretion geometry, with the amplitude of the reprocessed components showing
the solid angle subtended by the disc, while the detailed shape of the
relativistic smearing shows how close this material is to the black hole event
horizon.
We find that reflection is always significantly present in the spectra, but
that its fractional contribution decreases as the decline progresses. The
amount of relativistic smearing is also consistent with decreasing during the
decline, although this is poorly constrained except for the brightest spectra.
One plausible scenario explaining this evolution is of an optically thick disc
with inner radius increasing as a function of time, with the X-ray source in
the form of a central corona. This is similar to the evolution inferred for
other X-ray transient sources, such as Nova Muscae, except that the underlying
power law spectrum of GS 2023+338 stayed constant as the disc geometry changed.
This challenges the underlying assumption of almost all models for the spectra
of accreting black holes, namely that the hard X-rays are formed by
Comptonization of seed photons from the accretion disc.

Title:Topological lens effects in universes with non-Euclidean compact spatial sections,"
Abstract:  Universe models with compact spatial sections smaller than the observable
universe produce a topological lens effect. Given a catalog of cosmic sources,
we estimate the number of topological images in locally hyperbolic and locally
elliptic spaces, as a function of the cosmological parameters, of the volume of
the spatial sections and of the catalog depth. Next we apply the
crystallographic method, aimed to detect a topological signal in the 3D
distance histogram between images, to compact hyperbolic models. Numerical
calculations in the Weeks manifold allows us to check the absence of
crystallographic signature of topology, due to the fact that the number of
copies of the fundamental domain in the observable covering space is low and
that the points are not moved the same distance by the holonomies of space.

Abstract:  We study numerical simulations of satellite galaxy disruption in a potential

quantified using a coarse-grained entropy. Although after 10 billion years few
obvious asymmetries remain in the distribution of particles in configuration
space, strong correlations are still present in velocity space. We briefly
describe how we can understand these effects based on the conservation of
fine-grained phase-space density in an action-angle formalism. We also discuss
the implications of our results on the known properties of the stellar halo.

Title:Results from the CASTLES Survey of Gravitational Lenses,"
Abstract:  We show that most gravitational lenses lie on the passively evolving
fundamental plane for early-type galaxies. For burst star formation models (1
Gyr of star formation, then quiescence) in low Omega_0 cosmologies, the stellar
populations of the lens galaxies must have formed at z_f > 2. Typical lens
galaxies contain modest amounts of patchy extinction, with a median
differential extinction for the optical (radio) selected lenses of E(B-V) =
0.04 (0.07) mag. The dust can be used to determine both extinction laws and
lens redshifts. For example, the z_l=0.96 elliptical lens in MG0414+0534 has an
R_V=1.7 +/- 0.1 mean extinction law. Arc and ring images of the quasar and AGN
source host galaxies are commonly seen in NICMOS H band observations. The hosts
are typically blue, L < L_* galaxies.

Abstract:  We explore subtle variations in disk-integrated measurements spanning
$\lsim$ 18 years of stellar surface magnetism by using a newly developed
time-frequency gapped wavelet algorithm.
We present results based on analysis of the Mount Wilson
Ca II H and K emission fluxes in four, magnetically-active stars (HD 1835
[G2V], 82885 [G8IV-V], 149661 [K0V] and 190007 [K4V]) and sensitivity tests
using artificial data.
When the wavelet basis is appropriately modified (i.e., when the
time-frequency resolution is optimized), the results are consistent with the
existence of spatially localized and long-lived
Ca II features (assumed here as activity regions that tend to recur in
narrowly-confined latitude bands), especially in HD 1835 and 82885.
This interpretation is based on the observed persistence of relatively
localized Ca II wavelet power at a narrow range of rotational time scales,
enduring as long as $\gsim$ 10 years.

Abstract:  We calculate the expected number of multiply-imaged galaxies in the Hubble
Deep Field (HDF), using photometric redshift information for galaxies with m_I
< 27 that were detected in all four HDF passbands. A comparison of these
expectations with the observed number of strongly lensed galaxies constrains
the current value of Omega_m-Omega_Lambda, where Omega_m is the mean mass
density of the universe and Omega_Lambda is the normalized cosmological
constant. Based on current estimates of the HDF luminosity function and
associated uncertainties in individual parameters, our 95% confidence lower
limit on Omega_m-Omega_Lambda ranges between -0.44, if there are no strongly
lensed galaxies in the HDF, and -0.73, if there are two strongly lensed
galaxies in the HDF. If the only lensed galaxy in the HDF is the one presently
viable candidate, then, in a flat universe (Omega_m+Omega_Lambda=1),
Omega_Lambda < 0.79 (95% C.L.). These limits are compatible with estimates
based on high-redshift supernovae and with previous limits based on
gravitational lensing.

Title:Group-cluster merging and the formation of starburst galaxies,"
Abstract:  A significant fraction of clusters of galaxies are observed to have
substructure, which implies that merging between clusters and subclusters is a
rather common physical process of cluster formation.
It still remains unclear how cluster merging affects the evolution of cluster
member galaxies.
We report the results of numerical simulations, which show the dynamical
evolution of a gas-rich late-type spiral in a merger between a small group of
galaxies and a cluster. The simulations demonstrate that time-dependent tidal
gravitational field of the merging excites non-axisymmetric structure of the
galaxy, subsequently drives efficient transfer of gas to the central region,
and finally triggers a secondary starburst.
This result provides not only a new mechanism of starbursts but also a close
physical relationship between the emergence of starburst galaxies and the
formation of substructure in clusters. We accordingly interpret post-starburst
galaxies located near substructure of the Coma cluster as one observational
example indicating the global tidal effects of group-cluster merging.
Our numerical results furthermore suggest a causal link between the observed
excess of blue galaxies in distant clusters and cluster virialization process
through hierarchical merging of subclusters.

Abstract:  Determination of the epoch dependent star-formation rate of field galaxies is
one of the principal goals of modern observational cosmology. Deep radio

a population of optically faint, possibly obscured systems that are candidate

Title:Spatial Corrections of ROSAT HRI Observations,"
Abstract:  X-ray observations with the ROSAT High Resolution Imager (HRI) often have
spatial smearing on the order of 10 arcsec (Morse 1994). This degradation of
the intrinsic resolution of the instrument (5 arcsec) can be attributed to
errors in the aspect solution associated with the wobble of the space craft or
with the reacquisition of the guide stars. We have developed a set of IRAF/PROS
and MIDAS/EXSAS routines to minimize these effects. Our procedure attempts to
isolate aspect errors that are repeated through each cycle of the wobble. The
method assigns a 'wobble phase' to each event based on the 402 second period of
the ROSAT wobble. The observation is grouped into a number of phase bins and a
centroid is calculated for each sub-image. The corrected HRI event list is
reconstructed by adding the sub-images which have been shifted to a common
source position. This method has shown approx. 30% reduction of the full width
half maximum (FWHM) of an X-ray observation of the radio galaxy 3C 120.

Abstract:  We present deep HST F555W (V) and F814W (I) observations of a central field
in the Local Group dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy Leo I. The resulting
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) reaches I \simeq 26 and reveals the oldest ~10-15
Gyr old turnoffs. Nevertheless, a horizontal branch is not obvious in the CMD.
Given the low metallicity of the galaxy, this likely indicates that the first
substantial star formation in the galaxy may have been somehow delayed in Leo I
in comparison with the other dSph satellites of the Milky Way. The subgiant
region is well and uniformly populated from the oldest turnoffs up to the 1 Gyr
old turnoff, indicating that star formation has proceeded in a continuous way,
with possible variations in intensity but no big gaps between successive
bursts, over the galaxy's lifetime. The structure of the red-clump of core
He-burning stars is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age
population inferred from the main sequence and the subgiant region. In spite of
the lack of gas in Leo I, the CMD clearly shows star formation continuing until
1 Gyr ago and possibly until a few hundred Myrs ago in the central part of the
galaxy.

Title:Direct Signature of Evolving Gravitational Potential from Cosmic Microwave Background,"
Abstract:  We show that time dependent gravitational potential can be directly detected
from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. The signature can be
measured by cross-correlating the CMB with the projected density field
reconstructed from the weak lensing distortions of the CMB itself. The
cross-correlation gives a signal whenever there is a time dependent
gravitational potential. This method traces dark matter directly and has a well
defined redshift distribution of the window projecting over the density
perturbations, thereby avoiding the problems plaguing other proposed
cross-correlations. We show that both MAP and Planck will be able to probe this
effect for observationally relevant curvature and cosmological constant models,
which will provide additional constraints on the cosmological parameters.

Title:Stellar populations in gas-rich galaxy mergers II. Feedback effects of Type Ia and II supernovae,"
Abstract:  We numerically investigate chemodynamical evolution of major disk-disk galaxy
mergers in order to explore the origin of mass-dependent chemical, photometric,
and spectroscopic properties observed in elliptical galaxies. We particularly
investigate the dependence of the fundamental properties on merger progenitor
disk mass (M_d). Main results obtained in this study are the following three.
(1) More massive (luminous) ellipticals formed by galaxy mergers between more
massive spirals have larger metallicity (Z) and thus show redder colors: The
typical metallicity ranges from ~ 1.0 solar abundance (Z~ 0.02) for ellipticals
formed by mergers with M_d = 10^10 M_solar to ~ 2.0 solar (Z ~ 0.04) for those
with M_d = 10^12 M_solar. (2) The absolute magnitude of negative metallicity
gradients developed in galaxy mergers is more likely to be larger for massive
ellipticals.
Absolute magnitude of metallicity gradient correlates with that of age
gradient in ellipticals in the sense that an elliptical with steeper negative
metallicity gradient is more likely to show steeper age gradient. (3) Both
M/L_B and M/L_K, where M, L_B, and L_K are total stellar mass of galaxy
mergers, B-band luminosity, and K-band one, respectively, depend on galactic
mass in such a way that more massive ellipticals have larger M/L_B and smaller
M/L_K.

Abstract:  The metal deficient (Z = Z_sun/41) Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxy (BCD) SBS
0335-052 was observed with ISOCAM between 5 and 17 mic. With a L_12mic/L_B
ratio of 2.15, the galaxy is unexpectedly bright in the mid-infrared for such a
low-metallicity object. The mid-infrared spectrum shows no sign of the
Unidentified Infrared Bands, which we interpret as an effect of the destruction
of their carriers by the very high UV energy density in SBS 0335-052. The
spectral energy distribution (SED) is dominated by a very strong continuum
which makes the ionic lines of [SIV] and [NeIII] very weak. From 5 to 17 mic,
the SED can be fitted with a grey-body spectrum, modified by an extinction law
similar to that observed toward the Galactic Center, with an optical depth of
A_V~19-21 mag. Such a large optical depth implies that a large fraction (as
much as ~ 75%) of the current star-formation activity in SBS 0335-052 is hidden
by dust with a mass between 3x10^3 M_sun and 5x10^5 M_sun. Silicate grains are
present as silicate extinction bands at 9.7 and 18 mic can account for the
unusual shape of the MIR spectrum of SBS 0335-052. It is remarkable that such a
nearly primordial environment contains as much dust as galaxies which are 10
times more metal-rich. If the hidden star formation in SBS 0335-052 is typical
of young galaxies at high redshifts, then the cosmic star formation rate
derived from UV/optical fluxes would be underestimated.

Title:On the Survival and Destruction of Spiral Galaxies in Clusters,"
Abstract:  We follow the evolution of disk galaxies within a cluster that forms
hierarchically in a cold dark matter N-body simulation. At a redshift z=0.5 we
select several dark matter halos that have quiet merger histories and are about
to enter the newly forming cluster environment. The halos are replaced with
equilibrium high resolution model spirals that are constructed to represent
examples of low surface brightness (LSB) and high surface brightness (HSB)
galaxies. Varying the disk and halo structural parameters reveals that the
response of a spiral galaxy to tidal encounters depends primarily on the
potential depth of the mass distribution and the disk scale length. LSB
galaxies, characterised by slowly rising rotation curves and large scale
lengths, evolve dramatically under the influence of rapid encounters with
substructure and strong tidal shocks from the global cluster potential ---
galaxy harassment. We find that up to 90% of their stars are tidally stripped
and congregate in large diffuse tails that trace the orbital path of the galaxy
and form the diffuse intra-cluster light. The bound stellar remnants closely
resemble the dwarf spheroidals (dE's) that populate nearby clusters. HSB
galaxies are stable to the chaos of cluster formation and tidal encounters.
These disks lie well within the tidally limited dark matter halos and their
potentials are more concentrated. Although very few stars are stripped, the
scale height of the disks increases substantially and no spiral features
remain, therefore we speculate that these galaxies would be identified as S0
galaxies in present day clusters.

Abstract:  We investigate the influence of convective overshoot on stellar evolution
models of the thermal pulse AGB phase with M_ZAMS = 3 Msol. An exponential
diffusive overshoot algorithm is applied to all convective boundaries during
all evolutionary stages. We demonstrate that overshooting at the bottom of the
pulse-driven convective zone, which forms in the intershell during the He-shell
flash, leads to more efficient third dredge-up. Some overshoot at the bottom of
the convective envelope removes the He-H discontinuity, which would otherwise
prohibit the occurrence of the third dredge-up for this stellar mass. However,
no correlation between the amount of envelope overshoot and the efficiency of
the third dredge-up has been found. Increasingly efficient third dredge-up
eventually leads to a carbon star model. Due to the partial mixing efficiency
in the overshoot region a C13-pocket can form after the third dredge-up event
which may be crucial for n-capture nucleosynthesis.

the centre, where gas is theoretically expected to pile up. Using the Swedish
ESO Submm Telescope, we detected both 12CO(1-0) and (2-1) line emission towards
the central position. The line ratio and the line widths suggest that the
CO(2--1) emission is sub-thermal and that the CO(1-0) emission arises within
the central 22'' (13 kpc); it is probably associated with the inner ring and
nucleus. We infer a mass of molecular gas (H2) of 1.5 to 6 10^9 M_sol, which is
significantly higher than the approx. 10^8 M_sol of atomic gas within that
region. The low excitation of the gas, whether it is due to a low temperature
or a low density, is consistent with the weak star-forming activity observed in
the centre of the Cartwheel.

Title:Carbon stars in populations of different metallicity,"
Abstract:  Our current knowledge of carbon stars in the Local Group and beyond, is
discussed. Although many carbon stars and late M-stars have been identified in
external galaxies a coherent understanding in terms of the chemical evolution-
and star formation rate-history of a galaxy is still largely lacking. Issues
that need to be addressed are: 1) for some of the larger galaxies only a small
fraction in area has been surveyed so far, 2) surveys have been conducted using
different techniques, and may be incomplete in bolometric magnitude, 3) only
for some galaxies is there information about the late M-star population, 4) not
all galaxies in the Local Group have been surveyed, 5) only for a sub-set of
stars are bolometric magnitudes available.
From the existing observations one can derive the following: the formation of
carbon stars is both a function of metallicity and star-formation. In galaxies
with a similar star-formation rate history, there will be relatively more

Title:Time-scale for accretion of matter,"
Abstract:  Mass accretion is the key factor for evolution of galaxies. It can occur
through secular evolution, when gas in the outer parts is driven inwards by
dynamical instabilities, such as spirals or bars. This secular evolution
proceeds very slowly when spontaneous, and can be accelerated when triggered by
companions. Accretion can also occur directly through merging of small
companions, or more violent interaction and coalescence. We discuss the
relative importance of both processes, their time-scale and frequency along a
Hubble time. Signatures of both processes can be found in the Milky Way. It is
however likely that our Galaxy had already gathered the bulk of its mass about
8-10 Gyr ago, as is expected in hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios.

Title:A Matter Scalar Field in a Closed Universe,"
Abstract:  We investigate the possibility that the matter of the universe has a
significant component (the quintessence component) determined by the equation
of state $p=w\rho$, with $w<0$. Here, we find conditions under which a closed
model may look like a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe at low redshift.
We study this problem in Einstein's general relativity and Brans-Dicke
theories. In both cases we obtain explicit expressions for the quintessence
scalar potential $V(Q)$, and the angular size as a function of the redshift.

Title:Halo Kinematics,"
Abstract:  I summarize recent observations of the kinematics of hot tracers in
elliptical galaxy halos (globular clusters, planetary nebulae, and integrated
stellar light), and what these tell us about the dynamics, dark matter content,
and formation of ellipticals. A generic result is the ubiquity of dark matter
halos in ellipticals. Studies of globular clusters and planetary nebulae are
now finding outer-halo rotation in many ellipticals, with V/sigma ~ 1 beyond a
few R_e. In some giant ellipticals (M49, M87), there are possible kinematic
differences between metal-poor and metal-rich globular clusters. These results
are consistent with a merger origin for ellipticals. High-quality data and new
modelling techniques now make it possible to determine simultaneously the
orbital anisotropy and gravitational potential in ellipticals from
integrated-light measurements; such studies now provide the best evidence for
dark matter halos in ellipticals.The new generation of 8-10m telescopes, with
multi-object and integral-field spectrographs, will dramatically increase
sample sizes of discrete tracers and provide two-dimensional spectroscopy of
elliptical halos. New methods of analysis will allow robust determinations of
stellar kinematics and dark matter distributions in a much larger number of
ellipticals. Comparison with numerical simulations, which are becoming ever
more detailed and physically realistic, will become increasingly important.

Title:Intergalactic H_2 Photodissociation and the Soft UV Background Produced by Population III Objects,"
Abstract:  We study the effects of the ionizing and dissociating photons produced by
PopIII objects on the surrounding intergalactic medium. We find that the
typical size of a H_2 photodissociated region, R_d ~ 1-5 kpc, is smaller than
the mean distance between sources at z ~ 20-30, but larger than the ionized
region by a factor depending on the detailed properties of the emission
spectrum. This implies that clearing of intergalactic H_2 occurs before
reionization of the universe is complete. In the same redshift range, the
soft-UV background in the Lyman-Werner bands, when the intergalactic H and H_2
opacity is included, is found to be J_LW ~ 1d-30 - 1d-27 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}
Hz^{-1}. This value is well below the threshold required for the negative
feedback of PopIII objects on the subsequent galaxy formation to be effective
in that redshift range.

Title:Cataclysmic Variables and a Candidate Helium White Dwarf in the Globular Cluster NGC 6397,"
Abstract:  We have used HST/FOS to study faint UV stars in the core of the nearby
globular cluster NGC 6397. We confirm the presence of a 4th cataclysmic
variable (CV) in NGC 6397 (CV 4), and we use the photometry of Cool et al.
(1998) to present evidence that CVs 1--4 all have faint disks and probably low
accretion rates. By combining these results with new UV spectra of CV 1 and the
published spectra of Grindlay et al. (1995) we present new evidence that CVs
1--3 may be DQ Her systems, and we show that CV 4 may either be a dwarf nova or
another magnetic system. Another possibility is that the CVs could be old novae
in hibernation between nova eruptions. We also present the first spectrum of a
member of a new class of UV bright stars in NGC 6397. These faint, hot stars do
not vary, unlike the CVs, and are thus denoted as ``non-flickerers'' (NFs).
Like the CVs, their spatial concentration is strongly concentrated toward the
cluster center. Using stellar atmosphere models we have determined log g =
6.25, and T_eff = 17,500 K for this NF. Using these line parameters and the
luminosity of the NF we show that the NF spectrum is consistent with a helium
WD having a mass of ~0.25 solar masses and an age between 0.1 and 0.5 Gyr
(depending on the models used). The NF spectrum appears to be significantly
Doppler shifted from the expected wavelength, suggesting the presence of a
dark, massive companion, probably a carbon-oxygen WD.

Abstract:  The ROSAT Bright Survey (RBS) aims to completely optically identify the more
than 2000 brightest sources detected in the ROSAT all-sky survey at galactic
latitudes |b| > 30 degr (excluding LMC, SMC, Virgo cluster). This paper
presents a subsample of 66 bright point-like ROSAT survey sources with almost
hard PSPC spectra, the hardness ratio HR1 is > 0.5 for most of the sources. The
subsample could be nearly completely identified by low-resolution optical
spectroscopy with the following breakdown into object classes: 31 Seyfert
galaxies, 22 BL Lac candidates, 5 clusters of galaxies 1 cataclysmic variable,
and 5 bright stars. Only one object remained unidentified and one X-ray source
was a spurious detect ion. The redshift distribution peaks around 0.06 for the
Seyferts and around 0.13 for the BL Lac candidates. Observations with medium
spectral resolution were obtained for most of the new S eyfert galaxies. A
large fraction (20 objects) are type 1 Seyfert galaxies, the other fraction
includes Seyfert galaxies of type 1.5 - 1.8 (5 objects), two LINERs, and 4
possible narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1). About one third of the new
Seyfert's have nearby companion galaxies displaying either emission or
absorption lines at the same redshift. Among them are a couple of systems
showing direct morphological evidence for interaction. The large fraction of
interacting galaxies among our sample suggests a scenario where interaction is
the main trigger of AGN activity.

additional numerical calculations, the model allows the prediction of

the companion star, the horizontal stream and the accretion curtain are
identified with the emission line components found by Gaussian fitting to
observational data of HU Aqr in its high accretion state. Given the simplicity

Title:Necessity for High Accuracy Rotation Curves in Spiral Galaxies,"
Abstract:  In the last 20 years, rotation curves derived from H I kinematics obtained on
radio synthesis instruments were used to probe the dark matter distribution in
spiral and dwarf irregular galaxies. It is shown, with the aid of the Sd galaxy
NGC 5585, that high resolution 2--D H II kinematics is necessary to determine
accurately the mass distribution of spirals. New CFHT Fabry--Perot Hff
observations are combined with low resolution Westerbork H I data to study its
mass distribution. Using the combined rotation curve and best fit models, it
can be seen that the (M/LB) of the luminous disk goes from 0.3, using only the
H I rotation curve, to 0.8, using both the optical and the radio data. This
reduces the dark--to--luminous mass ratio by 30%.

Abstract:  Deep radio observations at 5 and 8 GHz are presented of a complete sample of
11 radio galaxies with redshifts 0.85 < z < 1.5, selected from the 6C sample of
Eales. The radio data, taken using the VLA in A, B and C array configurations,
provide a best angular resolution of 0.25'' and reach an rms noise level of
order 20 microJy. Radio core candidates are detected in 8 of the 11 sources. 9
of the 11 sources display deviations from `standard double radio source'
morphologies, with multiple hotspots or a hotspot withdrawn from the leading
edge of the radio emission. The sources are typically polarised at the 5 to 15%
level. The mean rotation measures of the individual lobes are less than 50
rad/m^2 but strong asymmetries between the two lobes indicate that the Faraday
rotation does not have a Milky Way origin; rather, the distant 6C radio sources
lie in a relatively dense clumpy environment. The sources are compared with the
more radio powerful distant 3CR radio galaxies and with low redshift sources.
The ratio of core to extended radio flux is almost independent of the radio
source size and only weakly inversely correlated with the total radio power.
This indicates that the high radio luminosity of the most powerful radio
sources must originate in the AGN, in contrast to the suggestion that they are
so luminous only due to confinement by a dense surrounding environment.
Environmental effects play a secondary role. (Abridged)

Title:Observational Constraints on Microwave Anisotropy from Point Sources,"
Abstract:  Applying basic physical principles to recent observational results, we derive
upper and lower limits on microwave anisotropy from point sources over the
range of frequencies 10-1000 GHz. We examine the level of noise in the
observations as a possible indication of source confusion at subarcminute
scales. We also derive an upper limit on microwave anisotropy caused by the
sources responsible for the Far-Infrared Background radiation detected in FIRAS
data. Our upper limit on point source confusion of DeltaT/T=10^{-5} for a 10'
beam at 100 GHz would cause severe foreground contamination for CMB anisotropy
observations, although the actual contamination level is probably much lower.
This upper limit constrains the long-feared possibility of an undetected
population of sources with emission peaking near 100 GHz. Source detections
closer to 100 GHz are needed to improve our knowledge of galaxy evolution at
high redshift and to predict the level of point source confusion.

Title:The ESO Slice Project (ESP) galaxy redshift survey: VI Groups of Galaxies,"
Abstract:  In this paper we identify objectively and analyze groups of galaxies in the
recently completed ESP survey. We find 231 groups above the number overdensity
threshold delta(rho)/rho=80 in the redshift range 5000<cz <60000 km/s. These
groups contain 1250 members, 40.5% of the 3085 ESP galaxies within the same
redshift range. The median velocity dispersion (corrected for measurement
errors and computed at the redshift of the group) is sigma_{ESP,median} = 194
km/s. We show that our result is reliable in spite of the particular geometry
of the ESP survey (two rows of tangent circular fields of radius 15 arcmin),
which causes most systems to be only partially surveyed. In general, we find
that the properties of ESP groups are consistent with those of groups in
shallower (and wider) catalogs (e.g. CfA2N and SSRS2). As in shallower
catalogs, ESP groups trace very well the geometry of the large scale structure.
Our results are of particular interest because the depth of the ESP survey
allows us to sample group properties over a large number of structures. We also
compare luminosity function and spectral properties of galaxies that are
members of groups with those of isolated galaxies. We find that galaxies in
groups have a brighter M* with respect to non--member galaxies; the slope
\alpha is the same, within the errors, in the two cases. We find that 34% of
ESP galaxies with detectable emission lines are members of groups. The fraction
of galaxies without detectable emission lines in groups is significantly
higher: 45%. More generally, we find a gradual decrease of the fraction of
emission line galaxies among members of systems of increasing richness. This
result confirms that the morphology-density relation found for clusters also
extends toward systems of lower density.

Title:A Model for the Outer Rings of SN 1987A,"
Abstract:  I propose a model for the formation of the two outer rings of SN 1987A. The
main new ingredient is a short-lived, few times 10 years, intermediate wind, of
velocity of about 100 km/s and total mass of about 10^{-3} Mo - few times
10^{-2} Mo\odot which is concentrated near the equatorial plane. This
intermediate wind was formed during the few orbital periods when a binary
companion entered the envelope of the progenitor of SN 1987a, when the latter
was a red supergiant. The intermediate wind formed a hollowed torus with a
horseshoe-shaped cross section. The inner regions at the ends of the horseshoe
torus are the two outer rings of SN 1987A. The other regions of the torus were
cleaned by the fast wind blown after the progenitor turns into a blue giant.
The proposed scenario accounts for: (i) slow motion of the outer rings; (ii)
the high density contrast of the outer rings to their surroundings; (iii) the
presence of only two outer rings; (iv) the displacement of the rings relative
to the central star; (v) the fact that no planetary nebulae have been observed
to have a single pair of outer rings.

Abstract:  We consider the problem of the initial conditions and behaviour of the

We use the general definition of adiabatic and isocurvature conditions to set
the appropriate initial values for the perturbation in the scalar field and in
the ordinary matter and radiation components. In both the cases of initial
adiabaticity and isocurvature, we solve the Einstein and fluid equation at
early times and on superhorizon scales to find the initial behaviour of the
relevant quantities. In particular, in the isocurvature case, we consider
models in which the initial perturbation arises from the matter as well as from
the scalar field itself, provided that the initial value of the gauge invariant
curvature is zero.
We extend the standard code to include all these cases, and we show some
results concerning the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background
temperature and polarization anisotropies. In particular, it turns out that the
acoustic peaks follow opposite behaviours in the adiabatic and isocurvature
regimes: in the first case their amplitude is higher than in the corresponding
pure cold dark matter model, while they make the opposite thing for pure
isocurvature initial perturbations.

Abstract:  The power spectrum of temperature anisotropies induced by hot intracluster

The shape of the radiation power spectrum is almost independent of the average
intracluster gas density profile, gas evolution history or clusters virial
radii; but the amplitude depends strongly on those parameters and could be as
large as 20% that of intrinsic contribution. The exact value depends on the
global properties of the cluster population and the evolution of the
intracluster gas. The distortion on the Cosmic Microwave Background black body
spectra varies in a similar manner. The ratio of the temperature anisotropy to
the mean Comptonization parameters is shown to be almost independent of the
cluster model and, in first approximation, depends only on the number density
of clusters.

When applying the model to the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548, we are able to

limits on the column density at a distance of 10 ld, of N_{col}(r=10)>10^{22}

information about jet structure is provided by the spectral energy
distributions from radio to gamma-rays, their trends with luminosity, and

Abstract:  We investigate how much warm (T \sim 10^6 K) gas may exist in a Local Group
corona, and, in particular, whether such a corona could be detected indirectly
through its ionizing radiation. We calculate the non-LTE cooling of warm,
low-density gas and the resulting ionizing photon emissivities for a range of
metallicities. In principle a corona can produce a photon flux which
significantly exceeds the cosmic ionizing background. However, the additional
constraints which can be imposed on intragroup gas rule out models which
produce detectable ionizing photon fluxes at the Milky Way's distance from the
Local Group barycenter.

Title:B2045+265: A New Four-Image Gravitational Lens from CLASS,"
Abstract:  We have discovered a new gravitational lens in the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey
(CLASS). B2045+265 is a four-image system with a maximum separation of 1.9
arcsec. A fifth radio component is detected, but its radio spectrum and its
positional coincidence with infrared emission from the lensing galaxy strongly
suggests that it is the radio core of the lensing galaxy. This implies that the
B2045+265 system consists of a flat-spectrum radio source being lensed by
another flat-spectrum radio source. Infrared images detect the lensed images of
the background source and the lensing galaxy. The lensed images have relative
positions and flux densities that are consistent with those seen at radio
wavelengths. Spectra of the system reveal a lens redshift of z_l=0.8673 and a
source redshift of z_s=1.28. The image splitting and system redshifts imply
that the projected mass inside the Einstein radius of the lensing galaxy is
M_E=4.7x10^{11} h^{-1} M_sun. An estimate of the light emitted inside the
Einstein radius gives a mass-to-light ratio in the rest frame B band of
(M/L_B)_E = 20 h (M/L_B)_sun. Both the mass and mass-to-light ratio are higher
than what is seen in nearby Sa galaxies. In fact, the implied rotation velocity
for the lensing galaxy is two to three times higher than what is seen in nearby
spirals. The large projected mass inside the Einstein ring radius may be the
result of a significant amount of dark matter in the system, perhaps from a
compact group of galaxies; however, it may also arise from a misidentification
of the source redshift. A simple model of the gravitational potential of the
lens reproduces the image positions well, but further modeling is required to
satisfy the constraints from the image flux density ratios. With further
observations and modeling, this lens may yield an estimate of H_0.

Title:Weak Lensing: Prospects for Measuring Cosmological Parameters,"
Abstract:  Weak lensing of galaxies by large scale structure can potentially measure
cosmological quantities as accurately as the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
However, the relation between observables and fundamental parameters is more
complex and degenerate, especially in the full space of adiabatic cold dark
matter models considered here. We introduce a Fisher matrix analysis of the
information contained in weak lensing surveys to address these issues and
provide a simple means of estimating how survey properties and source redshift
uncertainties affect parameter measurement. We find that surveys on degree
scales and above can improve the accuracy on parameters that affect the growth
rate of structure by up to an order of magnitude compared to using the CMB
alone even if the characteristic redshift of the sources must be determined
from the data itself. Surprisingly, both sparse sampling and increasing the
source redshift can weaken the cosmological constraints.

Title:Morphology and dynamics of high z radio galaxies and quasars,"
Abstract:  The continuum morphologies of high redshift radio galaxies and quasars can be
modeled as enormous bipolar reflection nebulae from shells of dust swept up by
bipolar outflows. If the observed shape of a particular object is fit with an
analytic function, then the velocity of the shell is specified by the equations
of motion. The predicted kinematics can be compared with the observed emission
line velocity field, and the resulting fit is excellent. The implications for
massive galaxies at high redshift include the requirement of an initial epoch
of star formation that creates dust distributed throughout a very large,
diffuse, nearly virialized halo.

Title:Global Law for Dust-to-gas Ratio of Spiral Galaxies,"
Abstract:  Using a one-zone model for the evolution of dust in spiral galaxies and
applying the instantaneous recycling approximation to the model equations, we
investigate dust-to-gas ratio of spiral galaxies. Four processes are
considered; dust formation from heavy elements ejected by stellar mass loss,
dust destruction in supernova remnants, dust destruction in star-forming
regions, and accretion of heavy elements onto preexisting dust grains. The
equations describe a simplified relation between dust-to-gas ratio and
metallicity. The relation is independent of star formation rate. By comparing
the theoretical relation with the observational data of nearby spiral galaxies,
we show (i) that the accretion process onto the preexisting dust particles must
be taken into account for the spiral galaxies; (ii) that the efficiency of dust
production from heavy elements ejected by stars can be constrained by the
spiral galaxies with low metallicity; (iii) that the Salpeter and Scalo initial
mass functions are both consistent with the data of the spiral galaxies.

Title:Ultraluminous IRAS galaxy 10026+4347,"
Abstract:  We study optical and X-ray properties of the ultraluminous IRAS galaxy
10026+4347. This galaxy is a narrow-line QSO with very strong FeII emission.
Three optical spectra were taken over two years. The full widths at half
maximum (FWHMs) of the emission lines are constant whereas the third spectrum
seems to show a continuum change. Intermediate-band photometry also shows a
small (0.1 mag) but significant decrease in flux. HST WFPC2 images suggest that
this object is a post-merger galaxy. The source is X-ray luminous (L_x ~ 10^45
erg/s) with a very soft X-ray spectrum (photon index ~ 3.2) The X-ray
luminosity exhibits variabilities of a factor of ~8 over four years and a
factor of two within two days. During these X-ray flux changes, the X-ray
spectral shapes are consistent with no variation. All the optical and X-ray
properties resemble those of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, except that the
FWHM of Hbeta is about 2500 km/s, larger than that for most NLS1s. We discuss
the implications of our results on models of NLS1s.

Title:Are Neutrino Oscillations Compatible with the Decaying Neutrino Theory for the Ionisation of Hydrogen in the Interstellar Medium?,"
Abstract:  Recent Super-Kamiokande data have greatly strengthened the hypothesis that
the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is mainly due to nearly maximal oscillations
between $\nu_{\mu}$ and either $\nu_{\tau}$ or a sterile neutrino
$\nu^s_{\mu}$.In this letter we point out that the decaying neutrino theory for
the ionisation of hydrogen in the interstellar medium, in conjunction with the
assumption that the cosmological constant $\lambda$ is zero, requires these
oscillations to be between $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu^s_{\mu}$. This requirement can
be tested by forthcoming Super-Kamiokande measurements. A further requirement
can be derived if the solar neutrino deficit is energy dependent and if both it
and the LSND data are also due to neutrino oscillations. In that case the
decaying neutrino theory alone (without any assumption about the value of
$\lambda$) requires both that the atmospheric anomaly is due to
$\nu_{\mu}-\nu^s_{\mu}$ oscillations and that the solar neutrino oscillations
are between $\nu_e$ and a second sterile neutrino $\nu^s_e$. This latter
requirement can be tested by forthcoming SNO and BOREXINO measurements. If
these are also $\nu_{\tau}-\nu^s_{\tau}$ oscillations the decay line would be
split into two lines of nearly equal intensity and spacing less than $\sim$ 0.2
eV.

Title:A Deep Optical Luminosity Function of NGC 6712 with the VLT: Evidence for Severe Tidal Disruption,"
Abstract:  The VLT on Cerro Paranal was used to observe four fields located at 2.3' from
the center of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6712 in the V and R bands. The
resulting color-magnitude diagram shows a well defined main sequence reaching
down to the 5 sigma detection limit at V~25, R~23.5 or approximately 4 mag
below the main sequence turn-off, the deepest obtained so far on this cluster.
This yields a main sequence luminosity function that peaks at M_R~4.5 and drops
down to the 50% completeness limit at M_R~8.5. Transformation to a mass
function via the latest mass-luminosity relation appropriate to this object
indicates that the peak of the luminosity function corresponds to ~0.75 Msolar,
a value significantly higher than the ~0.25 Msolar measured for most other
clusters observed so far. Since this object, in its Galactic orbit, penetrates
very deeply into the Galactic bulge with perigalactic distance of ~0.3 kpc,
this result is the first strong evidence that tidal forces have stripped this
cluster of a substantial portion of its lower mass star population all the way
down to its half-light radius and possibly beyond.

Title:Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies from Scaling Seeds: Global Defect Models,"
Abstract:  We investigate the global texture model of structure formation in cosmogonies
with non-zero cosmological constant for different values of the Hubble
parameter. We find that the absence of significant acoustic peaks and little
power on large scales are robust predictions of these models. However, from a
careful comparison with data we conclude that at present we cannot safely
reject the model on the grounds of present CMB data. Exclusion by means of
galaxy correlation data requires assumptions on biasing and statistics. New,
very stringent constraints come from peculiar velocities.
Investigating the large-N limit, we argue that our main conclusions apply to
all global O(N) models of structure formation.

Title:Cosmic microwave background: polarization and temperature anisotropies from symmetric structures,"
Abstract:  I consider the case of anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
from one single ordered perturbation source, or seed, existing well before
decoupling between matter and radiation. Such structures could have been left
by high energy symmetries breaking in the early universe.
I focus on the cases of spherical and cylindrical symmetry of the seed. I
give general analytic expressions for the polarization and temperature linear
perturbations, factoring out of the Fourier integral the dependence on the
photon propagation direction and on the geometric coordinates describing the
seed. I show how the CMB perturbations manifestly reflect the symmetries of
their seeds. CMB anisotropies are obtained with a line of sight integration.
This treatment highlights the undulatory properties of the CMB. I show with
numerical examples how the polarization and temperature perturbations propagate
beyond the size of their seeds, reaching the CMB sound horizon at the time
considered. Just like the waves from a pebble thrown in a pond, CMB anisotropy
from a seed intersecting the last scattering surface appears as a series of
temperature and polarization waves surrounding the seed, extending on the scale
of the CMB sound horizon at decoupling, roughly $1^{o}$ in the sky. Each wave
is characterized by its own value of the CMB perturbation, with the same mean
amplitude of the signal coming from the seed interior.
These waves could allow to distinguish relics from high energy processes of
the early universe from point-like astrophysical sources, because of their
angular extension and amplitude. Also, the marked analogy between polarization
and temperature signals offers cross correlation possibilities for the future
Planck Surveyor observations.

Title:Metal abundances and excitation of extranuclear clouds in the Circinus galaxy -- A new method for deriving abundances of AGN narrow line clouds,"
Abstract:  Spectra of extranuclear clouds within the ionization cone of Circinus galaxy
are presented and modelled assuming photoionization by the Seyfert 2 nucleus
but no preconceived assumption concerning the spectral shape of the ionizing
AGN radiation or the gas density distribution.
The most important result is that, regardless of the assumed AGN spectral
shape or density distribution, the metal abundances are remarkably well (+/-0.2
dex) constrained by the data. Oxygen and neon are found to be a factor of 5
below solar, while nitrogen is solar. The large N/O overabundance is in
agreement with the chemical enrichment expected from the old (circum)nuclear
starburst. Similar studies of extranuclear clouds in other objects could
therefore provide a powerful tool to determine metallicities and trace past
starburst activity in AGNs.
Other implications such as the role of shock excitation, which is effectively
excluded, and the intrinsic shape of the AGN ionizing continuum, which is
poorly constrained by the data, are also discussed.

Title:The photometric behaviour of the peculiar PG1159 star HS2324+3944 at high frequency resolution,"
Abstract:  We present the results from 135 hours of nearly continuous time series
photometry on the ``hybrid'' (H-rich) PG1159 variable star HS2324+3944,
obtained in August-September 1997. The power spectrum of the data shows several
frequencies (about 20 or more), concentrated in three narrow and very crowded
regions near 475, 390 and 950 microHz in decreasing amplitude order. Most (if
not all) of the peaks in the latter region are linear combinations of the
high-amplitude frequencies between 455 and 500 microHz. If we divide the data
set into two equal parts, the power spectra are different. This is probably due
to a not sufficiently long (and therefore not completely resolved) light curve;
nevertheless an alternative hypothesis of a single damped oscillator may not be
completely ruled out. If we adopt the first hypothesis, the high concentration
of peaks between 455 and 500 microHz suggests the presence of both l=1 and l=2
high-overtone nonradial g-modes. The insufficient frequency resolution of our
data does not allow to obtain definite precision asteroseismology results.
Nevertheless a spacing of the signals is observed, probably due to stellar
rotation with a period of 2.3 days. If the signal spacing was due to the
successive overtones, the period spacings would be equal to 18.8 (l=1) and 10.4
(l=2) s.

Title:A calibration of the mixing-length for solar-type stars based on hydrodynamical simulations - I. Methodical aspects and results for solar metallicity,"
Abstract:  Based on detailed 2D numerical radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) calculations of
time-dependent compressible convection, we have studied the dynamics and
thermal structure of the convective surface layers of solar-type stars. The RHD
models provide information about the convective efficiency in the
superadiabatic region at the top of convective envelopes and predict the
asymptotic value of the entropy of the deep, adiabatically stratified layers.
This information is translated into an effective mixing-length parameter alpha
suitable to construct standard stellar structure models. We validate the
approach by a detailed comparison to helioseismic data.
The grid of RHD models for solar metallicity comprises 58 simulation runs
with a helium abundance of Y=0.28 in the range of effective temperatures 4300K
< Teff < 7100K and gravities 2.54 < logg < 4.74. We find a moderate,
nevertheless significant variation of alpha between about 1.3 for F-dwarfs and
1.75 for K-subgiants with a dominant dependence on Teff. In the close
neighbourhood of the Sun we find a plateau where alpha remains almost constant.
The internal accuracy of the calibration of alpha is estimated to be +/- 0.05
with a possible systematic bias towards lower values. An analogous calibration
of the convection theory of Canuto & Mazzitelli gives a different temperature
dependence but a similar variation of the free parameter.
For the first time, values for the gravity-darkening exponent beta are
derived independently of mixing-length theory: beta=0.07...0.10.
We show that our findings are consistent with constraints from stellar
stability considerations and provide compact fitting formulae for the
calibrations.

can fit all ground-based and HST data simultaneously, but only when a central
BH is included. Models without BH are ruled out at better than 99.73%
confidence level. We determine a BH mass of $3.0^{+1.7}_{-1.0} \times 10^8
M_\odot$. This corresponds to 2.6% of the bulge mass, making NGC 4342 one of
the galaxies with the highest BH mass to bulge mass ratio currently known.

Follow-up spectroscopy of RASS AGN candidates identified in selected areas of

Abstract:  We review the Galactic chemical evolution of Li6 and compare these results

particular, we concentrate on so-called standard Galactic cosmic-ray
nucleosynthesis in which Li, Be, and B are produced (predominantly) by the
inelastic scattering of accelerated protons and \alpha's off of CNO nuclei in
the ambient interstellar medium. If O/Fe is constant at low metallicities, then
the Li6 vs Fe/H evolution-as well as Be and B vs Fe/H-has difficulty in
matching the observations. However, recent determinations of Population II
oxygen abundances, as measured via OH lines, indicate that O/Fe increases at
lower metallicity; if this trend is confirmed, then the Li6 evolution in a
standard model of cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis is consistent with the data. We
also show that another key indicator of Li6BeB origin is the Li6/Be ratio which
also fits the available data if O/Fe is not constant at low metallicity.
Finally we note that Li6 evolution in this scenario can strongly constrain the
degree to which Li6 and Li7 are depleted in halo stars.

Abstract:  We consider the long-standing problem of predicting the hierarchical
clustering amplitudes $S_p$ in the strongly non-linear regime of gravitational
evolution. N-body results for the non-linear evolution of the bispectrum (the
Fourier transform of the three-point density correlation function) suggest a
physically motivated ansatz that yields the strongly non-linear behavior of the
skewness, $S_3$, starting from leading-order perturbation theory. When
generalized to higher-order ($p>3$) polyspectra or correlation functions, this
ansatz leads to a good description of non-linear amplitudes in the strongly
non-linear regime for both scale-free and cold dark matter models. Furthermore,
these results allow us to provide a general fitting formula for the non-linear
evolution of the bispectrum that interpolates between the weakly and strongly
non-linear regimes, analogous to previous expressions for the power spectrum.

Abstract:  There is abundant evidence that the mass of the Universe is dominated by dark
matter of unknown form. The MACHO project is one of several teams searching for
the dark matter around our Galaxy in the form of Massive Compact Halo Objects
(MACHOs). If a compact object passes very close to the line of sight to a
background star, the gravitational deflection of light causes an apparent
brightening of the star, i.e. a gravitational `microlensing' event. Such events
will be very rare, so millions of stars must be monitored for many years. We
describe our search for microlensing using a very large CCD camera on the
dedicated 1.27m telescope at Mt. Stromlo, Australia: currently some 14 events
have been discovered towards the Large Magellanic Cloud. The lack of
short-timescale events excludes planetary mass MACHOs as a major contributor to
the dark matter, but the observed long events (durations 1--6 months) suggest
that a major fraction may be in fairly massive objects $\sim 0.5 \Msun$. It is
currently difficult but not impossible to explain these events by other lens
populations; we discuss some prospects for clarifying the nature of the lenses.

Title:Structure and properties of transition fronts in accretion discs,"
Abstract:  We use high-resolution time-dependent numerical simulations of accretion
discs around white dwarfs to study the structure and properties of transition
fronts in the context of the thermal-viscous disc instability model. The
thermal structure of cooling and heating fronts is dominated by radiative
cooling and viscous heating, respectively, except in a very narrow precursor
region in heating fronts where advection and radial transport of energy
dominate. Cooling fronts are much broader than heating fronts, but the widths
of both types of fronts scale with the local vertical scale height of the disc.
We confirm that during a fair fraction of the propagation time of a cooling
front, the structure of the inner disc is close to self-similar. The speed of
heating fronts is ~ a few km/s, while the speed of cooling fronts is ~ a
fraction of a km/s. We show that direct measurements of the speed of transition
fronts probably cannot discriminate between various prescriptions proposed for
the viscosity parameter alpha. A natural prediction of the disc instability
model is that fronts decelerate as they propagate in the disc, independent of
the prescription for alpha. Observation of this effect would confirm that dwarf
nova outbursts are driven by the thermal-viscous instability. Most of our
results also apply to low mass X-ray binaries in which the accreting object is
a neutron star or a black hole.

Title:Bayesian photometric redshift estimation,"
Abstract:  Photometric redshift estimation is becoming an increasingly important
technique, although the currently existing methods present several shortcomings
which hinder their application. Here it is shown that most of those drawbacks
are efficiently eliminated when Bayesian probability is consistently applied to
this problem. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization
allows the inclusion of valuable information, e.g. the redshift distributions
or the galaxy type mix, which is often ignored by other methods. In those cases
when the a priori information is insufficient, it is shown how to `calibrate'
the prior distributions, using even the data under consideration. There is an
excellent agreement between the 108 HDF spectroscopic redshifts and the
predictions of the method, with a rms error Delta z/(1+z_spec) = 0.08 up to z<6
and no systematic biases nor outliers. The reliability of the method is further
tested by restricting the color information to the UBVI filters. The results
thus obtained are shown to be more reliable than those of standard techniques
even when the latter include near-IR colors. The Bayesian formalism developed
here can be generalized to deal with a wide range of problems which make use of
photometric redshifts. Several applications are outlined, e.g. the estimation
of individual galaxy characteristics as the metallicity, dust content, etc., or
the study of galaxy evolution and the cosmological parameters from large
multicolor surveys. Finally, using Bayesian probability it is possible to
develop an integrated statistical method for cluster mass reconstruction which
simultaneously considers the information provided by gravitational lensing and
photometric redshifts.

Title:A QSO 2.4 arcsec from a dwarf galaxy - the rest of the story,"
Abstract:  D. Reimers and H.-J. Hagen report in A&A 329, L25 (1998) that a QSO of z =
.807 is a ""by chance projection"" on the center of a galaxy of z = .009. A
considerable amount of previously published evidence would lead us to expect an
active, low redshift galaxy within about one degree of such a quasar. It is
shown here that, in fact, there is a bright Seyfert galaxy of z = .008 only
36.9 arcmin distance. Moreover, it turns out that a total of five quasars, plus
the dwarf galaxy, are accurately aligned along the minor axis of this Seyfert
with the quasars in descending order of redshift, i.e., z = 2.13, 1.97, .81,
.69 and .35.

Title:Single CO Peak in NGC 5850,"
Abstract:  NGC 5850 is a prototype of double-barred galaxy (Friedli et al. 1996)
classified as SBb(sr) I-II (Higdon et al. 1998; Prieto et al. 1997). This kind
of system is primordial to understand the physical mechanism responsible for
feeding galaxy nuclei and boost the star formation rate. The CO(1-0) emission
has been mapped in NGC 5850, i) in the very center, using the IRAM Plateau de
Bure interferometer, to reach a 2.4\arcsec$\times$1.5\arcsec\
(PA$=$$-165^\circ$) spatial resolution, and ii) in the primary bar with the
IRAM-30m telescope, with a 22\arcsec beam. We have found CO emission in the
center of NGC 5850, located in a single peak on the northern part of the
nuclear ring. The high velocity dispersion of the molecular gas may prevent
star formation in that region. Gas simulations performed with a single bar
pattern and without the tidal influence of the companion NGC 5846 are unable to
reproduce the features observed in NGC 5850 (Combes, Leon, Friedli & Buta 1998,
in preparation). The decoupling of a second bar appears necessary. The presence
of the single molecular peak could be due to an $m=1$ mode excited by the
massive companion.

"Title:The Cosmic Infrared Background Radiation, Star Formation Rate, and Metallicity","
Abstract:  The density of the far infrared / submillimeter (FIR/SMM) diffuse
extragalactic radiation field has recently been determined from COBE data.
Nearly simultaneously, deep FIR/SMM surveys have detected substantial numbers
of optically unidentified sources, which have led to the proposal that galaxies
and protogalaxies at red shifts z = 2 to 4 may account for an appreciable
fraction of the background. Here, I show that, if the reported radiation levels
are generated through nucleosynthesis, most of this energy must have been
produced at epochs $z \lesssim 2$. Hubble Deep Field data cited by Madau et al.

have been generated even more recently at $z < 1$.

Title:The Discovery of a Nearby M Dwarf,"
Abstract:  We report the discovery of a nearby M dwarf star, found accidentally while
observing the old nova DN Gem at the Wise Observatory. The star is designated
1200-05296925 in the PMM USNO-A1.0 catalogue and its coordinates, calculated
for 1997 November 27 are: RA=6 55 05.13 Dec = +32 09 54.1 (Equinox J2000, Epoch
J1997.90). Astrometric measurements for the star yielded a yearly proper motion
rate of 0.155$\pm$0.002 arcseconds in right ascension and negligible yearly
proper motion rate in declination. The apparent V magnitude of the star was
measured as m_V=13.87$\pm$0.16 mag and spectral identification yielded a
spectral type of M3.5Ve$\pm$0.5 subclasses. Using relations between spectral
type and absolute V magnitude in M dwarfs, we arrive at an absolute magnitude
of M_V=12.3^{+1.2}_{-1.1} mag, which corresponds to a distance of
21^{+15}_{-10} pc.

Title:The `bare' strange stars might not be bare,"
Abstract:  It is proposed that the `bare' strange matter stars might not be bare, and
radio pulsars might be in fact `bare' strange stars. As strange matter stars
being intensely magnetized rotate, the induced unipolar electric fields would
be large enough to construct magnetospheres. This situation is very similar to
that discussed by many authors for rotating neutron stars. Also, the strange
stars with accretion crusts in binaries could act as X-ray pulsars or X-ray
bursters. There are some advantages if radio pulsars are `bare' strange stars.

momentum. We show that this frequency, for point masses at or close to the
innermost stable orbit, and for holes with moderate to extreme rotation, is
less than, but comparable to the rotation frequency. Thus, if the quasi
periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the modulation of the X-ray flux from
some black holes candidates are due to Lense-Thirring precession of orbiting
material, we predict that a separate, distinct QPO ought to be observed in each

Title:The ESO Nearby Abell Cluster Survey VI. Spatial distribution and kinematics of early- and late-type galaxies,"
Abstract:  We used the galaxy spectra obtained in the ESO Nearby Abell Cluster Survey
(ENACS) to separate early- and late-type galaxies in the ENACS clusters, by
applying a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in combination with an Artificial
Neural Network (ANN). We represented the spectra by 15 Principal Components,
which form the input for the ANN. The latter was trained with morphological
types from Dressler, and its success rate was estimated from an independent
testing set of galaxies. The success-rate for an early- (E+S0) vs. late-type
(Sp+Irr) classification is close to 75 %; somewhat higher for the early-type
galaxies, and somewhat lower for the late-type galaxies. Using the results of
the PCA/ANN analysis ('spectral' galaxy types for 3798 galaxies, 57 % of which
are of early type and 43 % of late type) we constructed a composite cluster of
2594 galaxies. The late-type galaxies appear to have a larger line-of-sight
velocity dispersion and are less centrally concentrated than the early-type
galaxies. The late-type galaxies with emission lines (OII, H-beta, OIII) in
their spectra are mostly responsible for this difference. The properties of the
late-type galaxies without emission lines are more like those of the early-type
galaxies than like those of the late-type galaxies with emission lines. The
interpretation of the large velocity dispersion and the extended distribution,
in terms of fairly radial (possibly 'first-approach') orbits is probably linked
primarily to the presence of emission-line gas and much less to galaxy type.

Abstract:  Deep 6.75um mid-IR ISOCAM observations were obtained of the Canada-France
Redshift Survey (CFRS) 1415+52 field with the Infrared Space Observatory. The
identification of the sources with optical counterparts is described in detail,
and a classification scheme is devised which depends on the S/N of the
detection and the inverse probability of chance coincidence. 83% of the 54
ISOCAM sources are identified with Iab<23.5 counterparts. The (I-K)ab colors,
radio properties, spectrophotometric properties and frequency of nuclear
activity of these counterparts differ on average from those of typical CFRS

the non--stellar counterparts with spectra, 40% are AGNs, and 53% are galaxies
that display star formation activity and/or significant contributions of A

"Title:15um ISO observations of a CFRS field: the cosmic SFR as derived from UV, optical, mid-IR and radio photometry","
Abstract:  The CFRS 1452+52 field has been deeply imaged with the Infrared Space
Observatory (ISO) using ISOCAM through the LW3 filter (12-18um). Careful data
analysis and comparison to deep optical and radio data have allowed us to
generate a catalog of 78 15um sources with both radio and optical
identifications. They are redder and lie at higher redshift than I-band
selected galaxies, with most of them being star-forming galaxies. We have
considered the galaxies detected at radio and 15$\mu$m wavelengths which
potentially include all strong and heavily extincted starbursts, up to z=1.
Spectral energy distributions (SED) for each of the sources have been derived
using deep radio, mid-IR, near-IR, optical and UV photometry. The sources were
then spectrally classified by comparing to SEDs of well known nearby galaxies.
By deriving their FIR luminosities by interpolation, we can estimate their Star
Formation Rate (SFR) in a way which does not depend sensitively on the
extinction. 75% (-40%, +10%) of the star formation at $z \le 1$ is related to
IR emission and the global extinction is in the range Av=0.5 -- 0.85. While
heavily extincted starbursts, with SFR in excess of 100 Mo/yr constitute less
than a percent of all galaxies, they contribute about 18% of the SFR density
out to z=1. Their morphologies range from S0 to Sab, and more than a third are
interacting systems. The SFR derived by FIR fluxes is likely to be ~2.9 times
higher than those previously estimated from UV fluxes. The derived stellar mass
formed since the redshift of 1 could be too high when compared to the present
day stellar mass density. This might be due to an IMF in distant star-forming
galaxies different from the solar neighborhood one, or to an underestimate of
the local stellar mass density.

when combined with measurements of the four other well-observed supernovae with
Cepheid based distances, allow us to calculate the Hubble constant with respect

a Hubble constant of 64.0 +/- 2.2(internal) +/- 3.5(external) km/s/Mpc,
consistent with most previous estimates based on Type Ia supernovae. We note
that the two well-observed Type Ia supernovae in Fornax, if placed at the
Cepheid distance to the possible Fornax spiral NGC 1365, are apparently too
faint with respect to the Calan/Tololo sample calibrated with the five Type Ia

Abstract:  We have measured the stellar kinematic profiles of NGC 3379 along four
position angles using the MMT. The data extend 90"" from the center, at
essentially seeing-limited resolution out to 17"". The mean velocities and
dispersions have total errors better than 10 km/s (frequently better than 5
km/s) out to 55"". We find very weak (3 km/s) rotation on the minor axis
interior to 12"", and no detectable rotation above 6 km/s from 12"" to 50"" or
above 16 km/s out to 90"" (95% confidence). However, a Fourier reconstruction of
the mean velocity field from all 4 sampled PAs does indicate a 5 degree twist
of the kinematic major axis, opposite to the known isophotal twist. The h_3 and
h_4 parameters are small over the entire observed region. The
azimuthally-averaged dispersion profile joins smoothly at large radii with the
dispersions of planetary nebulae. Unexpectedly, we find sharp bends in the
major-axis rotation curve, also visible (though less pronounced) on the
diagonal position angles. The outermost bend coincides in position with other
sharp kinematic features: an abrupt flattening of the dispersion profile, and
local peaks in h_3 and h_4. All of these features are in a region where the
surface brightness profile departs significantly from a de Vaucouleurs law.
Features such as these are not generally known in ellipticals owing to a lack
of data at comparable resolution; however, very similar behavior is seen the
kinematics of the edge-on S0 NGC 3115. We discuss the suggestion that NGC 3379
could be a misclassified S0; preliminary results from dynamical modeling
indicate that it may be a flattened, weakly triaxial system seen in an
orientation that makes it appear round.

Title:The rapid evolution of the born-again giant Sakurai's object,"
Abstract:  The extraordinarily rapid evolution of the born-again giant Sakurai's object
can be traced both in a continued cooling of the stellar surface and dramatic
changes in chemical composition on a timescale of a mere few months. The
abundance alterations are the results of the mixing and nuclear reactions which
have ensued due to the final He-shell flash which occurred during the descent
along the white dwarf cooling track. The observed changes in the H and Li
abundances can be explained by ingestion and burning of the H-rich envelope and
Li-production through the Cameron-Fowler mechanism. The rapidly increasing
abundances of the light s-elements (including Sc) is consistent with current
s-processing by neutrons released from the concomitantly produced 13C. However,
the possibility that the s-elements have previously been synthesized during the
AGB-phase and only mixed to the surface in connection with the final He-shell
flash cannot be convincingly ruled out either. Since Sakurai's object shows
substantial abundance similarities with the R CrB stars and has recently
undergone RCrB-like visual fading events, the ``birth'' of an RCrB star may
have been witnessed for the first time ever.

Title:High velocity gas from the Galactic dark halo,"
Abstract:  We present the germ of a new model for High Velocity Clouds, derived from the
idea that the dark matter halo of our Galaxy is in the form of cold,
planetary-mass gas clouds. In this picture HVCs arise as a result of disruptive
collisions between dark matter clouds: high velocity atomic gas is a natural
consequence of the dark halo kinematics, and is intimately associated with
assembly of the visible Galaxy. Quasi-spherical halo models predict a broad 21
cm line background, together with a number of individually detectable, low-mass
HVCs conforming to a particular velocity field. A halo model which incorporates
satellite substructure -- after the fashion of the current paradigm of
hierarchical structure formation -- includes both these components and, in
addition, some massive HVCs. These latter HVCs are simply the wakes of the
orbiting satellite halos, and each may have a mass up to 0.3% of the mass of

Abstract:  The large body of near infrared observations presented in Testi et al. (1997;
1998) are analysed with the aim of characterizing the young stellar clusters
surrounding Herbig Ae/Be stars. The results confirm the tendency of early Be
stars to be surrounded by dense clusters of lower mass ""companions"", while Ae
stars are never found to be associated with conspicuous groups. The transition
between the different environments appears to occur smoothly from Ae to Be
stars without a sharp threshold.
No correlation of the richness of the stellar groups detected is found with
the galactic position or the age of the central Herbig Ae/Be star.
The stellar volume densities estimated for the groups surrounding
pre-main-sequence stars of intermediate mass show the transition from the low
density aggregates of T Tauri stars and the dense clusters around massive
stars.
Only the most massive stars (10-20Msun) are found to be associated with dense
(10^3 pc^-3) stellar clusters. This is exactly the mass regime at which the
conventional accretion scenario for isolated star formation faces theoretical
problems. Thus our findings strongly supports the idea that the formation of
high-mass stars is influenced by dynamical interaction in a young cluster
environment.

The line energy is 6.1 - 7.0 keV (90% confidence) in the rest frame of 3C220.1.
Within the present statistics, the observed spectra are consistent with two

a 6.4 keV iron emission line, and a Raymond-Smith thin-thermal emission model
of kT ~6 keV with a metal abundance of ~0.5 solar. However, the large (~500 eV)

Sensitivity Survey: EMSS; and a sample of 654 ROSAT detected radio quasars. The
cosmological dipole moment is calculated for these samples, yielding the values
of $b \Omega_o^{-0.6}$. We find this factor to be $0.68 \pm 0.22$ for the EMSS
sample, and $1.02 \pm 0.014$ for the quasars sample. Comparing these values
with that of the IRAS 1.2 Jy sample $(1.95 \pm 0.096)$, suggests that these
AGNs are less clustered than the IRAS galaxies. For each sample there is a
depth at which the amplitude of the dipole growth curve saturates. This
convergence radius $(R_{conv})$ is found to be $\sim 300-400$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc for
the EMSS sample and $\sim 450-500$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc for the ROSAT detected quasars
sample, which suggests that X-ray AGNs have a much deeper contribution to the
Local Group (LG) motion compared to the galaxy and cluster samples. Using the
properties of the angular and spatial correlation functions for these samples,

Title:Accretion disk in Cyg X-1 in the soft state,"
Abstract:  We analyze the simultaneous ASCA/RXTE observation of Cyg X-1 in the soft
state on 1996 May 30. We apply a multi-color disk model with a torque-free
boundary condition in the pseudo-Newtonian potential, and point out the main
discrepancies between the commonly-used simplified `diskbb' model and our one.
We estimate the black hole mass and the accretion rate, and show that during
this observation the disk probably did not reach the last stable orbit and the
transition from the hard to the soft state was not completed yet.

Title:Puzzles of Galactic continuum gamma rays,"
Abstract:  Inverse Compton scattering appears to play a more important role in the
diffuse Galactic continuum emission than previously thought, from MeV to GeV
energies. We compare models having a large inverse Compton component with EGRET
data, and find good agreement in the longitude and latitude distributions at
low and high energies. We test an alternative explanation for the >1 GeV
gamma-ray excess, the hard nucleon spectrum, using secondary antiprotons and
positrons. At lower energies to fit the COMPTEL and OSSE data as diffuse
emission requires either a steep upturn in the electron spectrum below 200 MeV
or a population of discrete sources.

Title:Modelling the evolution of galaxy clustering,"
Abstract:  Measurements of galaxy clustering are now becoming possible over a range of
redshifts out to z=3. We use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to
compute the expected evolution of the galaxy correlation function with
redshift. We illustrate how the degree of clustering evolution is sensitive to
the details of the sample selection. For a fixed apparent magnitude limit,
galaxies selected at higher redshifts are located in progressively rarer dark
matter haloes, compared with the general population of galaxies in place at
each redshift. As a result these galaxies are highly biased tracers of the
underlying dark matter distribution and exhibit stronger clustering than the
dark matter. In general, the correlation length measured in comoving units,
decreases at first with increasing redshift, before increasing again at higher
redshift. We show that the epsilon-model often used to interpret the angular
correlation function of faint galaxies gives an inadequate description of the
evolution of clustering, and offers no physical insight into the clustering
process. We compare our predictions with those of a simple, popular model in
which a one-to-one correspondence between galaxies and dark halos is assumed.
Qualitatively, this model reproduces the correct evolutionary behaviour at high
redshift, but the quantitative results can be significantly in error. Our
theoretical expectations are in good agreement with the high redshift
clustering data of Carlberg etal and Postman etal but are higher than the
measurements of Le Fevre etal.

Title:Transmission and amplification of disturbances by massive halos,"
Abstract:  We study how massive halos respond to perturbations. Through numerical
solution of the coupled linearized Boltzmann-Poisson equations, we find that
halos transmit and amplify disturbances over large distances within galaxies.
In particular, as Weinberg has noted, the halo provides an excellent medium for
transmitting disturbances from the outer regions of galaxies to the inner
regions. The dipolar response typically dominates and, in some cases, is very
weakly damped. The monopole and quadrupole response can also make significant
contributions. Overall, the results support the notion that disk structure can
be excited by transmission of noise from the distant halo. The strong dipolar
response suggests that halos play a role in producing lopsided disks. These
results also suggest that, during formation from initial collapse, halos do not
settle rapidly into static equilibrium: instead, they may continue to ring and
interact with other embryonic components of the proto-galaxy

Abstract:  We study the effect of a finite topology on the temperature correlations of

the angular power spectrum are given for all possible finite flat models. We
examine the angular correlation function itself, pointing out visible and
discrete features that arise from topology. While observations of the power
spectrum on large angular scales can be used to place bounds on the minimum
topology length, cosmic variance generally restricts us from differentiating
one flat topology from another. Schemes that acknowledge anisotropic
structures, such as searches for ghosts, circles or geometric patterns, will be

Abstract:  We calculate the higher order moments in a sequence of models where the
initial density fluctuations are drawn from a chi^2_nu distribution with a
power-law power spectrum. For large values of nu the distribution is
approximately gaussian, and we reproduce the values known from perturbation
theory. As \nu is lowered the distribution becomes progressively more
non-gaussian, approximating models with rare, high-amplitude peaks. The limit
nu=1 is a realization of recently proposed isocurvature models for producing
early galaxy formation where the density perturbations are quadratic in a

Title:Formation of Interstellar Ices Behind shock Waves,"
Abstract:  We have used a coupled dynamical and chemical model to examine the chemical
changes induced by the passage of an interstellar shock in well shielded
regions. Using this model we demonstrate that the formation of water in a shock
will be followed in the post--shock phase by depletion of the water molecules
onto the grain surfaces. To attempt to discriminate between the creation of
ices behind shocks and their production by means of grain surface chemistry, we
examine the deuterium chemistry of water before, during, and after a shock. We
show that chemical evolution in the post--shock gas can account for both the
deuterium fractionation and the abundance of carbon dioxide relative to water
observed in interstellar and cometary ices. Given the pervasiveness of shocks
and turbulent motions within molecular clouds, the model presented here offers
an alternate theory to grain surface chemistry for the creation of ices in the
interstellar medium, ices that may ultimately be incorporated into comets.

Title:Substructure in Dark Halos: Orbital Eccentricities and Dynamical Friction,"
Abstract:  We examine the distributions of eccentricities of orbits within mass
distributions like those we see for galaxies and clusters. A comprehensive
understanding of these orbital properties is essential to calculate the rates
of physical processes relevant to the formation and evolution of galaxies and
clusters. We derive the orbital eccentricity distributions for a number of
spherical potentials. These distributions depend strongly on the velocity
anisotropy, but only slightly on the shape of the potential. We also present
high resolution N-body simulations of the orbital decay of satellite systems on
eccentric orbits in an isothermal halo. The dynamical friction timescales are
found to decrease with increasing orbital eccentricity, but the dependence is
weaker than previously suggested. The orbital eccentricity stays remarkably
constant throughout the decay; although the eccentricity decreases near
pericenter, it increases again near apocenter, such that there is no net
circularization. Finally, we discuss a number of applications. We find that the
distribution of orbital eccentricities of the globular clusters in the Milky
Way is consistent with a close to isotropic velocity distribution. The limited
data on the galactic system of satellites, however, appears to be different and
warrants further investigation as a clue to the formation and evolution of our
Milky Way and its halo substructure.

Title:The Survival of The Core Fundamental Plane Against Galactic Mergers,"
Abstract:  We have developed an effective simulation method and applied it to the
problem of the accretion of very dense secondary companions by tenuous
primaries. We have studied the accretion of objects of varying luminosity
ratios, with sizes and densities drawn from the core Fundamental Plane for
elliptical galaxies under the assumption that the mass distribution in the
central parts of the galaxies follows the light. The results indicate that in
mergers with mass ratios greater than 10, the smaller object is only stripped
down to the highest density encountered in the primary during the accretion
process. Thus, the form of the core Fundamental Plane suggests that the mass
distribution in these galaxy centers is different than the light distribution,
or that mergers on the core Fundamental Plane require more than the dynamics of
visible stars.

where the electromagnetic field exceeds the critical value, predicted by
Heisenberg and Euler for electron-positron pair production. In a very short

Abstract:  The type I X-ray burster and dipper 4U1915-05 (also known as XB1916-053) was
monitored by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer between February and October,
1996. The source was observed in various spectral states; the highest
luminosity state (LX ~ 1.5 10^37 ergs/s, 10 kpc, 1-20 keV) is associated with a
soft spectrum, whereas for the lower luminosity state (down to ~5 10^36 ergs/s)
the spectrum is significantly harder. Using the high time resolution data
provided by the Proportional Counter Array (PCA), we have discovered
High-Frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs) in the persistent X-ray
emission of 4U1915-05 while its luminosity was ~8 10^36 ergs/s. The QPO
frequency ranges from 600 Hz up to ~1000 Hz, with typical Full Width at Half
Maximum (FWHM) ~50-100 Hz and Root Mean Squared (RMS) values 15%. In addition,
by using the ``shift and add'' technique, we have detected a twin HFQPO (5.5
sigma level) separated from the main peak by ~355 Hz. 4U1915-05 is the eighth
Atoll source displaying simultaneous twin HFQPOs. Based on current knowledge of
HFQPO sources, our observations suggest that 4U1915-05 might contain a 2.8 (or

of the interstellar medium, which predicts that there should be on the order of
a thousand such conduits connecting the disk and the halo of a galaxy.
Where then are these structures and other possible disk-halo connections in
our galaxy? What do they look like, how can we detect them, and what do they
tell us about the interstellar medium and about the Galaxy?
We present a review of the observational evidence for Galactic disk-halo
connections, beginning with large scale searches and then concentrating on the
characteristics of selected candidates. We summarize how modeling these
structures can provide information on the structure of the interstellar medium
in which they evolved, focusing on the W4 superbubble and the Anchor as

Title:The Molecule-Rich Tail of the Peculiar Galaxy NGC 2782 (Arp 215),"
Abstract:  We present the first detection of a large quantity of molecular gas in the
extended tail of an interacting galaxy. Using the NRAO 12m telescope, we have
detected CO (1 - 0) at five locations in the eastern tail of the peculiar
starburst galaxy NGC 2782. The CO velocities and narrow (FWHM = 50 km/s) line
widths in these positions agree with those seen in HI, confirming that the
molecular gas is indeed associated with the tail rather than the main disk. As
noted previously, the gas in this tail has an apparent `counter-rotation'
compared to gas in the core of the galaxy, probably because the tails do not
lie in the same plane as the disk. Assuming the standard Galactic conversion
N(H2)/I(CO) factor, these observations indicate a total molecular gas mass of 6
X 10**8 M(sun) in this tail. This may be an underestimate of the total H2 mass
if the gas is metal-poor. This molecular gas mass, and the implied H2/HI mass
ratio of 0.6, are higher than that found in many dwarf irregular galaxies.
Comparison with an available H-alpha map of this galaxy, however, shows that
the rate of star formation in this feature is extremely low relative to the
available molecular gas, compared to L(H-alpha)/M(H2) values for both spiral
and irregular galaxies. Thus the timescale for depletion of the gas in this
feature is very long.

Abstract:  We present an analysis of the period distribution of $\sim 1800$ Cepheids in
the Large Magellanic Cloud, based on data obtained by the MACHO microlensing
experiment and on a previous catalogue by Payne-Gaposchkin. Using stellar
evolution and pulsation models, we construct theoretical period-frequency
distributions that are compared to the observations. These models reveal that a
significant burst of star formation has occurred recently in the LMC ($\sim
1.15\times 10^8$ years). We also show that during the last $\sim 10^8$ years,
the main center of star formation has been propagating from SE to NW along the
bar. We find that the evolutionary masses of Cepheids are still smaller than
pulsation masses by $\sim 7$ % and that the red edge of the Cepheid instability
strip could be slightly bluer than indicated by theory. There are $\sim 600$
Cepheids with periods below $\sim 2.5$ days cannot be explained by evolution
theory. We suggest that they are anomalous Cepheids; a number of these stars
are double-mode Cepheids.

early-type galaxies in two distant regions. We have obtained 1319 spectra of
714 early-type galaxies over 33 observing runs on 10 different telescopes. We
describe the observations and data reductions used to measure redshifts,
velocity dispersions and the Mgb and Mg2 Lick linestrength indices. Detailed
simulations and intercomparison of the large number of repeat observations lead
to reliable error estimates for all quantities. The measurements from different
observing runs are calibrated to a common zeropoint or scale before being
combined, yielding a total of 706 redshifts, 676 velocity dispersions, 676 Mgb
linestrengths and 582 Mg2 linestrengths. The median estimated errors in the
combined measurements are dcz=20 km/s, dsigma/sigma=9.1%, dMgb/Mgb=7.2% and
dMg2=0.015 mag. Comparison of our measurements with published datasets shows no
systematic errors in the redshifts or velocity dispersions and only small
zeropoint corrections to bring our linestrengths onto the standard Lick system.
We have assigned galaxies to physical clusters by examining the line-of-sight
velocity distributions based on EFAR and ZCAT redshifts, together with the
projected distributions on the sky. We derive mean redshifts and velocity
dispersions for these clusters, which will be used in estimating distances and
peculiar velocities and to test for trends in the galaxy population with
cluster mass. The spectroscopic parameters presented here for 706 galaxies
combine high quality data, uniform reduction and measurement procedures, and
detailed error analysis. They form the largest single set of velocity
dispersions and linestrengths for early-type galaxies published to date.

Abstract:  The chemical evolution of nascent quark matter core in a newborn compact

rate of strange quark production in degenerate quark matter core in presence of
strong magnetic fields is obtained. The investigations show that in presence of
strong magnetic fields a quark matter core becomes energetically unstable and
hence a deconfinement transition to quark matter at the centre of a compact
neutron star under such circumstances is not possible. The critical strength of
magnetic field at the central core to make the system energetically unstable
with respect to dense nuclear matter is found to be $\sim 4.4\times 10^{13}$G.
This is the typical strength at which the Landau levels for electrons are
populated. The other possible phase transitions at such high density and ultra

Abstract:  There are several supernova remnants which contain unresolved X-ray sources
close to their centers, presumably radio-quiet neutron stars. To prove that
these objects are indeed neutron stars, to understand the origin of their X-ray
radiation, and to explain why they are radio-quiet, one should know their
periods and period derivatives. We searched for pulsations of the X-ray flux
from the radio-quiet neutron star candidate RX J0822-4300 near the center of
the Puppis A supernova remnant observed with the ROSAT PSPC and HRI. A standard
timing analysis of the separate PSPC and HRI data sets does not allow one to
detect the periodicity unequivocally. However, a thorough analysis of the two
observations separated by 4.56 yr enabled us to find a statistically
significant period $P\simeq 75.3$ ms and its derivative $\dot{P}\simeq
1.49\times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$. The corresponding characteristic parameters of
the neutron star, age $\tau=P/(2\dot{P})=8.0$ kyr, magnetic field $B=3.4\times
10^{12}$ G, and rotational energy loss $\dot{E}=1.4\times 10^{37}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, are typical for young radio pulsars. Since the X-ray radiation has a
thermal-like spectrum, its pulsations may be due to a nonuniform temperature
distribution over the neutron star surface caused by anisotropy of the heat
conduction in the strongly magnetized crust.

Title:Accuracy of Mesh Based Cosmological Hydrocodes: Tests and Corrections,"
Abstract:  We perform a variety of tests to determine the numerical resolution of the
cosmological TVD eulerian code developed by Ryu et al (1993). Tests include
512^3 and 256^3 simulations of a Pk=k^{-1} spectrum to check for
self-similarity and comparison of results with those from higher resolution SPH
and grid-based calculations (Frenk et al 1998). We conclude that in regions
where density gradients are not produced by shocks the code degrades resolution
with a Gaussian smoothing (radius) length of 1.7 cells. At shock caused
gradients (for which the code was designed) the smoothing length is 1.1 cells.
Finally, for \beta model fit clusters, we can approximately correct numerical
resolution by the transformation R^2_{core}\to R^2_{core}-(C\Delta l)^2, where
\Delta l is the cell size and C=1.1-1.7. When we use these corrections on our
previously published computations for the SCDM and \Lambda CDM models we find
luminosity weighted, zero redshift, X-ray cluster core radii of (210\pm 86,
280\pm 67)h^{-1}kpc, respectively, which are marginally consistent with
observed (Jones & Forman 1992) values of 50-200h^{-1}kpc. Using the corrected
core radii, the COBE normalized SCDM model predicts the number of bright
L_x>10^{43}erg/s clusters too high by a factor of \sim 20 and the \Lambda CDM
model is consistent with observations.

Abstract:  We have carried out radio studies of the surroundings of the superluminal
microquasar GRS~1915+105. Our main goal was to understand the possible relation
of GRS~1915+105 with two infrared/radio sources that appear symmetrically
located with respect to GRS~1915+105 and aligned with the position angle of the
relativistic ejecta. We have also studied a nearby supernova remnant to test if
the event that created the remnant could have been the progenitor of this hard
X-ray binary.

"Title:The Microwave Background Bispectrum, Paper II: A Probe of the Low Redshift Universe","
Abstract:  Gravitational fluctuations along the line-of-sight from the surface of last
scatter to the observer distort the microwave background in several related
ways: The fluctuations deflect the photon path (gravitational lensing), the
decay of the gravitational potential produces additional fluctuations (ISW
effect) and scattering off of hot gas in clusters produce additional
fluctuations (Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect). Even if the initial fluctuations
generated at the surface of last scatter were Gaussian, the combination of
these effects produce non-Gaussian features in the microwave sky. We discuss
the microwave bispectrum as a tool for measuring a studying this signal. For
MAP, we estimate that these measurements will enable us to determine the
fraction of ionized gas and to probe the time evolution of the gravitational
potential.

"Title:Observational evidence for the accretion of low-metallicity gas onto the Milky Way; metallicity, physical conditions and distance limit for HVC complex C","
Abstract:  We present observations of the (field of the) Seyfert galaxy Mark290, which
probes the high-velocity cloud (HVC) complex C, one of the largest HVCs. We
find that this object has a metallicity of 0.094pm0.020(+0.022-0.019) times
solar. We determine a lower limit to its distance of 5 kpc (z>3.5 kpc). If the
gas is in thermal equilibrium with a hot halo, then it is also likely that D<30
kpc, putting the HVC in the Galactic Halo, as was the case for HVC complex~A
(for which z=2.5--7 kpc). We find that, on this sightline, H+ represents
23pm10% of the hydrogen in the HVC. The total gaseous mass is 2x10^6 (D/5
kpc)^2 Msun and, depending on whether the space velocity is completely radial
or vertical, the HVC represents a downward mass flux of ~0.036-0.083 (D/5 kpc)
Msun/yr, or 2.9--6.7x10^{-3} (D/5 kpc)^{-1} Msun/yr/kpc^2. The low metallicity
and large mass suggest that complex C is unlikely to be part of a Galactic
Fountain, but rather represents accreting low-metallicity material. It may be a
present-day analogue of the damped Ly-alpha absorbers seen in QSO spectra. Our
abundance result provides the first direct observational evidence for the
infall of low-metallicity gas on the Milky Way, required in models of galactic
chemical evolution. It remains to be seen whether ultimately complex C is a
remnant of the formation of the Milky Way (Oort 1970), a gas cloud orbiting the
Galaxy (Kerr & Sullivan 1969), a Local Group object (Verschuur 1969, Blitz et
al. 1996), the result of tidal interactions between the Magellanic System and
the Galaxy >3 Gyr ago (an ""Old Magellanic Stream""; Toomre, quoted in Kerr &
Sullivan 1969), or was formed when hot, ionized intergalactic gas was
compressed by the motion of the Milky Way (Silk et al. 1987).

Title:Spectrum of Cosmological Perturbations in the One-Bubble Open Universe,"
Abstract:  The spectrum of cosmological perturbations in the context of the one-bubble
open inflation model is discussed, taking into account fluctuations of the
metric. We find that, quite generically,thin wall single field models have no
supercurvature modes. However, single field models with supercurvature modes do
exist. In these models the density parameter $\Omega$ becomes a random variable
taking a range of values inside of each bubble. We also show that the model
dependence of the continuous spectrum for both scalar and tensor-type
perturbations is small as long as the kinetic energy density of the background
field does not dominate the total energy density. We conclude that the spectrum
of the density perturbation predicted in the single-field model of the
one-bubble open inflation is rather robust. We also consider the spectrum of
scalar and tensor perturbations in a model of the Hawking-Turok type, without a
false vacuum.

Title:A Comparison of Metal Enrichment Histories in Rich Clusters and Individual Luminous Elliptical Galaxies,"
Abstract:  Hot, X-ray emitting gaseous halos around massive elliptical galaxies are a
result of both stellar mass loss and inflow toward the overdensity from which
giant ellipticals and their associated galaxy groups formed. The metal
abundance in this gas contains important information about early star formation
and past supernova activity. We find that Type II supernovae based on a
Salpeter IMF, plus a small number of additional Type Ia supernovae, can explain
the the density, temperature and abundance profiles currently observed in
gaseous halos around massive ellipticals. Within the central, optically bright
regions of luminous ellipticals, approximately half of the interstellar iron is
produced by Type Ia supernovae and half by mass lost from evolving stars which
were originally enriched by Type II supernovae. However, iron and silicon
abundances in the intracluster gas within rich clusters suggest enrichment by a
larger number of supernovae per unit optical light than we require for massive
ellipticals, either more Type Ia or more Type II from a flatter IMF. Since the
enrichment histories of massive ellipticals and rich clusters are fundamentally
different, E and SO galaxies may not be the only sources of metal enrichment in
rich cluster gas.

Title:Three-Dimensional Simulations of Classical Novae,"
Abstract:  We present first results of three-dimensional (3D-) calculations of turbulent
and degenerate hydrogen-burning on top of a C+O white dwarf of one solar mass.
The simulations are carried out by means of a code which solves Euler's
equation for an arbitrary equation of state together with a nuclear reaction
network and the energy input from nuclear reactions on a Cartesian grid
covering a fraction of the white dwarf's surface and accreted atmosphere. The
flow patterns we obtain are very different from those of earlier 2D simulations
using the same initial conditions and the same numerical resolution. The
possibility of self-enrichment of the accreted hydrogen-rich atmosphere with
carbon and oxygen from the surface layers of the white dwarf during the violent
phase of the burning is investigated, and it is demonstrated that
self-enrichment proceeds too slowly if the accreted gas has near-solar
CNO-abundances at the onset of the thermonuclear runaway. As a result, we do
not find a fast nova outburst. This conclusion remains valid if the initial
metallicity of the accreted gas is raised by a factor of five. Therefore we
conclude that fast nova outbursts indeed require huge enrichments of C and O,
as postulated from spherically symmetric models, and that the mechanism which
leads to such enhancements must operate prior to the outburst.

Title:Dependence of the Frequency of the Kilohertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations on X-ray Count Rate and Colors in 4U 1608-52,"
Abstract:  We present new results based on observations carried out with the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer during the decay of an outburst of the low-mass X-ray binary
(LMXB) and atoll source 4U 1608-52. Our results appear to resolve, at least in
4U 1608-52, one of the long-standing issues about the phenomenology of the
kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs), namely, the lack of a unique
relation between the frequency of the kHz QPOs and the X-ray flux. We show that
despite its complex dependence on the X-ray flux, the frequency of the kHz QPOs
is monotonically related to the position of the source in the color-color
diagram. Our findings strengthen the idea that, as in the case of Z sources, in
the atoll sources the X-ray flux is not a good indicator of $\dot M$, and that
the observed changes in the frequency of the kHz QPOs in LMXBs are driven by
changes in $\dot M$. These results raise some concern about the recently
reported detection of the orbital frequency at the innermost stable orbit in 4U
1820-30.

Title:An analytic approximation of MDM power spectra in four dimensional parameter space,"
Abstract:  An accurate analytic approximation of the transfer function for the power
spectra of primordial density perturbations in mixed dark matter models is
presented. The fitting formula in a matter-dominated Universe
($\Omega_0=\Omega_M=1$) is a function of wavenumber $k$, redshift $z$ and four
cosmological parameters: the density of massive neutrinos, $\Omega_{\nu}$, the
number of massive neutrino species, $N_{\nu}$, the baryon density, $\Omega_{b}$
and the dimensionless Hubble constant, $h$. Our formula is accurate in a broad
range of parameters: $k\le 100 h/Mpc$, $z\le 30$, $\Omega_{\nu}\le 0.5$,
$N_{\nu}\le 3$, $\Omega_{b}\le 0.3$, $0.3\le h\le 0.7$. The deviation of the
variance of density fluctuations calculated with our formula from numerical
results obtained with CMBfast is less than 6% for the entire range of
parameters. It increases with $\Omega_bh^{2}$ and is less than $\le 3%$ for
$\Omega_bh^{2}\le 0.05$.
The performance of the analytic approximation of MDM power spectra proposed
here is compared with other approximations found in the literature. Our
approximation turns out to be closest to numerical results in the parameter
space considered here.

Title:Magnetic Fields on the Dynamics of the ICM,"
Abstract:  Could the discrepancies found in the determination of mass in clusters of
galaxies, from gravitational lensing data and from X-rays observations, be
consequence of the standard description of the ICM, in which it is assumed
hydrostatic equilibrium maintained by thermal pressure? In analogy to the
interstellar medium of the Galaxy, it is expected a non-thermal term of
pressure, which contains contributions of magnetic fields. We follow the
evolution of the ICM, considering a term of magnetic pressure, aiming at
answering the question whether or not these discrepancies can be explained via
non-thermal terms of pressure. Our results suggest that the magnetic pressure
could only affect the dynamics of the ICM on scales as small as $\la 1 {\rm
kpc}$. These results are compared to the observations of large and small scale
magnetic fields and we are successful at reproducing the available data.

Title:Optical morphology of distant RATAN-600 radio galaxies from subarcsecond resolution NOT images,"
Abstract:  We present direct imaging data of 22 ultra steep spectrum radio sources
obtained at (or near) a subarcsecond seeing. The basic sample of 40 double
radio sources was selected from the RATAN-600 catalogue. The FRII-structure has
been confirmed with VLA and preliminary optical identifications which come from
the 6 m-telescope. As the RATAN-600 flux limit at 3.9 GHz ($\approx$ 10mJy) is
fainter than that of major surveys, the sample may have high-$z$ contents. This
is also suggested by the faint magnitudes in the Hubble diagram. The final aim
is to create a homogeneous sample of high-$z$ radio galaxies in a well defined
strip around the sky, with faint radio limit and subarcsecond morphology down
to $m_{R}=24$.
We could confirm 16 identifications down to $m_{R}\sim$24. Most of the
extended objects have multicomponent structures as expected from other surveys
of high-redshift radio galaxies. We found five unresolved objects even with a
subarcsecond seeing. Of the remaining six objects, three are extremely faint
and the other three have such a complex environment that further observations
are needed to confirm the optical identification.

Title:Cosmic Rays and Neutrinos from Gamma Ray Bursts,"
Abstract:  We review the hypothesis that the acceleration of protons at internal shocks
in Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) could be the origin of the ultra-high energy cosmic
rays (UHECR) observed at earth, E_max > 10^19 eV. We find that, even though
protons may be accelerated to such energies, their ejection into the
interstellar/intergalactic medium is problematic because it is likely to be
accompanied by considerable adiabatic losses in the expanding shell. The
problem is circumvented by neutrons produced in photohadronic interactions,
which are not magnetically bound and thus effectively ejected in the moment of
their production. They can be both produced in sufficient number and be able to
leave the emission region if the optical depth of the emission region to
photohadronic interactions is of order 1. We show that this requirement can be
fulfilled under the same conditions which allow acceleration of protons to the
highest energies. The production of neutrinos in this process correlates the
fluxes of cosmic rays and neutrinos, and makes the hypothesis of UHECR origin
in GRBs testable.

of N V and C IV P Cygni line profiles. Analytic methods assuming a spherically
symmetric wind show that the wind velocity law is well-fit by v~(1-1/r)^beta,
where beta is likely 1.4-1.6 and definitely <2.5. Escape probability models can
fit the observed P Cygni profiles, and provide measurements of the stellar wind
parameters. The fits determine Lx/Mdot=2.6+/-0.1 x10^43 erg/s/Msun yr, where Lx
is the X-ray luminosity and Mdot is the mass-loss rate of the star. Allowing an
inhomogeneous wind improves the fits. IUE spectra show greater P Cygni
absorption during the second half of the orbit than during the first. We
discuss possible causes of this effect.

effectively produced. Both of these relics can produce now the particles, such

sources are critically reviewed and cosmic necklaces and monopolonia are
identified as most plausible sources. The relic superheavy particles and
monopolonia are shown to be clustering in the halo of our Galaxy and their
decays produce UHECR without the GZK cutoff. The observational signature of
both models are discussed.

Title:Searching for Unseen Planets via Occultation and Microlensing,"
Abstract:  The fields of occultation and microlensing are linked historically. Early
this century, occultation of the Sun by the Moon allowed the apparent positions
of background stars projected near the limb of the Sun to be measured and
compared with their positions six months later when the Sun no longer
influenced the light path to Earth. The measured shift in the stellar positions
was consistent with lensing by the gravitational field of the Sun during the
occultation, as predicted by the theory of general relativity. This series of
lectures explores the principles, possibilities and challenges associated with
using occultation and microlensing to discover and characterize unseen planets
orbiting distant stars. The two techniques are complementary in terms of the
information that they provide about planetary systems and the range of system
parameters to which they are most sensitive. Although the challenges are large,
both microlensing and occultation may provide avenues for the discovery of
extra-solar planets as small as Earth.

Title:H-alpha from High Velocity Clouds,"
Abstract:  Optical emission lines provide an important new window on the HVCs. Recent

with the neutral hydrogen in HVCs. The Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM)
instrument has so far detected H-alpha from high-velocity clouds in the M, A,

ionized portions of the HVCs with some evidence that the ionized gas envelopes
the neutral part of the clouds. The velocities of the H-alpha and 21-cm
detections are well correlated, but the intensities are not. If the clouds are
photoionized, the H-alpha intensity is a direct measure of the Lyman continuum
flux in the Galactic halo. Forthcoming observations of the H-alpha line in
combination with other emission lines will give new insights into the
high-velocity cloud phenomena and will also probe the physical conditions of

Abstract:  We reanalyze the ROSAT PSPC X-ray spectro-photometric observations of HCG 16.
Its X-ray morphology resembles its morphology at 20 cm, seen by the NVSS. We
detect diffuse emission in 8 regions filling half of the 200/h50 kpc (8.7"")
radius circle around the optical center of the group: one encompassing galaxies
a&b, two surrounding galaxies c&d, a clumpy region roughly 140/h50 kpc from the
group galaxies, which may be gas ejected from one of the galaxies, plus regions
associated with background galaxies, radio-sources or groups, and foreground
stars. Excluding the background / foreground sources, we get L_X^bol = 2.3
10^41 / h50^2 erg/s, i.e. half the luminosity found by Ponman et al. The
diffuse emission is cool (T < 0.55 keV [90% confidence] with a best fit T =
0.27 keV). The correction for photoelectric absorption in L_X^bol is a factor
3.5 and varies rapidly with temperature. The clumpy distribution of hot diffuse
gas in HCG 16 is illustrated by the low mean X-ray surface brightness and hot
gas density of the regions of undetected emission within 8' (at most 1/4 and
1/6 of those of the detected gas, assuming both have same temperature,
metallicity and clumpiness). The irregular X-ray morphology of the diffuse
emission rules out a (nearly) virialized nature for HCG 16, unless
intergalactic gas had sufficiently high specific entropy to be unable to
collapse with the group. Most of the diffuse gas originates from galaxies,
either through tidal stripping or through galactic winds driven by supernova
remnants. Our results show the need for a careful 2D spatial analysis and
multi-wavelength study of the diffuse X-ray emission from groups, suggesting
that other compact groups could be significantly contaminated by superimposed
X-ray sources.(abridged)

A systematic study is made of accretion to a non-rotating star, while sample

the Faint Object Spectrograph on HST (G270H grating) over the 2222-3277
Angstrom region with 200 km/s resolution. Low ionization lines of Fe, Mn, and
Mg were detected, leading to metallicities of -2.29, < -0.68, and > -2.4, which
are typical of other damped Lyman alpha systems, but well below the stellar
metallicity of this type of galaxy. Most notably, the velocity of the lines is
1160 +- 10 km/s, which is identical to the HI rotational velocity of 1170 km/s
at that location in NGC 4203, supporting the view that these absorption line
systems can be associated with the rotating disks of galaxies. In addition, the

Abstract:  We present high-resolution J-, H-, and K-band observations of the carbon star

unprecedented resolution of 70 mas. The H and K images consist of at least five
dominant components within a 0.21 arcsec radius and a fainter asymmetric
nebula. The J-, H-, and K-band images seem to have an X-shaped bipolar
structure. A comparison of our images from 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998 shows
that the separation of the two brightest components A and B increased from 193
mas in 1995 to 246 mas in 1998. The cometary shapes of component A in the H and
J images and the 0.79 micron and 1.06 micron HST images suggest that the core
of A is not the central star, but the southern (nearer) lobe of the bipolar
structure. The position of the central star is probably at or near the position
of component B, where the H-K color has its largest value of H-K = 4.2. If the
star is located at or near B, then the components A, C, and D are located close

"Title:Deep optical imaging of the field of PC1643+4631A&B, I: Spatial distributions and the counts of faint galaxies","
Abstract:  We present deep optical images of the PC1643+4631 field obtained at the WHT.
This field contains two quasars at redshifts z=3.79 & 3.83 and a cosmic
microwave background (CMB) decrement detected with the Ryle Telescope. The
images are in U,G,V,R and I filters, and are complete to 25th magnitude in R
and G and to 25.5 in U. The isophotal galaxy counts are consistent with the
results of Metcalde et al. (1996), Hogg et al. (1997), and others. We find an
excess of robust high-redshift Ly-break galaxy candidates with 25.0<R<25.5
compared with the mean number found in the fields studied by Steidel et al. -we
expect 7 but find 16 - but we do not find that the galaxies are concentrated in
the direction of the CMB decrement. However, we are still not sure of the
distance to the system causing the CMB decrement. We have also used our images
to compare the commonly used object-finding algorithms of FOCAS and SExtractor:
we find FOCAS the more efficient at detecting faint objects and the better at
dealing with composite objects, whereas SExtractor's morphological
classification is more reliable, especially for faint objects near the
resolution limit. More generally, we have also compared the flux lost using
isophotal apertures on a real image with that on a noise-only image: recovery
of artificial galaxies from the noise-only image significantly overestimates
the flux lost from the galaxies, and we find that the corrections made using
this technique suffer a systematic error of some 0.4 magnitudes.

"Title:Deep optical imaging of the field of PC1643+4631A&B, II: Estimating the colours and redshifts of faint galaxies","
Abstract:  In an investigation of the cause of the cosmic microwave background decrement
in the field of the z = 3.8 quasar pair PC1643+4631, we have carried out a
study to photometrically estimate the redshifts of galaxies in deep
multi-colour optical images of the field taken with the WHT. To examine the
possibility that a massive cluster of galaxies lies in the field, we have
attempted to recover simulated galaxies with intrinsic colours matching those
of the model galaxies used in the photometric redshift estimation. We find that
when such model galaxies are added to our images, there is considerable scatter
of the recovered galaxy redshifts away from the model value; this scatter is
larger than that expected from photometric errors and is the result of
confusion, simply due to ground-based seeing, between objects in the field. We
have also compared the likely efficiency of the photometric redshift technique
against the colour criteria used to select z>3 galaxies via the strong colour
signature of the Lyman-limit break. We find that these techniques may
significantly underestimate the true surface density of z>3, due to confusion
between the high-redshift galaxies and other objects near the line of sight. We
argue that the actual surface density of z=3 galaxies may be as much as 6 times
greater than that estimated by previous ground-based studies, and note that
this conclusion is consistent with the surface density of high-redshift objects
found in the HDF. Finally, we conclude that all ground-based deep field surveys
are inevitably affected by confusion, and note that reducing the effective
seeing in ground-based images will be of paramount importance in observing the
distant universe.

Title:Diffraction-limited Speckle-Masking Interferometry of the Red Supergiant VY CMa,"
Abstract:  We present the first diffraction-limited images of the mass-loss envelope of
the red supergiant star VY CMa. The two-dimensional optical and NIR images were
reconstructed from 3.6 m telescope speckle data using bispectrum speckle
interferometry. At the wavelengths ~0.8 \mum (RG 780 filter), 1.28 \mum, and
2.17 \mum the diffraction-limited resolutions of 46 mas, 73 mas, and 124 mas
were achieved. All images clearly show that the circumstellar envelope of VY
CMa is non-spherical. The RG 780, 1.28 \mum, and 2.17 mum FWHM Gauss fit
diameters are 67 mas * 83 mas, 80 mas * 116 mas and 138 mas * 205 mas,
respectively, or 100 AU * 125 AU, 120 AU * 174 AU and 207 AU * 308 AU (for a
distance of 1500 pc). We discuss several interpretations for the asymmetric
morphology. Combining recent results about the angular momentum evolution of
red supergiants and their pulsational properties, we suggest that VY CMa is an
immediate progenitor of IRC +10420, a post red supergiant during its
transformation into a Wolf-Rayet star.

independently also by Armandroff et al. (1999). The Calar Alto 2.2m images show
a low surface brightness galaxy. Its structure resembles that of the other
known dSph companions of M31 And I, II, III, and V. The brightest stars are
resolved in all three colors. Color-magnitude diagrams in either B-V or V-I
show the tip of the red giant branch which allows us to estimate a true
distance modulus of $24.5 \pm 0.2$. The color-magnitude diagrams and the
structure show no evidence for recent star formation, thus, a classification as
spheroidal dwarf galaxy with a rather old population seems appropriate. The
total absolute magnitude of this dwarf is $M_{V,0} = -10.4\pm0.2$.

Title:Time delay for the gravitational lens system B0218+357,"
Abstract:  Measurement of the time delay between multiple images of a gravitational lens
system is potentially an accurate method of determining the Hubble constant
over cosmological distances. One of the most promising candidates for an
application of this technique is the system B0218+357 which was found in the
Jodrell Bank/VLA Astrometric Survey (JVAS). This system consists of two images
of a compact radio source, separated by 335 milliarcsec, and an Einstein ring
which can provide a strong constraint on the mass distribution in the lens. We
present here the results of a three-month VLA monitoring campaign at two
frequencies. The data are of high quality and both images show clear variations
in total flux density, percentage polarization and polarization position angle
at both frequencies. The time delay between the variations in the two images
has been calculated using a chi-squared minimization to be 10.5+/-0.4 days at
95 per cent confidence, with the error being derived from Monte-Carlo
simulations of the light curves. Although mass modelling of the system is at a
preliminary stage, taking the lensing galaxy to be a singular isothermal
ellipsoid and using the new value for the time delay gives a value for the
Hubble constant of 69+13/-19 km/s/Mpc, again at 95 per cent confidence.

Title:Highly Ionized High Velocity Clouds,"
Abstract:  We have recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to study a pair of high
velocity clouds in the direction of Mrk 509 that have unusual ionization
properties. They exhibit strong CIV absorption with little or no low ion
absorption or HI 21cm emission. As the closest known analog to the outer
diffuse halos of damped Ly-alpha absorbers and the low N(HI) metal line
absorption systems seen in the spectra of high redshift quasars, these
""CIV-HVCs"" may shed new light on the origins of some HVCs, as well as present
opportunities for comparing absorption due to intergalactic gas in the local
universe with absorption in moderate-high redshift gas clouds. The CIV-HVCs
have ionization properties consistent with photoionization by extragalactic
background radiation and a location within the Local Group. The presence of
weak HI-HVCs detected through 21cm emission within 2 degress of the sight line
suggests that the CIV-HVCs trace extended, ionized, low density regions of the
HI-HVCs. In this article we summarize the results of our study of the CIV-HVCs
and suggest additional observations that would test the hypothesis of an
intergalactic location for the clouds.

Title:Anisotropic inverse Compton scattering in the Galaxy,"
Abstract:  The inverse Compton scattering of interstellar photons off cosmic-ray
electrons seems to play a more important role in the generation of diffuse
emission from the Galaxy than thought before. The background radiation field of
the Galaxy is highly anisotropic since it is dominated by the radiation from
the Galactic plane. An observer in the Galactic plane thus sees mostly head-on
scatterings even if the distribution of the cosmic-ray electrons is isotropic.
This is especially evident when considering inverse Compton scattering by
electrons in the halo, i.e. the diffuse emission at high Galactic latitudes.
We derive formulas for this process and show that the anisotropy of the
interstellar radiation field has a significant effect on the intensity and
angular distribution of the Galactic diffuse gamma rays, which can increase the
high-latitude Galactic gamma-ray flux up to 40%. This effect should be taken
into account when calculating the Galactic emission for extragalactic
background estimates.

resolution spectroscopic studies of the bright galactic supersoft X-ray source
RXJ0019.8+2156. Our photometry reveals a highly variable object. The shortest
observed quasi-periodic variations are humps with a period of approx 1.8h. The
timings of the main minimum are not exactly regular and occur on average around
phase phi=0.0. With our new data set we calculated an update of the orbital
period.
Our simultaneous spectroscopic and spectrophotometric studies from 1997 give
an even more detailed insight: blue and red shifted satellite lines at HeII
4686 and at the strong Balmer lines, which are interpreted as high velocity
outflows, can clearly be detected. We also present for the first time an
analysis of this supersoft source by means of Doppler tomography. The lines of
HeII (4542,4686), H_a and H_b show no emission from an accretion disk. These
emission lines originate in regions within the binary system with very low
velocities. The spatial origin of the emitting material is not quite clear and

Title:Prospects for Measuring Differential Rotation in White Dwarfs Through Asteroseismology,"
Abstract:  We examine the potential of asteroseismology for exploring the internal
rotation of white dwarf stars. Data from global observing campaigns have
revealed a wealth of frequencies, some of which show the signature of
rotational splitting. Tools developed for helioseismology to use many solar
p-mode frequencies for inversion of the rotation rate with depth are adapted to
the case of more limited numbers of modes of low degree. We find that the small
number of available modes in white dwarfs, coupled with the similarity between
the rotational-splitting kernels of the modes, renders direct inversion
unstable. Accordingly, we adopt what we consider to be plausible functional
forms for the differential rotation profile; this is sufficiently restrictive
to enable us to carry out a useful calibration. We show examples of this
technique for PG 1159 stars and pulsating DB white dwarfs. Published frequency
splittings for white dwarfs are currently not accurate enough for meaningful
inversions; reanalysis of existing data can provide splittings of sufficient
accuracy when the frequencies of individual peaks are extracted via
least-squares fitting or multipeak decompositions. We find that when mode
trapping is evident in the period spacing of g modes, the measured splittings
can constrain dOmega/dr.

Title:The initial stellar mass function from random sampling in hierarchical clouds II: statistical fluctuations and a mass dependence for starbirth positions and times,"
Abstract:  Observed variations in the slope of the initial stellar mass function are
shown to be consistent with a model in which the protostellar gas is randomly
sampled from hierarchical clouds at a rate proportional to the square root of
the local density. RMS variations in the IMF slope around the Salpeter value
are +/- 0.4 when only 100 stars are observed, and +/- 0.1 when 1000 stars are
observed. The hierarchical-sampling model also reproduces the tendency for
massive stars to form closer to the center of a cloud, at a time somewhat later
than the formation time of the lower mass stars. The assumed density dependence
for the star formation rate is shown to be appropriate for turbulence
compression, magnetic diffusion, gravitational collapse, and clump or
wavepacket coalescence. The low mass flattening in the IMF comes from the
inability of gas to form stars below the thermal Jeans mass at typical
temperatures and pressures. Consideration of heating and cooling processes
indicate why the thermal Jeans mass should be nearly constant in normal
environments, and why it might increase in some starburst regions. The steep
IMF in the extreme field is not explained by the model, but other origins are
suggested.

Title:Observation and Theory of The Initial Stellar Mass Function,"
Abstract:  Observations of normal galactic star-forming regions suggest there is
widespread near-uniformity in the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in spite
of diverse physical conditions. Fluctuations may come largely from statistical
effects and observational selection. There are also tantalizing, but uncertain
reports that the IMF shifts systematically in peculiar regions, giving a low
mass bias in quiescent gas, and a high mass bias in active starbursts.
Theoretical proposals for the origin of the IMF are reviewed. The theories
generally focus on a combination of four physical effects: wind-limited
accretion of stellar mass, coalescence of protostellar gas clumps, mass
limitations at the thermal Jeans mass, and power-law cloud structure. Hybrid
theories combining the best of each may be preferred.

Title:Gravitational Lensing by Cold Dark Matter Catastrophes,"
Abstract:  Intrinsically cold particle dark matter inevitably creates halos with sharp
discontinuities in projected surface density caused by the projection of fold
catastrophes onto the sky. In principle, these imperfections can be detected
and measured with gravitational lensing through discontinuities in image
magnification and image structure. Lens solutions are discussed for the most
common universal classes of discontinuities. Edges caused by cold particles
such as condensed axions and thermal WIMPs are very sharp, respectively about
$10^{-12}$ and $10^{-7}$ of the halo scale. Their structure can be resolved by
stellar and quasi-stellar sources which show sudden changes in brightness or
even sudden disappearances (sometimes within hours) as edges are crossed.
Images of extended objects such as edge-on galaxies or jets can show sudden
bends at an edge, or stretched, parity-inverted reflection symmetry about a
sharp line. Observational strategies and prospects are briefly discussed.

Title:The Propagation of Light Pollution in Diffusely Urbanised Areas,"
Abstract:  The knowledge of the contribution $b_d(d)$ to the artificial sky luminance in
a given point of the sky of a site produced by the sources beyond a given
distance $d$ from it is important to understand the behaviour of light
pollution in diffusely urbanized areas and to estimate which fraction of the
artificial luminance would be regulated by norms or laws limiting the light
wasted upward within protection areas of given radii.
I studied the behaviour of $b_d(d)$ constructing a model for the propagation
of the light pollution based on the modelling technique introduced by Garstang
which allows to calculate the contribution to the artificial luminance in a
given point of the sky of a site of given altitude above sea level, produced by
a source of given emission and geographic position. I obtained $b_d(d)$
integrating the contribution to the artificial luminance from every source
situated at a distance greater than $d$. I also presented an analitical
expression for $b_d(d)$ depending mainly from one parameter, a core radius,
well reproducing model's results.
In this paper I present the results for $b_d(d)$ at some Italian Astronomical
Observatories. In a diffusely urbanised territory the artificial sky luminance
produced by sources located at large distances from the site is not negligible
due at the additive character of light pollution and its propagation at large
distances. Only when the core radius is small, e.g. for sites in the inner
outskirts of a city, the sky luminance from sources beyond few kilometers is
negligible. The radii of protection zones around Observatories needs to be
large in order that prescriptions limiting upward light be really effective.

Title:Effects of Strong and Electromagnetic Correlations on Neutrino Interactions in Dense Matter,"
Abstract:  An extensive study of the effects of correlations on both charged and neutral
current weak interaction rates in dense matter is performed. Both strong and
electromagnetic correlations are considered.The propagation of particle-hole
interactions in the medium plays an important role in determining the neutrino
mean free paths. The effects due to Pauli-Blocking and density, spin, and
isospin correlations in the medium significantly reduce the neutrino cross
sections. Due to the lack of experimental information at high density, these
correlations are necessarily model dependent. For example, spin correlations in
nonrelativistic models are found to lead to larger suppressions of neutrino
cross sections compared to those of relativistic models. This is due to the
tendency of the nonrelativistic models to develop spin instabilities.
Notwithstanding the above caveats, and the differences between nonrelativistic
and relativistic approaches such as the spin- and isospin-dependent
interactions and the nucleon effective masses, suppressions of order 2--3,
relative to the case in which correlations are ignored, are obtained. Neutrino
interactions in dense matter are especially important for supernova and early
neutron star evolution calculations. The effects of correlations for
protoneutron star evolution are calculated. Large effects on the internal
thermodynamic properties of protoneutron stars, such as the temperature, are
found. These translate into significant early enhancements in the emitted
neutrino energies and fluxes, especially after a few seconds. At late times,
beyond about 10 seconds, the emitted neutrino fluxes decrease more rapidly
compared to simulations without the effects of correlations, due to the more
rapid onset of neutrino transparency in the protoneutron star

We present the upper limit luminosity function (LF) for low-luminosity AGN
(LLAGN) in two redshift bins to z=0.8. Mild number density evolution is
detected for nuclei at -18 < M_B < -14. The LFs appear to flatten at M_B > -16
and this flatness, combined with the increase in number density, is
inconsistent with pure luminosity evolution. Based on the amount of density
evolution observed for these objects, we find that almost all present-day
spiral galaxies could have hosted a LLAGN at some point in their lives. We also
comment on the likely contribution of these compact nuclei to the soft X-ray
background.

Title:Diffuse continuum gamma rays from the Galaxy,"
Abstract:  A new study of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray continuum radiation is
presented, using a cosmic-ray propagation model which includes nucleons,
antiprotons, electrons, positrons, and synchrotron radiation. Our treatment of
the inverse Compton (IC) scattering includes the effect of anisotropic
scattering in the Galactic interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and a new
evaluation of the ISRF itself. Models based on locally measured electron and
nucleon spectra and synchrotron constraints are consistent with gamma-ray
measurements in the 30-500 MeV range, but outside this range excesses are
apparent. A harder nucleon spectrum is considered but fitting to gamma rays
causes it to violate limits from positrons and antiprotons. A harder
interstellar electron spectrum allows the gamma-ray spectrum to be fitted above
1 GeV as well, and this can be further improved when combined with a modified
nucleon spectrum which still respects the limits imposed by antiprotons and
positrons. A large electron/IC halo is proposed which reproduces well the
high-latitude variation of gamma-ray emission. The halo contribution of
Galactic emission to the high-latitude gamma-ray intensity is large, with
implications for the study of the diffuse extragalactic component and
signatures of dark matter. The constraints provided by the radio synchrotron
spectral index do not allow all of the <30 MeV gamma-ray emission to be
explained in terms of a steep electron spectrum unless this takes the form of a
sharp upturn below 200 MeV. This leads us to prefer a source population as the
origin of the excess low-energy gamma rays.

Title:The Artificial Sky Luminance And The Emission Angles Of The Upward Light Flux,"
Abstract:  The direction of the upward light emission has different polluting effects on
the sky depending on the distance of the observation site. We studied with
detailed models for light pollution propagation the ratio $(b_{H})/(b_{L})$, at
given distances from a city, between the artificial sky luminance $b_{H}$
produced by its upward light emission between a given threshold angle
$\theta_{0}$ and the vertical and the artificial sky luminance $b_{L}$ produced
by its upward light emission between the horizontal and the threshold angle
$\theta_{0}$. Our results show that as the distance from the city increases the
effects of the emission at high angles above the horizontal decrease relative
to the effects of emission at lower angles above the horizontal. Outside some
kilometers from cities or towns the light emitted between the horizontal and
10~is as important as the light emitted at all the other angles in
producing the artificial sky luminance. Therefore the protection of a site
requires also a careful control of this emission which needs to be reduced to
at most 1/10 of the remaining emission. The emission between the horizontal and
10~is mostly produced by spill light from luminaires, so fully shielded
fixtures (e.g. flat glass luminaires or asymmetric spot-lights installed
without any tilt) are needed for this purpose.

Title:Polarization Structures in the Thomson-Scattered Emission Lines in Active Galactic Nuclei,"
Abstract:  A line photon incident in an electron-scattering medium is transferred in a
diffusive way both in real space and in frequency space, and the mean number of
scatterings changes as the wavelength shifts from the line center. This leads
to the profile broadening and polarization dependence on the wavelength shift
as a function of the Thomson optical depth $\tau_T$. We find that the
polarization of the Thomson-scattered emission lines has a dip around the line
center when $\tau_T$ does not exceed a few. Various structures such as the
polarization flip are also seen. An application to an ionized halo component
surrounding the broad emission line region in active galactic nuclei is
considered and it is found that the polarization structures may still persist.
Brief discussions on observational implications are given.

Title:The geometry of second-order statistics - biases in common estimators,"
Abstract:  Second-order measures, such as the two-point correlation function, are
geometrical quantities describing the clustering properties of a point
distribution. In this article well-known estimators for the correlation
integral are reviewed and their relation to geometrical estimators for the
two-point correlation function is put forward. Simulations illustrate the range
of applicability of these estimators. The interpretation of the two-point
correlation function as the excess of clustering with respect to Poisson
distributed points has led to biases in common estimators. Comparing with the
approximately unbiased geometrical estimators, we show how biases enter the
estimators introduced by Davis and Peebles, Landy and Szalay, and Hamilton. We
give recommendations for the application of the estimators, including details
of the numerical implementation. The properties of the estimators of the
correlation integral are illustrated in an application to a sample of IRAS
galaxies. It is found that, due to the limitations of current galaxy catalogues
in number and depth, no reliable determination of the correlation integral on
large scales is possible. In the sample of IRAS galaxies considered, several
estimators using different finite-size corrections yield different results on
scales larger than 20 Mpc/h, while all of them agree on smaller scales.

Abstract:  Number of monitoring observations of continuum emission from Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGNs) have been made in optical--X-ray bands. The results obtained so
far show (i) random up and down on timescales longer than decades, (ii) no
typical timescales of variability on shorter timescales and (iii) decreasing
amplitudes as timescales become shorter. The second feature indicates that any
successful model must produce a wide variety of shot-amplitudes and -durations
over a few orders in their light curves. In this sense, we conclude that the
disk instability model is favored over the starburst model, since fluctuations
on days are hard to produce by the latter model.
Inter-band correlations and time lags also impose great constraints on
models. Thus, constructing wavelength and time dependent models remains as a
future work.

"Title:The origin of carbon, investigated by spectral analysis of solar-type stars in the Galactic Disk","
Abstract:  Abundance analysis of carbon has been performed in a sample of 80 late F and
early G type dwarf stars in the metallicity range -1.06 < [Fe/H] < 0.26 using
the forbidden [C I] line at 8727 A. This line is presumably less sensitive to
temperature, atmospheric structure and departures from LTE than alternative
carbon criteria. We find that [C/Fe] decreases slowly with increasing [Fe/H]
with an overall slope of -0.17 +- 0.03. Our results are consistent with carbon
enrichment by superwinds of metal-rich massive stars but inconsistent with a
main origin of carbon in low-mass stars. This follows in particular from a
comparison between the relation of [C/O] with metallicity for the Galactic
stars and the corresponding relation observed for dwarf irregular galaxies. The
significance of intermediate-mass stars for the production of carbon in the
Galaxy is still somewhat unclear.

Title:Stellar Dynamics around Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei,"
Abstract:  We classify orbits of stars that are bound to central black holes in galactic
nuclei. The stars move under the combined gravitational influences of the black
hole and the central star cluster. Within the sphere of influence of the black
hole, the orbital periods of the stars are much shorter than the periods of
precession. We average over the orbital motion and end up with a simpler
problem and an extra integral of motion: the product of the black hole mass and
the semimajor axis of the orbit. Thus the black hole enforces some degree of
regularity in its neighborhood. Well within the sphere of influence, (i)
planar, as well as three dimensional, axisymmetric configurations-both of which
could be lopsided-are integrable, (ii) fully three dimensional clusters with no
spatial symmetry whatsover must have semi-regular dynamics with two integrals
of motion. Similar considerations apply to stellar orbits when the black hole
grows adiabatically. We introduce a family of planar, non-axisymmetric
potential perturbations, and study the orbital structure for the harmonic case
in some detail. In the centered potentials there are essentially two main
families of orbits: the familiar loops and lenses, which were discussed in
Sridhar and Touma (1997, MNRAS, 287, L1-L4). We study the effect of
lopsidedness, and identify a family of loop orbits, whose orientation
reinforces the lopsidedness, an encouraging sign for the construction of
self-consistent models of eccentric, discs around black holes, such as in M31
and NGC 4486B.

Title:Evidence for evolving accretion disk structure in 4U 1957+115,"
Abstract:  We present results of the first multicolour photometric study of 4U1957+115,
one of the optically less studied low mass X-ray binaries (LMXB). Our
quasi-simultaneous UBVRI observations reveal that the light curve pulse shape
over the 9.33 hr period discovered by Thorstensen (1987) has changed
substantially since his earlier V band studies. The light curve now shows clear
asymmetry and an amplitude more than double of that seen by Thorstensen (1987).
The light curve also shows colour dependence that seems to rule out the X-ray
heating model as an origin for photometric variability. We believe that the
changes observed in the light curve shape are indicative of evolving accretion
disk structure. We discuss implications of this on the origin of optical
emission in 4U1957+115 and disk accreting binaries in general.

Title:Spectral evolution of magnetic flares and time lags in accreting black hole sources,"
Abstract:  We present a model for the short timescale spectral variability of accreting
black holes. It describes well the time-averaged spectra as well as temporal
characteristics such as power-density spectrum, time/phase lags, and coherence
function of Cygnus X-1. We assume that X/gamma-rays are produced in compact
magnetic flares at radii < 100GM/c^2 from the central black hole. The tendency
for magnetic loops to inflate and detach from the underlying accretion disc
causes the spectrum of a flare to evolve from soft to hard due to the decrease
of the feedback from the cold disc, so causing time delays between hard and
soft photons. We identify the observed time lags with the evolution timescales
of the flares, which are of the order of the Keplerian timescale. We model the
overall temporal variability using a pulse avalanche model in which each flare
has a certain probability to trigger a neighbouring flare, thus occasionally
producing long avalanches. The duration of the avalanches determines the
Fourier frequencies where most of the power emerges.

Title:The mass function of M4 from near IR and optical HST observations,"
Abstract:  Deep images of the galactic globular cluster M4 taken at various locations
with the NIC3 and the WFPC2 cameras on HST were used to derive detailed local
optical and near IR luminosity functions. White dwarfs have been detected for
the first time on a color sequence at constant luminosity in the F110W band.
Transformation of the observed luminosity functions into mass functions via the
most up to date theoretical mass luminosity relations currently available
results in best fit local mass functions, that consist of a power-law with
single exponent x = -0.8 for the inner regions and a two-segment power-law
which rises with x = 1 down to M_{814}=8.5 and then drops all the way to the
detection limit with x = -0.3 for the outer regions.

Title:Formation of Primordial Protostars,"
Abstract:  The evolution of collapsing metal free protostellar clouds is investigated
for various masses and initial conditions.
We perform hydrodynamical calculations for spherically symmetric clouds
taking account of radiative transfer of the molecular hydrogen lines and the
continuum, as well as of chemistry of the molecular hydrogen.
The collapse is found to proceed almost self-similarly like Larson-Penston
similarity solution.
In the course of the collapse, efficient three-body processes transform
atomic hydrogen in an inner region of $\sim 1 M_{\sun}$ entirely into molecular
form.
However, hydrogen in the outer part remains totally atomic although there is
an intervening transitional layer of several solar masses, where hydrogen is in
partially molecular form.
No opaque transient core is formed although clouds become optically thick to
H$_{2}$ collision-induced absorption continuum, since H$_{2}$ dissociation
follows successively.
When the central part of the cloud reaches stellar densities ($\sim
10^{-2} {\rm g cm^{-3}}$), a very small hydrostatic core ($\sim
5 \times 10^{-3} M_{\sun}$) is formed and subsequently grows in mass as the
ambient gas accretes onto it.
The mass accretion rate is estimated to be $3.7 \times 10^{-2} M_{\sun}
{\rm yr^{-1}} (M_{\ast}/M_{\sun})^{-0.37}$, where $M_{\ast}$ is instantaneous
mass of the central core, by using a similarity solution which reproduces the
evolution of the cloud before the core formation.

Title:Optical identifications and spectroscopy of a faint radio source sample: the nature of the sub-mJy population,"
Abstract:  Deep imaging and spectroscopy have been carried out for optical counterparts
of a sample of 68 faint radio sources (S > 0.2 mJy) in the ``Marano Field''.
About 60% of the sources have been optically identified on deep CCD exposures
(limit R ~ 24.0) or ESO 3.6-m plates (limit bJ ~ 22.5). Thirty-four spectra
(50% of the total radio sample) were obtained with the ESO 3.6-m telescope and
30 redshifts were determined. In addition to a few broad line active galactic
nuclei, three main spectroscopic classes have been found to dominate the faint
radio galaxy population: (1) Early-type galaxies with 0.1 < z < 0.8. (2)
Late-type galaxies at moderate redshift (z < 0.4), with relatively bright
magnitudes (B < 22.5) and sub-mJy radio fluxes. (3) A group of bright
high-redshift (z > 0.8) radio galaxies with moderate-to-strong [OII] emission.
They have spectra, colours and absolute magnitudes similar to those of the
classical bright elliptical radio galaxies found in surveys carried out at
higher radio fluxes. Star-forming galaxies do not constitute the main
population of our radio sources identified with galaxies. In fact, even at
sub-mJy level the majority of our radio sources are identified with early-type
galaxies. This apparent discrepancy with previous results is due to the fainter
magnitude limit reached in our spectroscopic identifications. Moreover, using
mainly the large radio-to-optical ratio and the information from the available
limits on the optical magnitudes of the unidentified radio sources, we conclude
that the great majority of them are likely to be early-type galaxies, at z > 1.
If correct, it would suggest that the evolution of the radio luminosity
function of spiral galaxies, including starbursts, might not be as strong as
suggested in previous evolutionary models.

Title:YY Draconis and V709 Cassiopeiae: two intermediate polars with weak magnetic fields,"
Abstract:  We present data from long ROSAT HRI observations of the intermediate polars
YY Dra and V709 Cas which show that V709 Cas, like YY Dra, exhibits a
double-peaked X-ray pulse profile. Neither system shows evidence for X-ray beat
period or orbital modulation, so both must be disc-fed accretors seen at low
inclination angles. We argue that the short spin periods of the white dwarfs in
these objects indicate that they have weak magnetic fields, so the radius at
which material is captured by the field lines is relatively small. Consequently
the footprints of the disc-fed accretion curtains on the white dwarf surface
are large. The optical depths to X-ray emission within the accretion curtains
are therefore lowest in the direction along the magnetic field lines, and
highest in the direction parallel to the white dwarf surface, such that the
emission from the two poles conspires to produce double-peaked X-ray pulse
profiles. We emphasise that such a pulse profile is not a unique indicator of
two-pole accretion however. Indeed, two-pole accretion onto smaller regions of
the white dwarf surface may be considered the `normal' mode of behaviour in a
disc-fed intermediate polar with a longer white dwarf spin period (and
therefore a higher field strength), resulting in a single-peaked pulse profile.
Collating data on other intermediate polars, we may classify them into two
subsets. Fast rotators, with relatively weak fields, show double-peaked pulse
profiles (AE Aqr, DQ Her, XY Ari, GK Per, V709 Cas, YY Dra, V405 Aur), whilst
slower rotators, with larger fields and therefore larger magnetospheres, have
been seen to exhibit an X-ray beat period modulation at some time (FO Aqr, TX
Col, BG CMi, AO Psc, V1223 Sgr, RX J1712.6-2414).

Title:Contribution of Bright Extragalactic Radio Sources to Microwave Anisotropy,"
Abstract:  We estimate the contribution of extragalactic radio sources to fluctuations
in sky temperature over the range of frequencies (10-300 GHz) used for Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements. CMB anisotropy observations
at high resolution and low frequencies are especially sensitive to this
foreground. We have compiled a catalog of 2207 bright radio sources, including
758 sources with flux measurements at 90 GHz. We develop a method to
extrapolate the source spectra and predict skymaps of extragalactic radio
sources at instrument resolutions of 10 arcmin to 10 degrees FWHM. Our results
indicate that the brightest sources will dominate microwave anisotropy for a
wide range of resolutions and frequencies. Our skymaps predict the location and
flux of the brightest radio sources at each frequency, making it
straightforward to develop a template for masking the pixels containing them.
This masking should be sufficient to protect high resolution CMB anisotropy
observations from unacceptable radio source confusion.

Title:Can Dark Matter be Ultra Heavy Particles ?,"
Abstract:  The detection of High Energy Cosmic Rays (HECR) with energies around and
beyond GZK expected cutoff has introduced the idea of existence of a decaying
Ultra Heavy Dark Matter (UHDM). If this type of particles make a substantial
part of the CDM, their decay can have important implications for evolution of
the large structures and high energy backgrounds. Here we present preliminary
results of numerical solution of Boltzmann equations in presence of a decaying
CDM. The evolution of baryons and photons energy are calculated. We find that
in a homogeneous universe, UHDM can not have a large contribution to the CDM.
However, this hypothesis can probably survive if one takes into account the
clumsiness of the matter in the Universe.

Title:Probing Interstellar Turbulence in the Warm Ionized Medium using Emission Lines,"
Abstract:  The nature of turbulence in the warm ionized component of the interstellar
medium (WIM) can be investigated using Fabry-Perot spectroscopy of optical
emission lines. The H-alpha intensity provides the emission measure (EM) along
a line of sight, which is used in conjunction with the scattering measure,
rotation measure, and dispersion measure to study interstellar turbulence.
Observations at high spectral resolution (10 km/s) allow measurements of the
bulk radial velocity structure of the emitting gas and investigations of
thermal and non-thermal (turbulent) broadening mechanisms through the line
widths. By measuring the widths of the H-alpha line and an emission line from a
heavier atom (e.g. the [S II] 6716 line), one can separate the thermal and
non-thermal contributions to the line width. Preliminary studies using this
method have shown that the broad range of H-alpha line widths (typically 15 -
50 km/s) is mostly due to differences in the non-thermal component of the width
and that along many lines of sight this component dominates. The Wisconsin
H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) is in the process of producing a very sensitive kinematic
map of the northern sky in H-alpha at one degree angular resolution and 12 km/s
spectral resolution. WHAM is also mapping emission lines from heavier atoms
such as sulfur and nitrogen for selected regions of the sky. This data set will
provide unique new information concerning turbulence in the WIM.

Title:The Gaseous ISM: Observations with the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM),"
Abstract:  The Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) is a new facility dedicated to the study
of faint optical emission lines from diffuse interstellar gas. During its first
18 months of operation, WHAM carried out a survey of the interstellar H-alpha
emission associated with the warm, ionized component of the interstellar
medium. The observations consisted of 37,000 spectra obtained with a one degree
diameter beam on a 0.98 X 0.85 degree grid (lxb), covering the sky above
declination -30 degrees. This survey provides for the first time a detailed
picture of the distribution and kinematics of the diffuse ionized hydrogen
through the H-alpha line comparable to surveys of the neutral hydrogen obtained
through the 21 cm line. Preliminary reduction of the data from selected
portions of the sky reveal that the interstellar H II has a complex
distribution, with long filaments and loop-like structures extending to high
Galactic latitudes and superposed on a more diffuse background. Apart from the
H-alpha sky survey, WHAM has also detected for the first time faint diagnostic
emission lines in selected directions, [O I] 6300, [O III] 5007, and He I 5876,
which provide information about the physical state of the gas and clues about
the source of the ionization. Maps of [S II] 6716 and [N II] 6584 over limited
regions of the sky are providing information about variations in the
temperature and ionization conditions within the Galactic disk, and the
detection of faint optical emission lines from high velocity clouds is probing
conditions in the halo.

Title:Dust Versus Cosmic Acceleration,"
Abstract:  Two groups have recently discovered a statistically significant deviation in
the fluxes of high-redshift type Ia supernovae from the predictions of a
Friedmann model with zero cosmological constant. In this Letter, I argue that
bright, dusty, starburst galaxies would preferentially eject a dust component
with a shallower opacity curve (hence less reddening) and a higher opacity/mass
than the observed galactic dust which is left behind. Such dust could cause the
falloff in flux at high-z without violating constraints on reddening or
metallicity. The specific model presented is of needle-like dust, which is
expected from the theory of crystal growth and has been detected in samples of
interstellar dust. Carbon needles with conservative properties can supply the
necessary opacity, and would very likely be ejected from galaxies as required.
The model is not subject to the arguments given in the literature against grey
dust, but may be constrained by future data from supernova searches done at
higher redshift, in clusters, or over a larger frequency range.

Title:G359.87+0.18: An FR II Radio Galaxy 15 Arcminutes from Sgr A*. Implications for the Scattering Region in the Galactic Center,"
Abstract:  G359.87+0.18 is an enigmatic object located 15' from Sgr A*. It has been
variously classified as an extragalactic source, Galactic jet source, and young
supernova remnant. We present new observations of G359.87+0.18 between 0.33 and
15 GHz and use these to argue that this source is an Faranoff-Riley II radio
galaxy. We are able to place a crude limit on its redshift of z > 0.1. The
source has a spectral index \alpha < -1 (S \propto \nu^\alpha), suggestive of a
radio galaxy with a redshift z >~ 2.
The scattering diameters of Sgr A* and several nearby OH masers (~ 1"" at 1
GHz) indicate that a region of enhanced scattering is along the line of sight
to the Galactic center. If the region covers the Galactic center uniformly, the
implied diameter for a background source is at least 600"" at 0.33 GHz, in
contrast with the observed 20"" diameter of G359.87+0.18. Using the scattering
diameter of a nearby OH maser OH 359.762+0.120 and the widths of two, nearby,
non-thermal threads, G0.08+0.15 and G359.79+0.17, we show that a uniform
scattering region should cover G359.87+0.18. We therefore conclude that the
Galactic center scattering region is inhomogeneous on a scale of 5' (~ 10 pc at
a distance of 8.5 kpc). This scale is comparable to the size scale of molecular
clouds in the Galactic center. The close agreement between these two lengths
scales is an indication that the scattering region is linked intimately to the
Galactic center molecular clouds.

"Title:Pulsar Spin-up, Kinematics, and the Birthrate of Neutron Star Binaries","
Abstract:  From considerations of spin evolution and kinematics in the galactic
potential, we argue that the pulsars B1913+16, B1534+12, and B2127+11C may be
younger than previously assumed, and we find that a lower bound on the
formation and merger rate of close double neutron star binaries is $10^{-6.7}
f_b^{-1} f_d^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, where $f_b$ is the beaming fraction and $f_d$
accounts for the possibility that the known NS-NS binaries are atypical of the
underlying population (e.g., if most such binaries are born with shorter
orbital periods). If we assume no prior knowledge of the detectable lifetimes
of such systems, the rate could be as large as $\simeq 10^{-5.0} f_b^{-1}
f_d^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$. From both plausible bounds on $f_b$ and $f_d$, and a
revision of the independently derived limit proposed by Bailes (1996), we argue
that a firm upper bound is $10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also present a unifying
empirical overview of the spin-up of massive binary pulsars based on their
distribution in spin period $P$ and spin-down rate $\dot P$, finding evidence
for two distinct spin-up processes, one dominated by disk accretion, the other
by wind accretion. We argue that the positions of binary pulsars in the
$P$-$\dot P$ diagram can be understood if (1) there exists a Galactic
population of pulsars in double neutron star systems with combinations of spin
and orbital periods that have prevented their detection in surveys to date; (2)
recycled pulsars in wide-orbit binaries are not born near the canonical spin-up
line in the $P$-$\dot P$ diagram because they were predominantly spun up
through wind accretion; and (3) there exists a disfavored evolutionary endpoint
for radio pulsars with spin periods 5--30 ms and $\dot P > 10^{-19}$

Title:Lithium-6 : Evolution from Big Bang to Present,"
Abstract:  The primordial abundances of Deuterium, he4, and li7 are crucial to
determination of the baryon density of the Universe in the framework of
standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). li6 which is only produced in tiny
quantities and it is generally not considered to be a cosmological probe.
However, recent major observational advances have produced an estimate of the
li6/li7 ratio in a few very old stars in the galactic halo which impacts the
question whether or not the lithium isotopes are depleted in the outer layers
of halo stars, through proton induced reactions at the base of (or below) the
convective zone. li6 is a pure product of spallation through the major
production reactions, fast oxygen and alphas interacting on interstellar H, He
(especially in the early Galaxy). The rapid nuclei are both synthesized and
accelerated by SN II. In this context, the \li6 evolution should go in step
with that of beryllium and boron, recently observed by the Keck and HST
telescopes. Li6 adds a new constraint on the early spallation in the Galaxy. In
particular, if confirmed, the Li6/Be9 ratio observed in two halo stars (HD
84937, BD +263578) gives strong boundary conditions on the composition and the
spectrum of the rapid particles involved. We show that Li6 is essentially
intact in halo stars, and a fortiori \li7. We can define a range of the Li6
abundance in the very early Galaxy consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis
(5.6 10(-14) to 3. 10(-13) . Following the evolution at increasing metallicity,
we explain the abundance in the solar system within a factor of about 2.

of the adopted mixing length on stellar magnitudes and colors is discussed,
showing that the uncertainty on such a theoretical parameter prevents the use
of MS stars as bona fide theoretical standard candles. However, comparison with
Hipparcos data for field subdwarfs discloses a substantial agreement between
theory and observation. Present predictions concerning the magnitude of TO and
of HB stars are compared with similar results appeared in the recent
literature. We present and discuss a theoretical calibration of the difference
in magnitude between HB and TO as evaluated with or without element
sedimentation. Finally we use theoretical HB magnitudes to best fit the CM

metallicity galactic globulars, deriving an age of 11$\pm$1.0 Gyr and
10$\pm$1.0 Gyr, respectively, for the adopted chemical compositions, plus an
additional uncertainty of $\pm$1.4 Gyr if the uncertainty on the chemical
composition is taken into account. This result is discussed on the basis of

Abstract:  The 13-16 um region observed by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) of
several ABG stars are discussed. We present and analyse spectra of seven M
giants which show carbon dioxide features. To explain the features of the
bands, we suggest they originate from two different circumstellar layers, one
being a warm and high density layer close to the star, possibly making the 15
um band optically thick, and the other being a large, cold and optically thin
layer extending far out in the wind. This could explain the difference in

Title:Universe with the linear law of evolution,"
Abstract:  The model of the homogenous and isotropic universe is considered in which the
coordinate system of reference is not defined by the matter but is a priori
specified. The scale factor of the universe changes following the linear law.
The scale of mass changes proportional to the scale factor. The temperature of
the relativistic matter changes inversly proportional to the root of the scale
factor. The model under consideration avoids the flatness and horizon problems.
The predictions of the model are fitted to the observational constraints:
Hubble parameter, age of the universe, magnitude-redshift relation of the
high-redshift supernovae, and primordial nucleosynthesis.

Title:Polarization of radio cores as a test of the unified schemes,"
Abstract:  In the unified schemes for extragalactic radio sources, the quasars and BL
Lac objects are intrinsically similar to the Fanaroff-Riley class II and I
radio galaxies respectively, but appear to be different because they are viewed
at different angles to the line-of-sight. The quasars and BL Lac objects are
observed at small viewing angles while the radio galaxies lie close to the
plane of the sky. In such schemes, the quasar or BL Lac nucleus is hidden from
our view by a putative torus when the source is inclined at a large angle to
the line-of-sight and appears as a radio galaxy. Such a scenario should also
affect the observed polarization properties of the cores, with the cores in the
radio galaxies and weak-cored quasars being less polarized than the
core-dominated quasars and BL Lacs due to Faraday depolarization by the
magnetoionic medium in the obscuring torus or disk. In this paper, we report
that the core polarization of radio galaxies and weak-cored quasars is indeed
much smaller than for the core-dominated quasars and BL Lacs. We suggest that
this is due to the depolarization caused by the obscuring torus or disk,
providing further evidence in favour of the unified schemes.

Title:Distant clusters of galaxies in the ESO Imaging Survey,"
Abstract:  The results of a search for distant clusters of galaxies performed using the
I-band data obtained by the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) are presented. Cluster
candidates are identified using a matched filter algorithm, that provides not
only an objective detection criterion, but also the means to estimate the
cluster redshift and richness. A preliminary sample of distant clusters has
been obtained, containing 252 cluster candidates with estimated redshift in the
interval 0.2 < z < 1.3 (median redshift z_med ~ 0.4) over an area of
approximately 14 square degrees. The adopted selection criteria for the
inclusion of cluster candidates in this sample has been in general
conservative, as the primary concern has been the reliability of the candidates
rather than the completeness of the sample.

Title:Nuclear uncertainties in the NeNa-MgAl cycles and synthesis of 22Na and 26Al in classical novae,"
Abstract:  Classical novae eject significant amounts of matter into the interstellar
medium, as a result of thermonuclear runaways. Nucleosynthesis associated with
nova outbursts includes products from explosive H burning, such as 17O, 15N and
13C, and also radioactive species like 7Be, 22Na and 26Al. In this paper we
report on new hydrodynamic calculations of nova outbursts, from the onset of
accretion to mass ejection. We stress the role played by the nuclear
uncertainties associated with key reactions of the NeNa-MgAl cycles on the
synthesis of 22Na and 26Al.

Title:A Deep Survey of HI-Selected Galaxies: The Sample and the Data,"
Abstract:  In a 21 cm neutral hydrogen survey of approximately 55 sq deg out to a
redshift of cz=8340 km/s, we have identified 75 extragalactic HI sources. These
objects comprise a well-defined sample of extragalactic sources chosen by means
that are independent of optical surface brightness selection effects. In this
paper we describe the Arecibo survey procedures and HI data, follow-up VLA HI
observations made of several unusual sources, and Kitt Peak B-, R-, and I-band
photometry for nearly all of the galaxies. We have also gathered information
for some of the optically detected galaxies within the same search volume. We
examine how samples generated by different types of search techniques overlap
with selection by HI flux. Only the least massive HI object, which is among the
lowest mass HI sources previously found, does not have a clear optical
counterpart, but a nearby bright star may hide low surface brightness emission.
However the newly-detected systems do have unusual optical properties. Most of
the 40 galaxies that were not previously identified in magnitude-limited
catalogs appear to be gas-dominated systems, and several of these systems have
HI mass-to-light ratios among the largest values ever previously found. These
gas-dominated objects also tend to have very blue colors, low surface
brightnesses, and no central bulges, which correlate strongly with their
relative star-to-gas content.

Title:A Polarization Study of Radio Galaxies and Quasars selected from the Molonglo Complete Sample,"
Abstract:  We present total-intensity and linear-polarization observations made with the
Very Large Array at $\lambda$20 and 6 cm of a representative sample of 42 radio
galaxies and quasars selected from the Molonglo Complete Sample. The sources
have been chosen to be of large size to probe the depolarizing medium on these
scales using our present data and later with observations at lower frequencies
with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The $\lambda$20 and 6 cm data are of
similar resolutions and show that depolarization between these two wavelengths
is seen largely in only those lobes which are within about 300 kpc of the
parent galaxy. Examination of the depolarization of the lobes with arm-length
asymmetry shows that depolarization is observed predominantly for the lobe
which is closer to the nucleus. There is also a trend for the lobe closer to
the nucleus to be brighter, consistent with the scenario that the nearer lobe
is interacting with a denser environment which is responsible for the higher
depolarization and greater dissipation of energy. We have also examined the
depolarization asymmetry of the lobes on opposite sides of the nucleus for
galaxies and quasars. This shows that the depolarization asymmetry for quasars
is marginally higher than that for galaxies. The depolarization properties of
our sample are possibly determined by an asymmetric environment as well as the
effects of orientation.

Title:The Delta Scuti star FG Vir. IV. Mode identifications and pulsation modelling,"
Abstract:  This paper examines the mode identification and presents pulsation models for
FG Vir, for which 24 frequencies have been detected. Histograms of the
frequency spacings show peaks which are identified with adjacent radial orders
and rotational splitting.
Pulsational $\ell$ values are deduced for eight modes by comparing the
observed photometric phase lags between $v$ and $y$ variations with calculated
values. The dominant pulsation mode at 12.72 c/d can be identified with $\ell$
= 1, while the 12.15 c/d mode is the radial fundamental. These results are in
agreement with identifications published by Viskum et al. (1998).
Based on the observational mode identifications and the Hipparcos distance,
new models were computed with the constraint that the mode at 12.15 c/d is the
radial fundamental mode. It is shown that with standard opacities, models in
the appropriate T_eff, log L and log g ranges cannot reproduce the
identification in the literature of 23.40 c/d as the third radial overtone.
However, we show that observationally an $\ell$ = 1 (rather than radial)
identification is equally probable.
A large number of pulsation models were computed for FG Vir. A comparison
between the observed frequencies and mode identifications and pulsation models
leads to a mean density of <rho>/<rho_sun> = 0.156 +- 0.002 depending on the
opacity and chemical composition choice and on the possible overshooting from
the convective core. The models also correctly predict the observed region of
instability between 9 and 34 c/d.
The effect of rotational coupling on the pulsation frequencies is estimated.

Title:LS Peg: A Low-Inclination SW Sextantis-Type Cataclysmic Binary with High-Velocity Balmer Emission Line Wings,"
Abstract:  We present time-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of the bright
cataclysmic variable LS Peg (= S193). The Balmer lines exhibit broad,
asymmetric wings Doppler-shifted by about 2000 km/s at the edges, while the HeI
lines show phase-dependent absorption features strikingly similar to SW
Sextantis stars, as well as emission through most of the phase. The CIII/NIII
emission blend does not show any phase dependence. From velocities of Halpha
emission lines, we determine an orbital period of 0.174774 +/- 0.000003 d (=
4.1946 h), which agrees with Szkody's (1995) value of approximately 4.2 hours.
No stable photometric signal was found at the orbital period. A non-coherent
quasi-periodic photometric signal was seen at a period of 20.7 +/- 0.3 min.
The high-velocity Balmer wings most probably arise from a stream re-impact
point close to the white dwarf. We present simulated spectra based on a
kinematic model similar to the modified disk-overflow scenario of Hellier &
Robinson (1994). The models reproduce the broad line wings, though some other
details are unexplained.
Using an estimate of dynamical phase based on the model, we show that the
phasing of the emission- and absorption-line variations is consistent with that
in (eclipsing) SW Sex stars. We therefore identify LS Peg as a low-inclination
SW Sex star.
Our model suggests i = 30 deg, and the observed absence of any photometric
signal at the orbital frequency establishes i < 60 deg. This constraint puts a
severe strain on interpretations of the SW Sex phenomenon which rely on disk
structures lying slightly out of the orbital plane.

Title:Kinematic Effects of Tidal Interaction on Galaxy Rotation Curves,"
Abstract:  We use self-consistent N-body models, in conjunction with models of test
particles moving in galaxy potentials, to explore the initial effects of
interactions on the rotation curves of spiral galaxies. Using nearly
self-consistent disk/bulge/halo galaxy models (Kuijken & Dubinski 1995), we
simulate the first pass of galaxies on nearly parabolic orbits; we vary orbit
inclinations, galaxy halo masses and impact parameters. For each simulation, we
mimic observed rotation curves of the model galaxies. Transient
interaction-induced features of the curves include distinctly rising or falling
profiles at large radii and pronounced bumps in the central regions. Remarkably
similar features occur in our statistical sample of optical emission-line
rotation curves of spiral galaxies in tight pairs and n-tuples.

Title:The IMF in Young Galaxies: What Theory Might Tell Us,"
Abstract:  Observations have not yielded convincing results concerning the form of the
stellar initial mass function (IMF) or its variations in space and time, so it
is proposed that theoretical models may provide useful guidance. Several
classes of theoretical models for the physics controlling the IMF are reviewed,
emphasizing the dependence of the results on the probability distribution of
velocity and density fluctuations, the spatial density distribution, the
softness of the equation of state as controlled by the dominant heating and
cooling processes, the ambient radiation field, and the star formation rate
itself. One particularly relevant result is the ability of turbulent
interactions to form high-density condensations, which should vary with
decreasing redshift as the dominant cooling mechanism changes from H$_2$, to
fine structure lines, and finally to CO and gas-grain collisions, due to
corresponding changes in the effective polytropic exponent. A second theme is
the ability of some of these models to produce a characteristic or turnover
mass in the IMF which has nothing to do with the Jeans mass. Further
development of such models should provide IMFs whose functional dependence can
be used as input for simulations of galaxy formation, in which the energy input
from massive stars plays a crucial role, and for calculations of the
consequences of protogalactic star formation on the subequent evolution of the
universe. The probable irrelevance of the concepts of pressure-confined clouds
and the formation of condensations by thermal instability in a turbulent
interstellar medium is also discussed.

Title:AGNs with composite spectra II. Additional data,"
Abstract:  In a previous paper (Veron et al. 1997) we presented medium resolution (3.4 A
FWHM) spectroscopic observations of 15 ""transition objects"", selected for
having an ambiguous location in the Veilleux & Osterbrock (1987) diagnostic
diagrams, and showed that most of them were in fact ""composite"", this being due
to the simultaneous presence on the slit of both a Seyfert or Liner nucleus and
a HII region. Here, we report new spectroscopic observations of 53
emission-line galaxies with a ""transition"" spectrum, bringing up to 61 the
total number of observed objects in an unbiased sample of 88 ""transition
objects"". Almost all of the observed galaxies have a ""composite"" nature,
confirming the finding that true ""transition"" spectra may not exist at all. By
eliminating ""composite objects"" from the diagnostic diagrams, a clear
separation between the different classes of nuclear emission-line regions
(Seyfert 2s, Liners and HII regions) becomes apparent; by restricting the
volume occupied by the different line-emitting regions in the 3-dimensional
diagnostic diagrams, we are also restricting the range of possible physical
parameters in these regions. There seems to be no continuity between Seyfert 2s
and Liners, the two classes occupying distinct volumes in the 3-dimensional
space defined by [OIII]5007/Hbeta, [NII]6583/Halpha, and [OI]6300/Halpha.

Abstract:  We present sensitive, high resolution Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
observations of the central 0.3 arcsec of PKS 2322-123 at 1.3 and 5 GHz. These
observations reveal straight and symmetric jets emerging from both sides of an
inverted spectrum core. The 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen is detected in
absorption against the core and eastern jet with substantial opacities, but is
not seen towards the equally strong western jet. Both a narrow (110 km/s FWHM)
and a very broad (735 km/s FWHM) line are seen, although the very broad line is
seen only against the core. Both lines are redshifted (~220 +/- 100 km/s) with
respect to the systemic velocity. The most likely explanation for the observed
HI kinematics are an atomic torus centered on the nucleus with considerable
turbulence and inward streaming motions. The scale height of this torus is less
than 20 pc. Though rare in flux limited samples of compact radio sources,
symmetric parsec-scale structure appears nearly ubiquitous among radio galaxies
with HI absorption, probably because they are viewed more nearly edge-on
through the torus.

Abstract:  We present optical identifications and redshifts for seventeen new

remaining two are high-redshift, steep-spectrum, radio-loud quasars. These
objects were discovered as part of an ongoing study of compact (theta < 10
arcsec), moderately steep spectrum (alpha(1.4 GHz;4.8 GHz) > 0.75, S(nu) ~
nu^(-alpha)) sources from the MIT-Green Bank (MG) radio catalog (S(5 GHz) > 50
mJy). Spectra for the optical counterparts were obtained at the W.M. Keck
Telescopes and are among the optically faintest radio galaxies thus far
identified. Redshifts range between 0.3 and 3.6, with thirteen of the seventeen
at redshifts greater than 1.5. Combining these new radio galaxies with two
published MG radio galaxy spectra, we synthesize a composite MG radio galaxy
spectrum and discuss the properties of these galaxies in comparison to other,
more powerful, radio galaxies at similar redshifts. We suggest a radio
power-ionization state relation.

This forms a reasonably complete sample of nearby, bright, barred S0 and Sa

bars}. We also find an excellent candidate triply barred galaxy: NGC 2681.

Title:Optical spectroscopy of a brown dwarf candidate,"
Abstract:  We have used the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the Keck II telescope
to observe the brown dwarf candidate D04 (Hawkins et al, 1998). The spectrum
matches that of a spectral-type M7 dwarf, implying a photospheric temperature
of $\approx 2600$K. This is consistent with the available (R-I)$_C$ and (I-K)
colours. If the parallax measured by Hawkins et al is correct, then the
implication is that D04 has a radius of $\sim 0.035 R_\odot$, or one-third that
of Jupiter. This contradicts the predictions made by current stellar models
that electron degeneracy leads to nearly constant radii for stars and brown
dwarfs at masses below 0.1 M$_\odot$. We suggest that an equally valid
interpretation of the data is that D04 is a VB8 analogue at a distance of
$\approx 150$ parsecs.

Title:SHARC 350 Micron Mapping of the Galactic Center from the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory,"
Abstract:  Using the 20-pixel camera SHARC, we have surveyed the 350 micron emission
from a 60 arcminute by 12 arcminute region in the Galactic center. A comparable
region has been observed at 800 microns by Lis & Carlstrom (1994); the SHARC
map has better spatial resolution and sensitivity to extended emission,
however. This paper introduces several features not visible in prior maps of
dust emission. We have detected a 10+ pc band of emission peaking at l = -0.14
degrees, b = +0.02 degrees, which is probably associated with the 'negative
velocity arc' observed in 13CO (Bally et al. 1988). We suggest an association
of a rounded 350 micron feature near the Radio Arc with an expanding shell
observed in CS (Tsuboi, Ukita, & Handa 1997). Faint emission at the same
Galactic longitude as the Dust Ridge (Lis & Carlstrom 1994) but at opposite
latitude is visible as well as a compact source at the base of a thermal radio
filament at negative Galactic latitude. Diffuse dust emission within a few
arcminutes of the Sgr D core is detected for the first time. 350 micron sources
are associated with both H2O masers in Sgr D, but only one out of four OH
masers (Mehringer et al. 1998). The mean 350 micron / 800 micron flux ratio for
the Galactic center is approximately 17 (beta = 2.0) over the map but is higher
(beta = 2.5) in parts of the Dust Ridge and lower in Sgr B2 (N).

degraded in the direction towards the star. At a distance < 2 arcsec from the

still several magnitudes fainter than previous estimates. The implications of
the optical upper limit taken together with the high energy pulsed gamma-ray

Title:Can a supernova be located by its neutrinos?,"
Abstract:  A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several
neutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova
core over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic
radiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order
hours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in
the intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a
supernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a
supernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical
observations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic
assessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance
of the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward
scattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in
the presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.
Even with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and
the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to
be within circles of radius $5^\circ$ and $20^\circ$, respectively. Other
reactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful
for locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of
triangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an
arrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics
we show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a
good determination of the supernova direction.

Title:High Latitude Radio Emission in a Sample of Edge-On Spiral Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We have mapped 16 edge-on galaxies at 20 cm using the VLA. For 5 galaxies, we
could form spectral index, energy and magnetic field maps. We find that all but
one galaxy show evidence for non-thermal high latitude radio continuum
emission, suggesting that cosmic ray halos are common in star forming galaxies.
The high latitude emission is seen over a variety of spatial scales and in
discrete and/or smooth features. In general, the discrete features emanate from
the disk, but estimates of CR diffusion lengths suggest that diffusion alone is
insufficient to transport the particles to the high latitudes seen (> 15 kpc in
one case). Thus CRs likely diffuse through low density regions and/or are
assisted by other mechanisms (e.g. winds). We searched for correlations between
the prevalence of high latitude radio emission and a number of other
properties, including the global SFR, supernova input rate per unit star
forming, and do not find clear correlations with any of these properties.

Abstract:  To examine a recently proposed hypothesis that silicon nanoparticles are the
source of extended red emission (ERE) in the interstellar medium, we performed
a detailed modeling of the mean Galactic extinction in the presence of silicon
nanoparticles. For this goal we used the appropriate optical constants of
nanosized Si, essentially different from those of bulk Si due to quantum
confinement. It was found that a dust mixture of silicon nanoparticles, bare
graphite grains, silicate core-organic refractory mantle grains and three-layer
silicate-water ice-organic refractory grains works well in explaining the
extinction and, in addition, results in the acceptable fractions of UV/visible
photons absorbed by silicon nanoparticles: 0.071-0.081. Since these fractions
barely agree with the fraction of UV/visible photons needed to excite the
observed ERE, we conclude that the intrinsic photon conversion efficiency of
the photoluminescence by silicon nanoparticles must be near 100%, if they are
the source of the ERE.

Title:A Grey Radiative Transfer Procedure For Gamma-ray Transfer in Supernovae,"
Abstract:  The gamma-ray transfer in supernovae for the purposes of energy deposition in
the ejecta can be approximated fairly accurately as frequency-integrated (grey)
radiative transfer using a mean opacity as shown by Swartz, Sutherland, &
Harkness (SSH). In SSH's grey radiative transfer procedure (unoptimized) the
mean opacity is a pure absorption opacity and it is a constant aside from a
usually weak composition dependence. In this paper, we present a variation on
the SSH procedure which uses multiple mean opacities which have both absorption
and scattering components. There is a mean opacity for each order of Compton
scattering. A local-state (LS) approximation permits an analytic solution for
the gamma-ray transfer of scattered gamma-ray fields. The LS approximation is
admittedly crude, but the scattered fields are always of lesser importance to
the energy deposition. We call our procedure the LS grey radiative transfer
procedure or LS procedure for short. For a standard Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)
model the uncertainty in gamma-ray energy deposition is estimated to be of
order 10 % or less. The LS procedure code used for this paper can be obtained
by request from the author.
For completeness and easy reference, we include in this paper a review of the
gamma-ray opacities important in supernovae, a discussion of the appropriate
mean opacity prescription, and a discussion of the errors arising from
neglecting time-dependent and non-static radiative transfer effects.

Title:The Physical Nature of the Lyman Limit Systems,"
Abstract:  We analyze Keck HIRES observations of a Lyman limit system at z=2.652 toward
Q2231-00. These observations afford the most comprehensive study of the
physical properties of a LL system to date. By comparing the ionic column
densities for Fe^+, Fe^{++}, Si^+, and Si^{3+} against calculations derived
from the CLOUDY software package, we have strictly constrained the ionization
state of this system. This has enabled us to calculate accurate abundances of a
Lyman limit system for the first time at z > 2, e.g., [Fe/H] = -0.5 \pm 0.1. We
also derive a total hydrogen column density, log N(H) = 20.73 \pm 0.2, which is
comparable to values observed for the damped lya systems.
The system is special for exhibiting CII* 1335 absorption, allowing an
estimate of the electron density, n_e = 6.5 \pm 1.3 x 10^{-2} cm^{-3}. Coupling
this measurement with our knowledge of the ionization state, we derive the
following physical properties: (1) hydrogen volume density, n_H = 5.9 \pm 1.2 x
10^{-2} cm^{-3}, (2) path length, l = 3 \pm 1.6 kpc, and (3) ionizing

of a damped system. The techniques introduced in this Letter should be

Title:Forecasting foreground impact on cosmic microwave background measurements,"
Abstract:  We explore the possible impact of galactic and extragalactic foregrounds on
measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that, given our
present understanding of the foregrounds, they are unlikely to qualitatively
affect the ability of the MAP and Planck satellites to determine the angular
power spectrum of the CMB, the key statistic for constraining cosmological
parameters. Sufficiently far from the galactic plane, the only foregrounds that
will affect power spectrum determination with any significance are the
extragalactic ones. For MAP we find the most troublesome foregrounds are radio
point sources and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. For Planck they
are these same radio point sources and the Far Infrared Background. Prior
knowledge of the statistics of the SZ component (either via theoretical
calculation, or higher frequency observations of just a few percent of the sky,
such as will be done by balloon-borne experiments) may significantly improve
MAP's determination of the CMB power spectrum. We also explore the foreground
impact on MAP and Planck polarization power spectrum measurements.

Title:Prospects of solar axion searches with crystal detectors,"
Abstract:  A calculation of the expected signal due to Primakoff coherent conversion of
solar axions into photons via Bragg scattering in several crystal detectors is
presented. The results are confronted with the experimental sensitivities of
present and future experiments concluding that the sensitivity of crystal
detectors does not challenge the globular cluster limit on the axion-photon
coupling g_a. In particular, in the axion mass window m_a ~> 0.03 eV explored
with this technique (not accessible at present by other methods) g_a might be
constrained down to 10^-9 GeV^-1 (the recent helioseismological bound) provided
that significant improvements in the parameters and performances of these
detectors be achieved and large statistics accumulated. This bound should be
considered as a minimal goal for the sensitivity of future crystal experiments.
Consequently, finding a positive signal at this level of sensitivity would
necessarily imply revisiting other more stringent astrophysical limits derived
for the same range of m_a values.

Title:Beyond the Simplest Inflationary Cosmological Models,"
Abstract:  Though predictions of the simplest inflationary cosmological models with cold
dark matter, flat space and approximately flat initial spectrum of adiabatic
perturbations are remarkably close to observational data, we have to go beyond
them and to introduce new physics not yet discovered in laboratories to account
for all data. Two extensions of these models which seem to be the most actual
at present time are discussed. The first one is the possibility that we are
living at the beginning of a new inflation-like era. Then classical
cosmological tests, like the luminosity distance or the angular size of distant
objects as functions of redshift, as well as the behaviour of density
perturbations in a dustlike matter component including baryons as a function of
redshift, can provide information sufficient for the unambiguous determination
of an effective potential of a corresponding present inflaton scalar field. The
second, unrelated extension is a possibility of broken-scale-invariant
cosmological models which have localized steps or spikes in the primordial
perturbation spectrum. These features can be produced by fast phase transitions
in physical fields other than an inflaton field in the early Universe during
inflation and not far from the end of it. At present, it seems that the only
scale in the spectrum around which we might see something of this type is
$k=0.05 h Mpc^{-1}$.

Title:Cosmic Rays in the Galactic Center Region,"
Abstract:  EGRET data on the Gamma ray emission from the inner Galaxy have shown a
rather flat spectrum, extending to about 50 GeV. It is usually assumed that
these gamma-rays arise from the interactions of cosmic ray nuclei with ambient
matter. Cosmic Ray particles have been observed up to 3 10^20 eV, with many
arguments suggesting, that up to about 3 10^18 eV they are of Galactic origin.
Cosmic ray particles get injected by supernova explosions. Their injected
spectrum is steepened by diffusive losses from the Galaxy to yield the observed
spectrum. As cosmic ray particles roam around in the Galactic disk, they
encounter molecular clouds and through p-p collisions produce gamma rays from
pion decay. The flux and spectrum of these gamma rays is then a clear signature
of cosmic rays throughout the Galaxy. Star formation activity peaks in the
central region of the Galaxy, around the Galactic Center. Looking then at the
gamma ray spectrum of the central region of our Galaxy yields clues as to where
the cosmic ray particles interact, and with what spectrum. Using the FLUKA
Monte-Carlo, we have modelled this spectrum, and find a best fit for a powerlaw
spectral index of 2.34, rather close to the suggested injection spectrum for
supernovae which explode into their own winds. This suggests that most cosmic
ray interaction happens near the sources of injection; this is consistent with
the spectrum of cosmic ray nuclei derived from spallation. One consequence is
that cosmic ray heating and ionization should be strong in the Galactic Center
region.

Title:Cosmology Solved? Quite Possibly!,"
Abstract:  The discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in 1964 by Penzias and
Wilson led to the establishment of the hot big-bang cosmological model some ten
years later. Discoveries made in 1998 may ultimately have as profound an effect

unanswered by the hot big-bang model and holds that the Universe is flat,
slowly moving elementary particles provide the cosmic infrastructure, and
quantum fluctuations seeded all the structure seen in the Universe today. Just
as it took a decade to establish the hot big-bang model after the discovery of
the CMB, it will likely take another ten years to establish the latest addition
to the standard cosmology and make the answer to ``Cosmology Solved?'',
``YES!'' Whether or not 1998 proves to be a cosmic milestone, the coming
avalanche of high-quality cosmological data promises to make the next twenty

Abstract:  The large supercluster structures obvious in recent galaxy redshift surveys
are quantified using an one-dimensional cluster analysis (core sampling) and a
three-dimensional cluster analysis based on the minimal spanning tree. The
comparison with the LCRS reveals promising stable results. At a mean
overdensity of about ten, the supercluster systems form huge wall-like
structures comprising about 40% of all galaxies. The overdense clusters have a
low mean transverse velocity dispersion of about 400 km/s, i.e. they look quite
narrow in redshift space. We performed N-body simulations with large box sizes
for six cosmological scenarios. The quantitative analysis shows that the

Title:Cosmology Solved? Maybe,"
Abstract:  For two decades the hot big-bang model as been referred to as the standard
cosmology -- and for good reason. For just as long cosmologists have known that
there are fundamental questions that are not answered by the standard cosmology
and point to a grander theory. The best candidate for that grander theory is
inflation + cold dark matter. It holds that the Universe is flat, that slowly
moving elementary particles left over from the earliest moments provide the
cosmic infrastructure, and that the primeval density inhomogeneities that seed
all the structure arose from quantum fluctuations. There is now prima facie
evidence that supports two basic tenets of this paradigm. An avalanche of
high-quality cosmological observations will soon make this case stronger or
will break it. Key questions remain to be answered; foremost among them are:
identification and detection of the cold dark matter particles and elucidation
of the dark-energy component. These are exciting times in cosmology!

Title:Magnetic propeller outflows,"
Abstract:  A model is developed for magnetic `propeller'-driven outflows which cause a
rapidly rotating magnetized star accreting from a disk to spin-down. Energy and
angular momentum lost by the star goes into expelling most of the accreting
disk matter. The theory gives an expression for the effective Alfven radius
$R_A$ (where the inflowing matter is effectively stopped) which depends on the
mass accretion rate, the star's mass and magnetic moment, and the star's
rotation rate. The model points to a mechanism for `jumps' between spin-down
and spin-up evolution and for the reverse transition, which are changes between
two possible equilibrium configurations of the system. In for example the
transistion from spin-down to spin-up states the Alfven radius $R_A$ decreases
from a value larger than the corotation radius to one which is smaller. In this
transistion the `propeller' goes from being ``on'' to being ``off.'' The ratio
of the spin-down to spin-up torque (or the ratio for the reverse change) in a
jump is shown to be of order unity.

Title:Canaries in a Coal Mine: Using Globular Clusters to Place Limits on Massive Black Holes in the Galactic Halo,"
Abstract:  We explore the possibility that massive black holes comprise a significant
fraction of the dark matter of our galaxy by studying the dissolution of
galactic globular clusters bombarded by them. In our simulations, we evolve the
clusters along a sequence of King models determined by changes of state
resulting from collisions with the black holes. The results divide naturally
into regimes of `small' and `large' black hole mass. `Small' black holes do not
destroy clusters in single collisions; their effect is primarily cumulative,
leading to a relation between $\mbh$ and $\fhalo$, the fraction of the halo in
black holes of mass $\mbh$, which is $\fhalo\mbh < $ constant (up to
logarithmic corrections). For $\fhalo=1$, we find $\mbh \simless 10^{3} \msun$
by requiring survival of the same clusters studied by Moore (1993), who
neglected cluster evolution, mass loss, and stochasticity of energy inputs in
his estimates, but reached a similar conclusion. `Large' black holes may not
penetrate a cluster without disrupting it; their effect is mainly catastrophic
(close collisions), but also partly cumulative (distant collisions). In the
large $\mbh$ limit, $\fhalo$ (but not $\mbh$) can be constrained by computing
the probability that a cluster survives a combination of close, destructive
encounters and distant, nondestructive encounters. We find that it is unlikely
that $\fhalo \simgreat 0.3$ by requiring 50 per cent survival probability for
Moore's clusters over $10^{10}$ years.

Title:Neutrino-Nucleon Interactions in Magnetized Neutron-Star Matter: The Effects of Parity Violation,"
Abstract:  We study neutrino-nucleon scattering and absorption in a dense, magnetized
nuclear medium. These are the most important sources of neutrino opacity
governing the cooling of a proto-neutron star in the first tens of seconds
after its formation. Because the weak interaction is parity violating, the
absorption and scattering cross-sections depend asymmetrically on the
directions of the neutrino momenta with respect to the magnetic field. We
develop the moment formalism of neutrino transport in the presence of such
asymmetric opacities and derive explicit expressions for the neutrino flux and
other angular moments of the Boltzmann transport equation. For a given neutrino
species, there is a drift flux of neutrinos along the magnetic field in
addition to the usual diffusive flux. This drift flux depends on the deviation
of the neutrino distribution function from thermal equilibrium. Hence, despite
the fact that the neutrino cross-sections are asymmetric throughout the star,
asymmetric neutrino flux can be generated only in the outer region of the
proto-neutron star where the neutrino distribution deviates significantly from
thermal equilibrium. In addition to the asymmetric absorption opacity arising
from nucleon polarization, we find the contribution of the electron (or
positron) ground state Landau level. For neutrinos of energy less than a few
times the temperature, this is the dominant source of asymmetric opacity.
Lastly, we discuss the implication of our result to the origin of pulsar kicks:
in order to generate kick velocity of a few hundred km/s from asymmetric
neutrino emission using the parity violation effect, the proto-neutron star
must have a dipole magnetic field of at least $10^{15}-10^{16}$ G.

Title:The Post-Common Envelope and Pre-Cataclysmic Binary PG 1224+309,"
Abstract:  We have made extensive spectroscopic and photometric observations of PG
1224+309, a close binary containing a DA white dwarf primary and an M4+
secondary. The H alpha line is in emission due to irradiation of the M-star by
the hot white dwarf and is seen to vary around the orbit. From the radial
velocities of the H alpha line we derive a period of P = 0.258689 +/- 0.000004
days and a semi-amplitude of K_Halpha = 160 +/- 8 km/s. We estimate a
correction Delta_K = 21 +/- 2 km/s, where K_M = K_Halpha + Delta_K. Radial
velocity variations of the white dwarf reveal a semi-amplitude of K_WD = 112
+/- 14 km/s. The blue spectrum of the white dwarf is well fit by a synthetic
spectrum having T_eff = 29,300 K and log(g) = 7.38. The white dwarf contributes
97% of the light at 4500 Angstroms and virtually all of the light blueward of
3800 Angstroms. No eclipses are observed. The mass inferred for the white dwarf
depends on the assumed mass of the thin residual hydrogen envelope: 0.40 < M_WD
< 0.45 solar masses for hydrogen envelope masses of 0 < M_H < 4.0E-4 solar
masses. We argue that the mass of the white dwarf is closer to 0.45 solar
masses, hence it appears that the white dwarf has a relatively large residual
hydrogen envelope. The mass of the M-star is then M_M = 0.28 +/- 0.05 solar
masses, and the inclination is i = 77 +/- 7 degrees. We discuss briefly how PG
1224+309 may be used to constrain theories of close binary star evolution, and
the past and future histories of PG 1224+309 itself. The star is both a
``post-common envelope'' star and a ``pre-cataclysmic binary'' star. Mass
transfer by Roche-lobe overflow should commence in about 10 Gyr.

Title:Towards an Understanding of the Globular Cluster Over--abundance around the Central Giant Elliptical NGC 1399,"
Abstract:  We investigate the kinematics of a combined sample of 74 globular clusters
around NGC 1399. Their high velocity dispersion, increasing with radius,
supports their association with the gravitational potential of the galaxy
cluster rather than with that of NGC 1399 itself. We find no evidence for
rotation in the full sample, although some indication for rotation in the outer
regions. The data do not allow us to detect differences between the kinematics
of the blue and red sub-populations of globular clusters.
A comparison between the globular cluster systems of NGC 1399 and those of
NGC 1404 and NGC 1380 indicates that the globular clusters in all three
galaxies are likely to have formed via similar mechanisms and at similar
epochs. The only property which distinguishes the NGC 1399 globular cluster
system from these others is that it is ten times more abundant. We summarize
the evidence for associating these excess globulars with the galaxy cluster
rather than with NGC 1399 itself, and suggest that the over-abundance can be
explained by tidal stripping, at an early epoch, of neighboring galaxies and
subsequent accumulation of globulars in the gravitational potential of the
galaxy cluster.

Title:The circumnuclear disk and ionized gas filaments as remnants of tidally disrupted clouds,"
Abstract:  Sticky particle calculations indicate that a coherent structure, a dispersion
ring, forms when a cloud on a low angular momentum orbit passes close to the
dynamical center of an isothermal sphere containing a central point mass. The
cloud is tidally stretched and differentially wrapped, and dissipation in
shocks organizes the gas into a precessing off-set elliptical ring which can
persist for many rotation periods. The morphology and kinematics of the
circumnuclear disk (CND) between 2 and 5 pc and the Northern arm in the inner 1
pc are well-represented by such structures. In the case of the Northern Arm,
strong shocks which arise during the formation of the dispersion ring can lead
to star formation even in the near tidal field of a massive black hole.

Abstract:  NGC 4736 is a nearby Sab spiral galaxy, hosting one of the closest examples

characterise the X-ray properties of this galaxy. Twelve discrete X-ray sources
are detected within the region subtended by its optical disk, the majority of
which are likely to be X-ray binaries associated with the galaxy. By far the
brightest source in the X-ray band is positionally coincident with the nucleus
of the galaxy and is spatially resolved into a component with a radial extent
of ~ 3 kpc plus a point-like core. The broad band (0.1-10 keV) spectrum of this
nuclear source is composed of a hard continuum with a spectral slope
characteristic of that observed in classical Seyfert nuclei (i.e. power-law
photon index, Gamma ~ 1.7), with thermal emission (kT = 0.1-0.6 keV) dominant
below 2 keV. An Fe K alpha line may also be present at ~ 6.8 keV. There is no
evidence for X-ray temporal variability on timescales of hours to years. A
plausible model is that the hard continuum originates in a near-quiescent
active galactic nucleus (with L_x ~ 6 x 10^39 erg/s, 0.5-10 keV) embedded in
the LINER at the centre of NGC 4736. However, an alternative explanation,

Title:The origin of the Narrow Line Region of Mrk 3: an overpressured jet cocoon,"
Abstract:  We have obtained HST FOC long-slit optical spectroscopy of the Narrow Line
Region of the Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 3. In the region cospatial with the
radio-jet the velocity field is highly perturbed and shows two velocity systems
separated by as much as 1700 km/s. We interpret this to be the consequence of
the rapid expansion of a cocoon of hot gas, shocked and heated by the
radio-emitting outflow, which compresses and accelerates the ambient gas. The
NLR itself is essentially a cylindrical shell expanding supersonically. From
the size and velocity of the expanding region, we derive an upper limit to the
radio-source age, ~< 1.5 E5 years, and a lower limit for the jet power, ~> 2
E42 erg/s required to inflate the cocoon and estimate that the jet minimum
advance speed is 3 E-3 pc per year. The total kinetic energy of the high
velocity NLR gas can be estimated as ~6 E54 erg, comparable to the total energy
carried by the jet over its lifetime and this quantitatively supports the idea
that the NLR gas is accelerated by the jet. If the advance speed of Mrk 3 is
representative of the Seyfert population then these sources must also be short
lived and probably recurrent. The jet kinetic luminosity of Mrk 3 is between 2
and 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that derived for radio-loud AGNs with
similar emission-line luminosity. On the other hand, the fraction of jet power
dissipated in radio-emission is similar. We speculate that the main distinction
between radio-quiet and radio-loud AGN is ascribed to a difference in jet power
rather than to a different efficiency in synchrotron emission production.

abundances 12 + log O/H between 7.1 and 8.3. We use the data to determine
abundances for the elements N, O, Ne, S, Ar and Fe. We also analyze Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object Spectrograph archival spectra of 10
supergiant H II regions to derive C and Si abundances in a subsample of 7 BCGs.
The main result of the present study is that none of the heavy
element-to-oxygen abundance ratios studied here (C/O, N/O, Ne/O, Si/O, S/O,
Ar/O, Fe/O) depend on oxygen abundance for BCGs with 12 + log O/H < 7.6 (Z <
Zsun/20). This constancy implies that all these heavy elements have a primary
origin and are produced by the same massive (M > 10Msun) stars responsible for
O production. The dispersion of the C/O and N/O ratios in these galaxies is
found to be remarkably small, being only +/-0.03 dex and +/-0.02 dex
respectively. This very small dispersion is strong evidence against any
time-delayed production of C and primary N in the lowest-metallicity BCGs
(secondary N production is negligible at these low metallicities). The absence
of a time-delayed production of C and N is consistent with the scenario that
galaxies with 12 + log O/H < 7.6 are undergoing now their first burst of star
formation, and that they are therefore young, with ages not exceeding 40 Myr.
If very low metallicities BCGs are indeed young, this would argue against the
commonly held belief that C and N are produced by intermediate-mass (3Msun < M
< 9Msun) stars at very low metallicities, as these stars would not have yet
completed their evolution in these lowest metallicity galaxies.

Title:ASCA Discovery of an X-ray Pulsar in the Error Box of SGR1900+14,"
Abstract:  We present a 2 - 10 keV ASCA observation of the field around the soft gamma
repeater SGR1900+14. One quiescent X-ray source was detected in this
observation, and it was in the SGR error box. In 2 - 10 keV X-rays, its
spectrum may be fit by a power law with index -2.2, and its unabsorbed flux is
9.6 x 10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1. We also find a clear 5.16 s period. The properties
of the three well-studied soft gamma repeaters are remarkably similar to one
another, and provide evidence that all of them are associated with young,
strongly magnetized neutron stars in supernova remnants.

Title:Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission from Starburst Galaxies and M31,"
Abstract:  We present a search for high energy gamma-ray emission from 9 nearby
starburst galaxies and M31 with the EGRET instrument aboard CGRO. Though the
diffuse gamma-ray emission from starburst galaxies was suspected to be
detectable, we find no emission from NGC 253, M82 nor from the average of all 9
galaxies. The 2 sigma upper limit for the EGRET flux above 100 MeV for the
averaged survey observations is 1.8 x 10-8 ph cm-2 s-1. From a model of the
expected radio and gamma-ray emission, we find that the magnetic field in the
nuclei of these galaxies is > 25 micro Gauss, and the ratio of proton and
electron densities is < 400. The EGRET limits indicate that the rate of massive
star formation in the survey galaxies is only about an order of magnitude
higher than in the Milky Way. The upper limit to the gamma-ray flux above 100
MeV for M31 is 1.6 x 10-8 ph cm-2 s-1. At the distance of M31, the Milky Way
flux would be over twice this value, indicating higher gamma-ray emissivities
in our Galaxy. Therefore, since the supernova rate of the Milky Way is higher
than in M31, our null detection of M31 supports the theory of the supernova
origin of cosmic rays in galaxies.

Title:Large Varying Light Velocity as a Solution to the Problems in Cosmology,"
Abstract:  In earlier published work, it was proposed that light speed was larger in the
early universe by 30 orders of magnitude compared to its presently observed
value. This change in the speed of light is associated with a spontaneous
breaking of local Lorentz invariance in the early Universe, associated with a
first order phase transition at a critical time $t=t_c$. This solves the
horizon problem, leads to a mechanism of monopole suppression in cosmology and
can resolve the flatness problem. it also offers the potential of solving the
cosmological constant problem. After the critical time $t_c$, local Lorentz
invariance is restored and light travels at its presently measured speed. We
investigate the field equations in the spontaneously broken phase and study
further the flatness problem and the cosmological constant problem. The entropy
is shown to undergo a large increase as the light velocity goes through a phase
transition. A scale invariant prediction for microwave background fluctuations
originating at the time of the phase transition is discussed.

Abstract:  The nearly face-on spiral galaxy NGC 3938 has been observed in the $H_\alpha$
line with the TAURUS II Fabry-Perot interferometer at the William Herschel
Telescope in order to study the kinematics of the ionized gas. We are able to
construct intensity, velocity and velocity dispersion maps for this galaxy. The
rotation curve of the galaxy is calculated up to 4.5 radial scale lengths from
the galactic centre. The residual velocity field shows very small values with
no systematic pattern. The mean velocity dispersion is approximately constant
with radius at about 11 km/s as previously reported for the neutral and
molecular gas. We have also studied the relation between intensity and velocity
dispersion for the ionized gas. We have found that this distribution is
compatible with a turbulent gas relaxing to a Kolmogorov type turbulence as the
stationary regime. The average dispersion varies with intensity as $\sigma
\propto I^{1/8}$ although it becomes much steeper at higher intensities, for
which the dispersion is kept almost constant at a value of about 19 km/s.

Title:Regular and Chaotic Motion in Globular Clusters,"
Abstract:  As a first step towards a comprehensive investigation of stellar motions
within globular clusters, we present here the results of a study of stellar
orbits in a mildly triaxial globular cluster that follows a circular orbit
inside a galaxy. The stellar orbits were classified using the frequency
analysis code of Carpintero and Aguilar and, as a check, the Liapunov
characteristic exponents were also computed in some cases.
The orbit families were obtained using different start spaces. Chaotic orbits
turn out to be very common and while, as could be expected, they are
particularly abundant in the outer parts of the cluster, they are still
significant in the innermost regions. Their relevance for the structure of the
cluster is discussed.

Title:Group Identification in N-Body Simulations: SKID and DENMAX Versus Friends-of-Friends,"
Abstract:  Three popular algorithms (FOF, DENMAX, and SKID) to identify halos in
cosmological N-body simulations are compared with each other and with the
predicted mass function from Press-Schechter theory. It is shown that the
resulting distribution of halo masses strongly depends upon the choice of free
parameters in the three algorithms, and therefore much care in their choice is
needed. For many parameter values, DENMAX and SKID have the tendency to include
in the halos particles at large distances from the halo center with low
peculiar velocities. FOF does not suffer from this problem, and its mass
distribution furthermore is reproduced well by the prediction from
Press-Schechter theory.

Title:Microlensing in the Small Magellanic Cloud: Lessons from an N-body Simulation,"
Abstract:  We analyse an N-body simulation of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), that of
Gardiner & Noguchi (1996) to determine its microlensing statistics. We find
that the optical depth due to self-lensing in the simulation is low, 0.4 x
10^{-7}, but still consistent (at the 90% level) with that observed by the EROS
and MACHO collaborations. This low optical depth is due to the relatively small
line of sight thickness of the SMC produced in the simulation. The proper
motions and time scales of the simulation are consistent with those observed
assuming a standard mass function for stars in the SMC. The time scale
distribution from the standard mass function generates a significant fraction
of short time scale events: future self-lensing events towards the SMC may have
the same time scales as events observed towards the Large Magellanic CLoud
(LMC). Although some debris was stripped from the SMC during its collision with
the LMC about 2x10^8 yr ago, the optical depth of the LMC due to this debris is
low, a few times 10^{-9}, and thus cannot explain the measured optical depth
towards the LMC.

Title:Models for High-Redshift Lyman Alpha Emitters,"
Abstract:  We present models for dusty high-redshift Lyman alpha emitting galaxies by
combining the Press-Schechter formalism with a treatment of inhomogeneous dust
distribution inside galaxies. These models reproduce the surface density of
emitters inferred from recent observations, and also agree with previous
non-detections. Although a detailed determination of the individual model
parameters is precluded by uncertainties, we find that (i) the dust content of
primordial galaxies builds up in no more than 5x10^8 years, (ii) the galactic
HII regions are inhomogeneous with a cloud covering factor of order unity, and
(iii) the overall star formation efficiency is at least 5 percent. Future
observations should be able to detect Lyman alpha galaxies upto redshifts of
about z=8. If the universe is reionized at z(reion)<8, the corresponding
decline in the number of Lyman alpha emitters at z>z(reion) could prove to be a
useful probe of the reionization epoch.

Title:Caustic Crossing Microlensing Event by Binary MACHOs and Time Scale Bias,"
Abstract:  Caustic crossing microlensing events provide us a unique opportunity to
measure the relative proper motion of the lens to the source, and so those
caused by binary MACHOs are of great importance for understanding the structure
of the Galactic halo and the nature of MACHOs. The microlensing event
98-SMC-01, occurred in June 1998, is the first event for which the proper
motion is ever measured through the caustic crossing, and this event may be
caused by binary MACHOs as we argue in this Letter. Motivated by the possible
existence of binary MACHOs, we have performed the Monte Carlo simulations of
caustic crossing events by binary MACHOs and investigated the properties and
detectability of the events. Our calculation shows that typical caustic
crossing events have the interval between two caustic crossings ($t_{\rm cc}$)
of about 5 days. We argue that with the current strategy of binary event search
the proper motions of these typical events are not measurable because of the
short time scale. Therefore the proper motion distribution measured from
caustic crossing events suffers significantly from {`}time scale bias{'}, which
is a bias toward finding long time scale events and hence slowly moving lenses.
We predict there are two times more short time scale events ($t_{\rm cc}\le 10$
days) than long time scale events ($t_{\rm cc}\ge 10$ days), and propose an
hourly monitoring observation instead of the nightly monitoring currently
undertaken to detect caustic crossing events by binary MACHOs more efficiently.

Title:Millisecond Pulsar Velocities,"
Abstract:  We present improved timing parameters for 13 millisecond pulsars (MSPs)
including 9 new proper motion measurements. These new proper motions bring to
23 the number of MSPs with measured transverse velocities. In light of these
new results we present and compare the kinematic properties of MSPs with those
of ordinary pulsars. The mean transverse velocity of MSPs was found to be
85+/-13 km/s; a value consistent with most models for the origin and evolution
of MSPs and approximately a factor of four lower than that of ordinary pulsars.
We also find that, in contrast to young ordinary pulsars, the vast majority of
which are moving away from the Galactic plane, almost half of the MSPs are
moving towards the plane. This near isotropy would be expected of a population
that has reached dynamic equilibrium. Accurate measurements of MSP velocities
have allowed us to correct their measured spin-down rates for Doppler
acceleration effects, and thereby derive their intrinsic magnetic field
strengths and characteristic ages. We find that close to half of our sample of
MSPs have a characteristic age comparable to or greater than the age of the
Galaxy.

Title:Lyman Break Galaxies at z>4 and the Evolution of the UV Luminosity Density at High Redshift,"
Abstract:  We present initial results of a survey for star-forming galaxies in the
redshift range 3.8 < z < 4.5. This sample consists of a photometric catalog of
244 galaxies culled from a total solid angle of 0.23 square degrees to an
apparent magnitude of I_{AB}=25.0. Spectroscopic redshifts in the range 3.61 <
z < 4.81 have been obtained for 48 of these galaxies; their median redshift is
<z>=4.13. Selecting these galaxies in a manner entirely analogous to our large
survey for Lyman break galaxies at smaller redshift (2.7 < z < 3.4) allows a
relatively clean differential comparison between the populations and integrated
luminosity density at these two cosmic epochs. Over the same range of UV
luminosity, the spectroscopic properties of the galaxy samples at z~4 and z~3
are indistinguishable, as are the luminosity function shapes and the total
integrated UV luminosity densities (rho_{UV}(z=3)/rho_{UV}(z=4) = 1.1 +/-0.3).
We see no evidence at these bright magnitudes for the steep decline in the star
formation density inferred from fainter photometric Lyman-break galaxies in the
Hubble Deep Field (HDF). If the true luminosity density at z~4 is somewhat
higher than implied by the HDF, as our ground-based sample suggests, then the
emissivity of star formation as a function of redshift is essentially constant
for all z>1 once internally consistent corrections for dust are made. This
suggests that there is no obvious peak in star formation activity, and that the
onset of substantial star formation in galaxies occurs at z > 4.5. [abridged

Title:Observations of Galaxy Clustering at High Redshift,"
Abstract:  This paper reviews the current status of measurements of galaxy clustering at
high redshifts (z > 0.3). The focus is on the inherent limitations in the
observation and interpretation of the ``evolution of clustering''. It is likely
that results from the first attempts to characterize galaxy clustering beyond
the ``local'' universe have been significantly limited by sample variance, as
the difficulty in assembling large samples over large volumes is exacerbated as
the observations become more challenging. It is also argued that, because of
the complicated relationship between galaxies and mass (i.e., bias), and the
surprising degeneracies among different popular cosmological models, it is
likely that studies of galaxy clustering as a function of cosmic epoch will
never be useful for strong discrimination between different cosmological
models. On the other hand, observations of galaxy clustering are capable of
testing basic ideas about how (and where) galaxies form. Galaxy formation, as
opposed to cosmography, will probably remain a fundamental question even beyond
the MAP and Planck era.

Title:A persistent ~1 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation in the dipping low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1323-62,"
Abstract:  We have discovered a ~1 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the
persistent-emission, the dips, and the type I X-ray bursts of the low-mass
X-ray binary 4U 1323-62. The rms amplitude of the QPO is approximately 9%, only
weakly depending on photon energy. The amplitude is consistent with being
constant throughout the persistent-emission, the dips and the bursts in all but
one observation, where it is much weaker during one dip. These properties
suggest that we have observed a new type of QPO, which is caused by
quasi-periodic obscuration of the central X-ray source by a structure in the
accretion disk. This can only occur when the binary inclination is high,
consistent with the fact that 4U 1323-62 is a dipping source. The
quasi-periodic obscuration could take place by partial covering of an extended
central X-ray source by a near-opaque medium, or by covering of a point source
by a medium of suitable characteristics to produce the relatively
energy-independent oscillations.

Title:FIR galaxies and the gamma-ray background,"
Abstract:  Contribution to the gamma-ray background (GRB) by galaxies bright in the
far-IR (FIR) is discussed. Using observational correlations between the FIR and
synchrotron emission in radio wavelengths, it is shown that the concentration
of cosmic ray electrons in FIR luminous galaxies is substantially higher than
in the general population of galaxies. Microwave background and intrinsic
galaxy radiation scattered via the inverse Compton (IC) effect by cosmic ray
electrons into high energies makes the FIR galaxies relatively strong gamma-ray
sources (in comparison with normal galaxies).x Using the FIR galaxy luminosity
function and the relationship between FIR and radio luminosities, the
contribution (due to the IC only) of FIR luminous galaxies to the GRB above ~ 1
MeV is estimated at 10 to 25 % depending on the rate of cosmic evolution of
star burst galaxies. This is substantially larger than the normal galaxies
contribution. To obtain more accurate assessment of relationship between the
GRB and FIR galaxies, gamma-ray observations of individual galaxies bright in
the FIR are required.

Title:Radio-Quite Red Quasars,"
Abstract:  We have performed a successful targetted search for a population of red
radio-quiet, and probably absorbed, quasars. Radio-quiet, optically-red ROSAT
PSPC X-ray sources brighter than 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} were searched for
red (O-E > 2.0, O < 20) counterparts in the APM catalog of Palomar Sky Survey
objects. Of 45 objects for which we obtained adequate follow-up optical
spectroscopy, we have found 7 red quasars, 5 with alpha(opt) < -2. Their
redshifts range from 0.06 to 0.31, and their luminosities are moderate, lying
on the Seyfert/Quasar boundary. These red quasars strengthen the case for a
radio-quiet population that is the counterpart of the radio-loud red quasars
found by Smith and Spinrad (1980), and Webster et al. (1995). Unidentified,
fainter, sources could increase the fraction of red quasars by up to a factor
7.
For the red quasars found here, the H-alpha/H-beta ratios, optical slope and
X-ray colors all indicate that they are absorbed by A(V) ~ 2, rather than
having intrinsically red spectra. This amount of obscuration seems to hide
~1-7% of quasars at a given observed flux, or ~3-20% when their fluxes are
corrected to their intrinsic values. This size of population is consistent with
earlier limits, with predicted values from Comastri et al. (1995), and is
comparable to the rate found among radio-loud quasars.
A large population of more heavily absorbed (A(V)=5), fainter, quasars equal
in size to the blue population could exist, without violating existing upper
limits, in accord with the Comastri et al. (1995) predictions.

Title:Testing the FR I/BL Lac unifying model with HST observations,"
Abstract:  Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations provide a novel way of testing
unified models for FR I radio sources and BL Lac objects. The detection of
extended dust discs in some radio galaxies provides information on their jet
orientation. Given this, the strength of the compact nuclear sources of FR I
and BL Lacs can be compared with model predictions. As a pilot project, we
selected five radio galaxies which show extended nuclear discs in the HST
images. The relative orientation of the projected radio-jets and of the
extended nuclear discs indicates that they are not perpendicular, as the
simplest geometrical model would suggest, but that they form an angle of ~ 20 -
40 degrees with the symmetry axis of the disc: a significant change of
orientation occurs between the innermost AGN structure and the kpc-scale.
Nevertheless, the discs appear to be useful indicators of the radio sources
orientation since the angles formed by the disc axis and the jet with the line
of sight differ by only ~ 10 - 20 degrees. At the center of each disc an
unresolved nuclear source is present. We compared its luminosity with the
optical core luminosity of BL Lacs selected for having similar host galaxy
magnitude and extended radio luminosity. The BL Lac cores are between 2 E2 and
3 E5 times brighter than the corresponding radio galaxies ones. The FR I/BL Lac
core luminosity ratio shows a suggestive correlation with the orientation of
the radio galaxies with respect to the line of sight. The behavior of this
ratio is quantitatively consistent with a scenario in which the emission in the
FR I and BL Lac is dominated by the beamed radiation from a relativistic jet
with Doppler factor ~ 5 - 10, thus supporting the basic features of the
proposed unification schemes.

Title:Enrichment of the Intracluster Medium,"
Abstract:  The relevance of galaxies of different luminosity and mass for the chemical
enrichment of the intracluster medium (ICM) is analysed. For this purpose, I
adopt the composite luminosity function of cluster galaxies from Trentham
(1998), which exhibits a significant rise at the very faint end. The model -
adopting a universal Salpeter IMF - is calibrated on reproducing the
M_Fe/L_tot, M_Fe/M_*, and alpha/Fe ratios observed in clusters. Although the
contribution to total luminosity and ICM metals peaks around L* galaxies (M*
approx -20), faint objects with M_B>-18 still provide at least 30 per cent of
the metals present in the ICM. In consistency with the solar alpha/Fe ratios
determined by {ASCA}, the model predicts that 60 per cent of the ICM iron comes
from Type Ia supernovae. The predicted slope of the relation between
intracluster gas mass and cluster luminosity emerges shallower than the
observed one, indicating that the fraction of primordial gas increases with
cluster richness.

Title:Cold Flows and Large Scale Tides,"
Abstract:  Several studies have indicated that the local cosmic velocity field is rather
cold, in particular in the regions outside the massive, virialized clusters of
galaxies. If our local cosmic environment is taken to be a representative
volume of the Universe, the repercussion of this finding is that either we live
in a low-$\Omega$ Universe and/or that the galaxy distribution is a biased
reflection of the underlying mass distribution. Otherwise, the pronounced
nature of the observed galaxy distribution would be irreconcilable with the
relatively quiet flow of the galaxies.
Here we propose a different view on this cosmic dilemma, stressing the fact
that our cosmic neighbourhood embodies a region of rather particular dynamical
properties, and henceforth we are apt to infer flawed conclusions with respect
to the global Universe. Suspended between two huge mass concentrations, the
Great Attractor region and the Perseus-Pisces chain, we find ourselves in a
region of relatively low density yet with a very strong tidal shear. This tidal
field induces a local velocity field with a significant large-scale bulk flow
but a low small-scale velocity dispersion. By means of constrained realizations
of our local Universe, consisting of Wiener-filtered reconstructions inferred
from the Mark III catalogue of galaxy peculiar velocities in combination with
appropriate spectrally determined fluctuations, we study the implications for
our local velocity field. We find that we live near a local peak in the
distribution of the cosmic Mach number, $|v_{bulk}|/\sigma_v$, and that our
local cosmic niche is located in the tail of the Mach number distribution
function.

it could have originated from a proto-planetary disc which has been dissipated.

convectcion is treated within the formalism of the full spectrum turbulence
theory. The set of models presented here is very detailed and should be
valuable for the interpretation of the observational data on low - mass WDs
recently discovered in numerous binary configurations and also for the general
problem of determining the theoretical luminosity function for WDs. In this
context, we compare our cooling sequences with the observed WD luminosity
function recently improved by Leggett, Ruiz and Bergeron (1998) and we obtain
an age for the Galactic disc of approximately 8 Gyr. Finally, we applied the
results of this paper to derive stellar masses of a sample of low - mass white
dwarfs.

Title:Computation of Mass Outflow Rate from Relativistic Quasi-Spherical Accretion onto Black Holes,"
Abstract:  We compute mass outflow rate $R_{\dot m}$ from relativistic matter accreting
quasi-spherically onto Schwarzschild black holes. Taking the pair-plasma
pressure mediated shock surface as the {\it effective} boundary layer (of the
black hole) from where bulk of the outflow is assumed to be generated,
computation of this rate is done using combinations of exact transonic inflow
and outflow solutions. We find that $R_{\dot m}$ depends on the initial
parameters of the flow, the polytropic index of matter, the degree of
compression of matter near the shock surface and on the location of the shock
surface itself. We thus not only study the variation of the mass outflow rate
as a function of various physical parameters governing the problem but also
provide a sufficiently plausible estimation of this rate.

"Title:Elliptical Galaxies: Detailed Structure, Scaling Relations and Formation","
Abstract:  The last decade of research on elliptical galaxies has produced a wealth of
new information concerning both their detailed structure and their global
scaling relations. We review the old and new results about isophote shapes and
subcomponents (Sect. 1), scaling relations of global parameters and redshift
evolution (Sect. 2), and the ages, metallicities (Sect. 3) and abundance ratios
(Sect. 4). Finally, we confront the observations with hierarchical formation
scenarios of elliptical galaxies (Sect. 5). The picture emerging from this
variety of observational evidence is broadly consistent with the merging
scenario of hierarchical structure formation models, but the stellar population
properties of ellipticals pose some challanges. The formation of ellipticals
must have always involved some dissipation. The gas fraction at the last major
merger event presumably has strong influence on their present day properties.
Most elliptical galaxies are old systems, but disky ellipticals might be
younger than boxy objects and have more extended star formation histories. The
small scatter and the redshift variations of the scaling relation are
compatible with passive evolution. The high Mg/Fe overabundances of luminous
(boxy) ellipticals point to a rapid star formation episode, while
low-luminosity objects have values of Mg/Fe nearly solar, allowing for an
extended star formation history.

Title:Novae Crossing the Thermal Stability Line,"
Abstract:  A method, based on the disc instability model, for testing the thermal
stability of Cataclysmic Variables (CVs), is presented. It is shown that the
border line between thermal stability and instability is crossed during some
nova outbursts and decays, however it is not clear whether this is the general
behaviour. We suggest two new evolutionary scenarios for short orbital period
CVs. One of them is the analogy for the 'modified hibernation scenario' and the
other is an extension of the ideas of Mukai and Naylor (1993) for long orbital
period CVs. We conclude that the observations have not favoured one of the two
models. Finally, we speculate the existence of a new type of nova - an AM CVn
like nova.

Title:On accretion flow in Soft X-ray Transients,"
Abstract:  We have analyzed archival Ginga data of a number of Soft X-ray Transient
sources and modelled them in an attempt to constrain the geometry and physical
properties of accretion. Our models include a self-consistent description of
X-ray reprocessing, linking the properties of the reflected continuum and those
of the iron fluorescence K\alpha line, and allowing for relativistic smearing
of spectral features. We derive constraints on the inner extent of the disk and
its ionization, assuming a generic geometry of a central X-ray source and an
external accretion disk.
Fitting our models to the data we have found that in some sources - GS
1124-68 (Nova Muscae 1991) and GS 2000+25 - the evolution during decline
proceeded in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical models based on
advection-dominated solutions of accretion flow. These models link the
high/soft-low/hard transition with a change of geometry, most importantly, the
inner radius of the optically thick disk. Quantitatively, our analysis requires
serious revision of the model assumptions.
A remarkably exceptional case is that of GS 2023+338, where the source
behavior both during outburst and decline was quite different than the other,
more ``standard'' ones. However, we found that the source did go into the
high/soft state, contrary to claims in literature.

Title:The effect of non-radial motions on the CDM model predictions,"
Abstract:  In this paper we show how non-radial motions, originating from the tidal
interaction of the irregular mass distribution within and around protoclusters,
can solve some of the problems of the CDM model. Firstly the discrepancy
between the CDM predicted two-points correlation function of clusters and the
observed one. We compare the two-points correlation function, that we obtain
taking account of non-radial motions, with that obtained by Sutherland &
Efstathiou (1991) from the analysis of Geller & Hucra's (1988) deep redshift
survey and with the data points for the APM clusters obtained by Efstathiou et
al. (1992). Secondly the problem of the X-ray clusters abundance
over-production predicted by the CDM model. In this case we compare the X-ray
temperature distribution function, calculated using Press-Schechter theory and
Evrard's (1990) prescriptions for the mass-temperature relation, taking also
account of the non-radial motions, with Henry & Arnaud (1991) and Edge et al.
(1990) X-ray temperature distributions for local clusters. We find that in both
cases the model is in good agreement with experimental data. Finally we
calculate the bias coefficient using a selection function that takes into
account the effects of non-radial motions, and we show that the bias so
obtained can account for a substantial part of the total bias required by
observations on cluster scales.

Title:Primordial Black Holes With Variable Gravity,"
Abstract:  We have studied the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a universe
with a variable gravitational constant and bulk viscosity. We have found that
the strength of gravity has changed appreciably in the early universe. The
gravitational constant attained its greatest value at t=10^{-23} sec after the
Big Bang. PBHs formed at the GUT and electroweak epochs would have masses about
$1.85\times 10^9 g$ and $1.8\times 10^{-7} g$ respectively. Their temperatures
when they explode are $6\times 10^8K$ and 6 K respectively. PBHs formed during
nuclear epoch are hard to detect at the present time. The gravitational
constant ($G$) is found to increase as $G\propto t^2$ in the radiation epoch.
The gamma rays bursts (GRBs) may have their origin in the evaporation of the
PBHs formed during GUT time.

Abstract:  We use detailed modeling of stellar populations of nearby galaxies to
calculate population parameters. Our sample of galaxies includes most galaxies

sufficient to decompose galaxies into the nucleus, the metal rich core, the
bulge, the halo, the young and old disks, and the dark halo. We compare
mass-to-luminosity ratios and colors of bulges, disks and halos with results of
models of galactic chemical evolution. The luminosity weighted mean of the
mass-to-luminosity ratio of visible stellar population is M/L_B = 4 +- 1.4 in
solar units. This ratio is surprisingly constant for galaxies of very different
absolute magnitude.

Title:Kinematically Lopsided Spiral Galaxies,"
Abstract:  Asymmetries in the distribution of light and neutral hydrogen are often
observed in spiral galaxies. Here, attention is drawn to the presence of
large-scale asymmetries in their kinematics. Two examples of kinematically
lopsided galaxies are presented and discussed. The shape of the rotation curve
--rising more steeply on one side of the galaxy than on the other-- is the
signature of the kinematic lopsidedness. It is shown that kinematic
lopsidedness may be related to lopsidedness in the potential, and that even a
mild perturbation in the latter can produce significant kinematical effects.
Probably at least half of all spiral galaxies are lopsided.

Title:A new radio double lens from CLASS: B1127+385,"
Abstract:  We present the discovery of a new gravitational lens system with two compact
radio images separated by 0.701+-0.001 arcsec. The lens system was discovered
in the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey (CLASS) as a flat spectrum radio source. Both
radio components show structure in a VLBA 8.4 GHz radio image. No further
extended structure is seen in either the VLA, MERLIN or VLBA images. Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 images in F555W and F814W show two extended objects
close to the radio components, which we identify as two lens galaxies. Their
colours and mass-to-light ratios seem to favour two late-type spiral galaxies
at relatively high redshifts (z_d>~0.5). Faint emission is also detected at
positions corresponding to the radio images.
A two-lens mass model can explain the observed VLBA structure. The best fit
model has a reduced chi^2 of 1.1. The relative positions of the VLBA
subcomponents are reproduced within 0.08 mas, the flux density ratios within
0.19. We also reproduce the position angle and separation of the two VLBA
subcomponents in A and B within the observational errors, which we consider
strong evidence for the validity of the lens model. Moreover, we find a surface
density axis ratio of 0.74^{+0.10}_{-0.12} for the primary lens (G1),
consistent with the surface brightness axis ratio of 0.69+-0.15. Also, the
surface density position angle of 4.9^{+28.2}_{-22.4} degree of G1 compares
well with the -6+-13 degree position angle of the surface brightness
distribution. The errors indicate the 99 per cent confidence interval.

"Title:Theoretical aspects of the inverse Tully-Fisher relation as a distance indicator: incompleteness in log(V_Max), the relevant slope, and the calibrator sample bias","
Abstract:  We study the influence of the assumption behind the use of the inverse
Tully-Fisher relation: that there should be no observational cutoffs in the TF
parameter log(V_M). It is noted how lower and upper cutoffs would be seen in a
log(H_0) vs. ``normalized distance'' diagram. Analytical expressions, under the
simplifying assumption of a normal distribution and the use of the correct TF
slope, are derived for the resulting biases, especially the average bias which
log(V_M) cutoffs produce in the derived value of H_0. This bias is shown to be
relatively weak, and as such cannot explain the large differences in the
reported values of H_0 derived from direct and inverse TF relations.
Some problems of slope and calibration are shown to be more serious. In
particular, one consequence of fitting through the calibrators either the slope
relevant for field galaxies or the steeper slope followed by calibrators is
that the derived value of the Hubble constant comes to depend on the nature of
the calibrator sample. If the calibrator sample is not representative of the
cosmic distribution of log(V_M), large errors in the derived value of H_0 are
possible. Analytical expressions are given for this error that we term the
calibrator sample bias.

Abstract:  We present H-alpha and red continuum observations for a sample of late-type
low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf irregular galaxies(DIGs), consisting of all
the m_B<17.2 ImIV and V galaxies in the Virgo cluster (VC), and compare them
with a representative sample of VC high surface brightness (HSB) DIGs. Line
fluxes and equivalent widths are listed for individual HII regions and total
H-alpha emission is measured for the entire DIG. The HII regions we identified
do not produce all the line emission. For LSBs with line emission we find star
formation rates (SFR) of 6.9-43.0 10^{-3} M_sol/yr, ~10x weaker than for HSB
objects. About 2 HII regions are detected per LSB galaxy; they are smaller and
fainter than in HSB galaxies in the VC, have line equivalent widths ~50% of
those in HSBs, and cover similar fractions of the galaxies. The line-emitting
regions of LSB galaxies are preferentially located at the periphery of a
galaxy, while in HSBs they tend to be central. The line strength of an HII
region is correlated with the red continuum light underneath the region. No
fundamental differences were identified in the star formation properties of the
LSB and HSB dwarf galaxies we studied and infer that these galaxies must be
similar, with the difference being the intensity of the present star-formation
burst.

Title:3D Simulation of the Gas Dynamics in the Central Parsec of the Galaxy,"
Abstract:  It is thought that many characteristics of the gaseous features within the
central parsec of our Galaxy, are associated with the accretion of ambient
plasma by a central concentration of mass. Using a 3D hydrodynamical code, we
have been simulating this process in order to realistically model the gaseous
flows in the center of our Galaxy. In the most recent simulation, we have taken
into account the multi-point-like distribution of stellar wind sources, as well
as the magnetic heating and radiative cooling of these stellar winds. As
expected, we find that the structure of the flow is significantly different
from that due to a uniform medium. We also investigate the possibility that Sgr
A* is due to a distributed mass concentration instead of the canonical point
mass of a black hole. We discuss the physical state of the accreting gas and
how our results suggest that Sgr A* is unlikely to be associated with a ``dark
cluster''.

IRAS 1.2 Jy surveys is flatter around the maximum. Power spectra of galaxies
and matter are similar in shape, we find the bias parameter of galaxies

Title:One Loop Back Reaction On Chaotic Inflation,"
Abstract:  We extend, for the case of a general scalar potential, the inflaton-graviton
Feynman rules recently developed by Iliopoulos {\it et al.} As an application
we compute the leading term, for late co-moving times, of the one loop back
reaction on the expansion rate for $V(\phi) = \frac12 m^2 \phi^2$. This is
expressed as the logarithmic time derivative of the scale factor in the
coordinate system for which the expectation value of the metric has the form:
$<0 | g_{\mu\nu}({\bar t},{\vec x}) | 0 > dx^{\mu} dx^{\nu} = - d{\bar t}^2 +
a^2({\bar t}) d{\vec x} \cdot d{\vec x}$. This quantity should be a gauge
independent observable. Our result for it agrees exactly with that inferred
from the effect previously computed by Mukhanov {\it et al.} using canonical
quantization. It is significant that the two calculations were made with
completely different schemes for fixing the gauge, and that our computation was
done using the standard formalism of covariant quantization. This should settle
some of the issues recently raised by Unruh.

Abstract:  We consider quantum mechanical corrections to a homogeneous, isotropic and

power of the co-moving time. The effects of both gravitons and the scalar
inflaton are computed at one loop using the manifestly causal formalism of
Schwinger with the Feynman rules recently developed by Iliopoulos {\it et al.}
We find no significant effect, in marked contrast with the result obtained by
Mukhanov {\it et al.} for chaotic inflation based on a quadratic potential. By
applying the canonical technique of Mukhanov {\it et al.} to the exponential
potentials of power law inflation, we show that the two methods produce the
same results, within the approximations employed, for these backgrounds. We
therefore conclude that the shape of the inflaton potential can have an
enormous impact on the one loop back-reaction.

We show that neutral hydrogen clouds are associated with soft X-ray emission,

clouds (HVCs), are located partly within the galactic halo, and partly in
intergalactic space. The ROSAT detection of soft X-ray emission from some of

Title:Observational consequences of baryonic gaseous dark matter,"
Abstract:  Possible observational consequences of dark matter in the Galaxy in the form
of dense molecular gas clouds - clumpuscules of masses $M_c\sim 10^{-3} \msun$
and radii $R_c\sim 3\times 10^{13}$ cm - are considered. Recent models of the
extreme scattering events - refraction of radio-waves from quasars in dense
plasma clumps in the Galactic halo - definitely show on such clouds as possible
dark matter candidate. We argue that collisions of such clumpuscules are quite
frequent: around $1-10 \msun$ a year can be ejected in the interstellar medium
due to collisions. Optical continuum and 21 cm emissions from post-collisional
gas are found to be observable. We show that clumpuscules can form around O
stars HII regions of sizes $R\sim 30$ pc and emission measure $EM\simeq 20
cm^{-6}$ pc, and can also be observable in $H_\alpha$ emission. Evaporation of
clumpuscules by external ionizing radiation can be a substantial mass source.
From requirement that the total mass input on the Hubble time cannot exceed
the luminous mass in the Galaxy, typical radius of clouds is constrained as
$R_c < 3.5\times 10^{12}$ cm, and their contribution to surface mass density as
50 $\msun pc^{-2}$. It is argued that dissipation of kinetic energy of the gas
ejected by such clouds can be an efficient energy source for the Galactic halo.

Abstract:  We study the hypothesis that high-velocity clouds (HVCs) may originate from
instabilities within the gaseous phase of the Galactic halo. According to the
hydrostatic equilibrium model of Kalberla & Kerp (1998), we determine the
probability distribution of occurrence of instabilities within the Galactic
halo. Instabilities may produce condensations within the Galactic halo beyond a
z-distances of 4 kpc, which are accelerated by gravity and decelerated by
drag-forces. We present evidence that the HI high-velocity dispersion
component, discovered by Kalberla et al. (1998) is associated with
high-velocity-halo gas. The physical properties of this high-velocity-halo gas
are similar to the recently detected highly-ionized HVCs by Sembach et al.
(1995, 1998). Accordingly, the HI high-velocity dispersion component may be the
neutral tracer of the turbulent gas motions within the Galactic halo. Our
calculations demonstrate, that the sky-averaged signal of in-falling
condensations does not differ significantly from the HI emission of the
turbulent Galactic halo gas.

with the PCA and HEXTE experiments onboard the RXTE on November 1996 for about
100 ksec. The broad band spectral capability and sensitivity of RXTE enables us
to study simultaneously the X-ray (2-20 keV) and hard X-ray components (E>20
keV) of this source. During the observation, this ``Atoll'' source was in its
``Island'' state characterized by a hard Comptomized spectrum with an electron

excess which we fit with a blackbody of kTbb=0.7 keV. The Comptonization
temperature is significantly lower those observed for black holes candidates in
their low luminosity states (kTe >~ 50 keV). Finally, our observation allows us
to associate the presence of an hard tail with a low luminosity X-ray state

hydrostatic equilibrium model of the Milky Way and the recent all-sky survey
data rangeing from the gamma-ray to the radio regime. On large scales the
galactic disk-halo system is found to be stable against Parker-instabilities.
Pressure support from the Galactic disk is essential to stabilise the halo. In
particular the diffuse ionised gas layer acts as a disk-halo interface.
Assuming that the distribution of the soft X-ray emitting plasma traces the
gravitational potential, we derived the dark matter content of the Milky Way to
be about M ~ 2.8 10^11 M_o. Our findings are consistent with the rotation curve

of sky, where we have selected a sample of IRAS sources with 60 micron flux
densities greater than 0.2 Jy, corresponding to a redshift limit z~1 for
objects with far-IR luminosities of 10^{13} L_sun. Optical identifications for
these were obtained from the UK Schmidt Telescope plates, using the likelihood
ratio method. Optical spectroscopy has been carried out to reliably identify
and measure the redshifts of six objects with very faint optical counterparts,
which are the only objects with R>100 in the sample. One object is a
hyperluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIG) at z=0.834. Of the remaining, fainter
objects, five are ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs) with a mean redshift
of 0.45, higher than the highest known redshift of any non-hyperluminous ULIG
prior to this study. High excitation lines reveal the presence of an active
nucleus in the HyLIG, just as in the other known infrared-selected HyLIGs. In
contrast, no high excitation lines are found in the non-hyperluminous ULIGs. We
discuss the implications of our results for the number density of HyLIGs at z<1
and for the evolution of the infrared galaxy population out to this redshift,
and show that substantial evolution is indicated. Our selection method is
robust against the presence of gravitational lensing if the optical and
infrared magnification factors are similar, and we suggest a way of using it to
select candidate gravitationally lensed infrared galaxies.

Title:Super-Eddington accretion in GRS 1915+105,"
Abstract:  Classical modelling suggests that, during the RXTE observations studied, GRS
1915+105 was near or above the critical accretion rate and the optically thick
inner disk penetrated inside the advection-dominated flow. The system was very
unstable leading to a rich pattern of variability, e.g. the Rings which might
be characteristic to disk instabilities very close to the innermost stable
orbit (Vilhu and Nevalainen, 1998, ApJ 508, L85). Small values of R_in obtained
require a rapidly rotating Kerr hole, unless the central mass is smaller than
2-3 solar masses. A thermal sombrero provides a reasonable modelling of the
rings, although the broad-band RXTE/OSSE spectrum analysed seems to require a
significant injection of relativistic electrons, the hot phase being not a pure
thermal one. Observations below 2 keV and simultaneous broad-band spectra
between 2--400 keV are needed to better fix the size of the black body disk and
the role of relativistic injection. Further, theoretical work on emerging
spectra of Kerr-holes is required to replace the classical model used.

metallicities is presented. This was constructed by combining Hipparcos
parallaxes ond proper motions with radial velocities and metallicities from
Carney et al. (1994; CLLA). The accurate Hipparcos parallaxes lead to an -
upward - correction factor of 11% of the photometric distance scale of CLLA.
The kinematical behaviour of the subdwarfs is discussed in particular in
relation to their metallicities. Most of the stars turn out to be thick disk
stars, but the sample contains also many genuine halo stars. While the extreme
metal poor halo does not rotate, a population of subdwarfs with metallicities
in the range -1.6 < [Fe/H] < -1.0 dex appears to rotate around the galactic
center with a mean rotation speed of about 100 km/s.

"Title:A giant, periodic flare from the soft gamma repeater SGR1900+14","
Abstract:  Soft gamma repeaters are high-energy transient sources associated with
neutron stars in young supernova remnants. They emit sporadic, short (~ 0.1 s)
bursts with soft energy spectra during periods of intense activity. The event
of March 5, 1979 was the most intense and the only clearly periodic one to
date. Here we report on an even more intense burst on August 27, 1998, from a
different soft gamma repeater, which displayed a hard energy spectrum at its
peak, and was followed by a ~300 s long tail with a soft energy spectrum and a
dramatic 5.16 s period. Its peak and time integrated energy fluxes at Earth are
the largest yet observed from any cosmic source. This event was probably
initiated by a massive disruption of the neutron star crust, followed by an
outflow of energetic particles rotating with the period of the star. Comparison
of these two bursts supports the idea that magnetic energy plays an important
role, and that such giant flares, while rare, are not unique, and may occur at
any time in the neutron star's activity cycle.

Title:The AGILE Contribution To AGNs Studies,"
Abstract:  The AGILE $\gamma$-ray telescope (Tavani et al. 1998) will have a relatively
uniform sensitivity over a very wide field of view. This allows to
simultaneously monitor several AGN's and to react quickly with multiwavelength
observations in the case of flaring activity. The large cumulative sky coverage
will also lead to a significant increase in the number of $\gamma$-ray emitting
AGN's known at the end of the mission.

Title:Cosmology Solved?,"
Abstract:  For two decades the hot big-bang model as been referred to as the standard
cosmology -- and for good reason. For just as long cosmologists have known that
there are fundamental questions that are not answered by the standard cosmology
and point to a grander theory. The best candidate for that grander theory is
inflation + cold dark matter; it can extend our understanding of the Universe
back to 10^-32 sec. There is now prima facie evidence for the two basic tenets
of this new paradigm: flat Universe and scale-invariant spectrum of Gaussian
density perturbations, and an avalanche of telling cosmological observations is
coming. If inflation + cold dark matter is correct, then there are new,
fundamental questions to be answered, most notably the nature of the dark
energy that seems to account for 60% of the critical density and how inflation
fits into a unified theory of the forces and particles. These are exciting
times in cosmology!

Title:Cosmological Parameters from Statistics of Strongly Lensed Radio Sources,"
Abstract:  We calculate the expected number of strongly lensed radio sources in a sample
of 6500 sources observed with the Very Large Array as part of the Cosmic Lens
All Sky Survey (CLASS) during the first two sessions of its observations. A
comparison between the predicted and the observed number of lensed radio
sources allows a determination of the current value of Omega-Lambda. If there
are six strongly lensed sources in this sample, our 95% confidence upper limit
on Lambda in a flat universe is 0.79. Instead of considering a simple
cosmological constant, we also consider the possibility of a quintessence
scalar field responsible for the additional energy density of the universe. We
present our constraints on the Omega_x-w plane. We discuss the region allowed
by combined gravitational lensing statistics, high redshift Type Ia supernovae
distances, and globular cluster ages.
Instead of a cosmological model, we can constrain the redshift distribution
of faint radio sources based on the observed gravitational lensing rate and an
assumed cosmological model. If there are six strongly lensed sources, the 68%
confidence upper limit on the average redshift of radio sources with flux
densities less than 150 mJy at 8.4 GHz is <z> < 1.4 + (Omega-Lambda) \pm 0.1.
In order to obtain a much tighter estimate on the cosmological parameters, it
is essential that the redshift distribution for radio sources at the faint flux
density levels be observationally determined. We strongly recommend that
statistically complete optical spectroscopic programs be carried out to obtain
redshifts for a representative subsample of faint background radio sources.

Title:1996/1997 low luminosity state and state transitions of GRS1915+105: RXTE observations,"
Abstract:  The results of X-ray observations of Galactic superluminal jet source GRS
1915+105 during its low luminosity state and state transitions in October, 1996
- April, 1997 with PCA and HEXTE instruments aboard Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) are reported. Except some peculiarities, the major spectral and temporal
properties of the source during this period were similar to that of the
Galactic black hole candidates in the intermediate state (corresponding to the
transition between the canonical high and low states). The power law component
of the spectrum gradually hardens with decrease of the source flux in the 3 -
150 keV energy band. The 2 - 10 Hz QPOs were found to be a generic feature of
the power density spectrum in this state. The changes of the QPO centroid
frequency are strongly correlated with the changes of spectral and timing
parameters (in particular parameters of the soft spectral component). This type
of correlation holds on the wide range of time scales (from seconds to months).
Overall trend of the spectral and temporal properties suggests that with
further drop of the source flux (below the values observed during the reported
period) they would match the canonical values for a low state of the Galactic
black hole candidates.

Title:Galaxy destruction and diffuse light in clusters,"
Abstract:  Deep images of the Centaurus and Coma clusters reveal two spectacular arcs of
diffuse light that stretch for over 100 kpc, yet are just a few kpc wide. At a
surface brightness of m_b \sim 27-28th arcsec^-2, the Centaurus arc is the most
striking example known of structure in the diffuse light component of a rich
galaxy cluster. We use numerical simulations to show that the Centaurus feature
can be reproduced by the tidal debris of a spiral galaxy that has been tidally
disrupted by the gravitational potential of NGC 4709. The surface brightness
and narrow dimensions of the diffuse light suggest that the disk was
co-rotating with its orbital path past pericentre. Features this prominent in
clusters will be relatively rare, although at fainter surface brightness levels
the diffuse light will reveal a wealth of structure. Deeper imaging surveys may
be able to trace this feature for several times its presently observed extent
and somewhere along the tidal debris, a fraction of the original stellar
component of the disk will remain bound, but transformed into a faint
spheroidal galaxy. It should be possible to confirm the galactic origin of the
Centaurus arc by observing planetary nebulae along its length with redshifts
close to that of NGC 4709.

Abstract:  We examine the recent claims that cosmic gamma-ray bursts are associated with

positional coincidences between cataloged quasars or Abell clusters, and
selected events from the BATSE 3B catalog of gamma-ray bursts. We use a larger
sample of gamma-ray bursts with more accurate positions, obtained by the 3rd
Interplanetary Network, to re-evaluate these possible associations. We find no

"Title:Optical and UV observations of a strong flare in the young, single K2-dwarf LQ Hya","
Abstract:  We present high resolution optical echelle spectra and IUE observations
during a strong flare on 1993 December 22 in the very active, young, rapidly
rotating, single K2 dwarf LQ Hya. The initial impulsive phase of the flare,
which started sometime between 2:42 UT and 4:07 UT, was characterized by strong
optical continuum enhancement and blue-shifted emission lines with broad wings.
The optical chromospheric lines reached their maximum intensity at
$\approx$5:31 UT, by which time the blue-shift vanished and the optical
continuum enhancement had sharply decreased. Thereafter, the line emission
slowly decreased and the lines red-shift in a gradual phase that lasted at
least two more hours. The Mg II lines behaved similarly. Quiescent C IV flux
levels were not recovered until 21 hours later, though a data gap and a
possible second flare make the interpretation uncertain. In addition to the
typically flare-enhanced emission lines (e.g., H_alpha and H_beta), we observe
He I D_3 going into emission, plus excess emission (after subtraction of the
quiescent spectrum) in other He I and several strong neutral metal lines (e.g.,
Mg I b). Flare enhancement of the far UV continuum generally agrees with a Si I
recombination model. We estimate the total flare energy, and discuss the broad
components, asymmetries, and Doppler shifts seen in some of the emission lines.

Title:Faint Gigahertz peaked spectrum sources and the evolution of young radio sources,"
Abstract:  GPS sources are the objects of choice to study the initial evolution of
extragalactic radio sources, since it is most likely that they are the young
counterparts of large scale radio sources. Correlations found between their
peak frequency, peak flux density and angular size provide strong evidence that
synchrotron self absorption is the cause of the spectral turnovers, and
indicate that young radio sources evolve in a self-similar way. The difference
in redshift distribution between young and old radio sources must be due to a
difference in slope of their luminosity functions, and we argue that this slope
is strongly affected by the luminosity evolution of the individual sources. A
luminosity evolution scenario is proposed in which GPS sources increase in
luminosity and large scale radio sources decrease in luminosity with time. It
is shown that such a scenario agrees with the local luminosity function of GPS
galaxies.

Title:Dark Matter and Dark Energy in the Universe,"
Abstract:  For the first time, we have a plausible, complete accounting of matter and
energy in the Universe. Expressed a fraction of the critical density it goes
like this: neutrinos, between 0.3% and 15%; stars, 0.5%; baryons (total), 5%;
matter (total), 40%; smooth, dark energy, 60%; adding up to the critical
density. This accounting is consistent with the inflationary prediction of a
flat Universe and defines three dark-matter problems: Where are the dark
baryons? What is the nonbaryonic dark matter? What is the nature of the dark
energy? The leading candidate for the (optically) dark baryons is diffuse hot
gas; the leading candidates for the nonbaryonic dark matter are slowly moving
elementary particles left over from the earliest moments (cold dark matter),
such as axions or neutralinos; the leading candidates for the dark energy
involve fundamental physics and include a cosmological constant (vacuum
energy), a rolling scalar field (quintessence), and light, frustrated
topological defects.

Title:The optical/IR counterpart of the 3 July 1998 gamma-ray burst and its evolution,"
Abstract:  We imaged the X-ray error box of GRB 980703, beginning 22.5 hours after the
gamma--ray event, in both the optical R and near-infrared H bands. A fading
optical/IR object was detected within the X-ray error box, coincident with the
variable radio source reported by Frail et al. (1998a), who also detected the
optical transient independently of us. Further imagery revealed the GRB host
galaxy, with R = 22.49 +/- 0.04 and H = 20.5 +/- 0.25, the brightest so far
detected. When excluding its contribution to the total flux, both the R and
H-band light curves are well-fit by a power-law decay with index alpha~1.4. Our
data suggest an intrinsic column density in the host galaxy of ~ 3.5 x 10^21
cm^-2 which indicates the existence of a dense and rich-gas medium in which the
GRB occurred, thus supporting the hypernova model scenarios.

Title:An Asca Study of the Supernova Remnant G39.2-0.3,"
Abstract:  We present the analysis of archival data from the Advanced Satellite for
Cosmology and Astrophysics} (ASCA) of the supernova remnant (SNR) G39.2-0.3.
G39.2-0.3 has been sometimes characterized as a shell-like remnant in the
literature but our high-energy imaging and spectral analysis show the
unambiguous composite nature of the remnant. We find that part of the
contribution to G39.2-0.3's X-ray emission is distinctly non-thermal, best
described by a power law with a photon index ($2.53^{\rm +0.34}_{\rm -0.27}$).
The region of emission is consistent with a point source (extension consistent
with the point spread function of the detector at the off-axis angle of the
observation) and is roughly defined by a circle of radius of about 4 arcmin. A
second contribution comes from a thermal component which contributes flux
primarily at low energies. Despite the absence of any pulsed emission detected
from the compact source, we argue that the emission is most probably due to a
rotating compact object that is powering the detected synchrotron nebula within
the SNR. \\

Title:On Deep-Ocean Fe-60 as a Fossil of a Near-Earth Supernova,"
Abstract:  Live $^{60}$Fe has recently been reported in a deep-ocean ferromanganese
crust. Analysis of the isotopic ratios in the sample suggests that the measured
$^{60}$Fe abundance exceeds the levels generated by terrestrial and cosmogenic
sources, and it has been proposed that the excess of $^{60}$Fe is a signature
of a supernova that exploded near the earth several Myr ago. In this paper, we
consider the possible background sources, and confirm that the measured
$^{60}$Fe is significantly higher than all known backgrounds, in contrast with
the reported abundance of live $^{53}$Mn. We discuss scenarios in which the
data are consistent with a supernova event at a distance $D \sim 30$ pc and an
epoch $t_{\rm SN} \sim 5$ Myr ago. We propose tests that could confirm or
refute the interpretation of the $^{60}$Fe discovery, including searches for
$^{10}$Be, $^{129}$I and $^{146}$Sm. Such a nearby supernova event might have
had some impact on the earth's biosphere, principally by enhancing the
cosmic-ray flux. This might have damaged the earth's ozone layer, enhancing the
penetration of solar ultraviolet radiation. In this connection, we comment on
the Middle Miocene and Pliocene mini-extinction events. We also speculate on
the possibility of a supernova-induced ""cosmic-ray winter,"" if cosmic rays play
a significant role in seeding cloud formation.

Title:Weak Gravitational Lensing by Voids,"
Abstract:  We consider the prospects for detecting weak gravitational lensing by

basic expressions for magnification and distortion by spherical voids.
Clustering of the background sources and cosmic variance are the main factors
which limit in principle the detection of lensing by voids. We conclude that
only voids with radii larger than $\sim 100$ \hm have lensing signal to noise
larger than unity.

Title:A Review of Line and Continuum Correlations in AGNs,"
Abstract:  This review addresses the current observational status of the Baldwin Effect
(BE), an empirical anti-correlation between emission line equivalent width and
source luminosity for active galactic nuclei. We provide a brief history of the
BE, and discuss selection effects and analysis methods relevant to its study.
Existing research points to a number of detailed patterns in the BE, involving
emission-line profiles and ionization, luminosity range, and radio properties,
that provide clues to the underlying physics driving the correlation. We
present a comparative analysis of the ""global"" BE for AGN ensembles and the
""intrinsic"" BE seen in variable Seyfert nuclei, and also examine similarities
and differences in BEs reported in the optical/UV and X-ray bandpasses. A
summary of measurements for quasars at high redshift (z > 4) suggests that the
BE persists among these extreme objects. We close with an assessment of current
needs and future opportunities for strengthening the observational picture of
the BE.

Title:Cosmological constraints from lensing statistics and supernovae on the cosmic equation of state,"
Abstract:  We investigate observational constraints from lensing statistics and high-z
type Ia supernovae on flat cosmological models with nonrelativistic matter and
an exotic fluid with equation of state, $p_x=(m/3 -1)\rho_x$. We show that
agreement with both tests at the 68% confidence level is possible if the
parameter $m$ is low ($m \lesssim 0.85$) and $0.24 \lesssim \Omega_{m0}
\lesssim 0.38$ with lower values of $\Omega_{m0}$ corresponding to higher $m$.
We find that a conventional cosmological constant model with $\Omega_{m0}\simeq

Title:Morphology of the Virgo Cluster: Gas versus Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We draw a quantitative comparison of the distribution of the galaxies and the
intra-cluster gas in the Virgo cluster by extending the morphological analysis
by Binggeli et al. (1987) to the intra-cluster gas. We use the Virgo Cluster
Catalog in combination with data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. The galaxy
distribution and the gas distribution are relatively similar. In both wavebands
the irregular structure of Virgo can be decomposed into three major subclusters
centred on M87, M49, and M86. A new statistical method of subcluster
decomposition is applied. Radial galaxy and X-ray density profiles of the three
subclusters are fitted with beta-models, allowing analytic deprojection.
Comparison of these profiles reveals, that there is no general luminosity
segregation. The gas density profile is steeper than the galaxy density profile
in the inner part, while this trend is reversed in the outer part. A comparison
among the subclusters shows the poorer the subcluster the steeper its radial
profile, i.e. the more compact it is, both in the optical and the X-rays. The
subcluster profiles for different Hubble types confirm the well-known result
that the distribution of the late-type galaxies is more extended than the early
types. Differential and integrated mass density profiles of the different
components in the M87 and M49 subclusters are presented. The total, gravitating
mass is inferred from the distribution of the X-ray gas. In the M87 subcluster
the gas mass is about three times the mass in galaxies, while it accounts only
for 8% to 14% of the total mass at 0.4 and 1 Mpc, respectively. In the M49
subcluster there is more mass in the galaxies than in the gas and the
gas-to-total mass fraction is only 1%, which is unusually low for a cluster.
The mass-to-light ratios show relatively constant values around 500Msol/Lsol.

Title:Optical-Infrared Colour Distribution of a Statistically-Complete Sample of Faint Field Spheroidal Galaxies,"
Abstract:  In hierarchical models, where spheroidals are primarily produced via the
merger of disk galaxies, the number of intrinsically red systems at faint
limits will be substantially lower than that expected in ""traditional"" models
where the bulk of star formation was completed at high redshifts. We analyse
the optical--near-infrared colour distribution of a large flux-limited sample
of field spheroidal galaxies identified morphologically from archival Hubble
Space Telescope data. The $I_{814}-HK'$ colour distribution for a sample
jointly limited at $I_{814}<$23 mag and $HK'<$19.5 mag is used to constrain the
star formation history of elliptical and S0 galaxies. We detect a significant
deficit of intrinsically red spheroids. From limited spectroscopic and deeper
photometric redshift data, we demonstrate that this deficit results from a
strong evolutionary effect. The space density of spheroidals of all colours at
faint limits is lower than expected for a population of constant comoving
density. We conclude that field ellipticals cannot have formed all of their
stars at high redshift, as has been suggested for the bulk of their clustered
counterparts. We compare alternative evolutionary histories with our data,
including an analytical representation of recent models based on the
hierarchical assembly of ellipticals, which provides a better, though not ideal
fit. The accumulation of spectroscopic redshifts for our sample will allow a
quantitative discrimination between models with extended star formation.

Title:The effective electron mass in core-collapse supernovae,"
Abstract:  Finite temperature field theory is used to calculate the correction to the
mass of the electron in plasma with finite temperature and arbitrary chemical
potential, and the results are applied to the core regions of type II
supernovae (SNe). It is shown that the effective electron mass varies between 1
MeV at the edge of the SN core up to 11 MeV near the center. This changed
electron mass affects the rates of the electroweak processes which involve
electrons and positrons. Due to the high electron chemical potential, the total
emissivities and absorptivities of interactions involving electrons are only
reduced a fraction of a percent. However, for interactions involving positrons,
the emissivities and absorptivities are reduced by up to 20 percent. This is of
particular significance for the reaction antineutrino + proton <-> positron +
neutron which is a source of opacity for antineutrinos in the cores of type II
SNe.

Although the Virgo cluster has such an irregular structure, it seems that
within each of the subclusters some kind of equilibrium has already
established. X-ray observations of distant lensing clusters reveal very
different properties. The large range of X-ray properties without any obvious
correlation between them shows that cluster evolution is complex, i.e. not
every cluster is evolving in the same way. A comparison of nearby clusters and
distant clusters shows that there is no clear trend with time in any of the

Title:Spallative Nucleosynthesis in Supernova Remnants. I. Analytical Estimates,"
Abstract:  Spallative nucleosynthesis is thought to be the only process capable of
producing significant amount of Beryllium (Be) in the universe. Therefore, both
energetic particles (EPs) and nuclei to be spalled (most efficiently C, N and O
nuclei in this case) are required, which indicates that supernovae (SNe) may be
directly involved in the synthesis of the Be nuclei observed in the halo stars
of the Galaxy. We apply current knowledge relating to supernova remnant (SNR)
evolution and particle shock acceleration to calculate the total Be yield
associated with a SN explosion in the interstellar medium, focusing on the
first stages of Galactic chemical evolution (i.e. when metallicity Z < 0.01
Z_odot) We show that dynamical aspects must be taken into account carefully,
and present analytical calculations of the spallation reactions induced by the
EPs accelerated at both the forward and the reverse shocks following the SN
explosion. Our results show that the production of Be in the early Galaxy is

Title:An unstable inner disk in Cyg X-1 ?,"
Abstract:  We present the first significant detection of relativistic smearing of the
X-ray reflection spectrum from the putative accretion disk in the low/hard
state of Cyg X--1. The ionization state, and amount of relativistic smearing
are simultaneously constrained by the X-ray spectra, and we conclude that the
disk is not strongly ionised, does not generally extend down to the last stable
orbit at 3 Schwarzschild radii and covers rather less than half the sky as seen
from the X-ray source. These results are consistent with a geometry where the
optically thick disk truncates at a few tens of Schwarzschild radii, with the
inner region occupied by the X-ray hot, optically thin(ish) plasma. Such a
geometry is also inferred from previous studies of the reflected spectrum in
Galactic Black Hole transient sources, and from detailed considerations of the
overall continuum spectral shape, suggesting that there is some robust
instability which disrupts the inner accretion disk in low/hard state Galactic
Black Holes.

depending on the intensity and time history of the burst, and the distance of
the Ulysses spacecraft from Earth. This annulus generally intersects the BATSE

Title:The outburst radial velocity curve of X-Ray Nova Scorpii 1994 (=GRO J1655--40),"
Abstract:  We present a reanalysis of the outburst radial velocity data for X-Ray Nova
Scorpii 1994. Using a model based on X-ray heating of the secondary star we
suggest a more realistic treatment of the radial velocity data. Solutions are
obtained in the (K_2,q) plane which, when combined with the published value for
the binary mass ratio and inclination, constrain the mass of the black hole to
within the region 4.1<M_1<6.6 Msun (90 per cent confidence), which is
significantly lower than the value obtained by Orosz & Bailyn (1997). This
reduced lower bound for the black hole mass together with the high space
velocity of the system is consistent with the idea that it was formed by the
post-supernova collapse of a neutron star.

Title:Probing the Large Scale Structure with QSOs and radio-galaxies,"
Abstract:  QSOs and radio-galaxies, together with the CMB, ``normal'' galaxies and
clusters, represent the main source of information about the origin and
evolution of the Large Scale Structure. They can be used either directly, as
tracers of the density peaks, or as cosmic lighthouses, probing the Universe
along the line of sight with their conspicuous flow of photons. The amplitude
of the QSO clustering has been measured to be $r_o \simeq 6 \hmpc$ at $z\sim 2$
and appears to increase with redshift. These properties are consistent with a
scenario in which the quasars, with a lifetime of $t \sim 10^8 yr$, sparsely
sample halos of mass greater than $M_{min} \sim 10^{12}-10^{13} h^{-1}$
M$_{\odot}$. Radio-galaxies are found to cluster on similar scales. The study
of QSO and radio-galaxy environments is in qualitative agreement with their
clustering properties. Absorption-line systems observed in high-resolution
spectra of QSOs show structure, including voids/underdensities and
overdensities, from the smallest scales to tens of Mpc. QSO pairs, groups and
lenses allow us to get a 3-D glimpse of the absorbers, providing invaluable
information about their size, ionization, mass. Great progress in this field is
expected from the new instrumentation coming into operation at the 8-m class
telescopes.

Title:The Evolution of Barred Spiral Galaxies in the Hubble Deep Fields North and South,"
Abstract:  The frequency of barred spiral galaxies as a function of redshift contains
important information on the gravitational influence of stellar disks in their
dark matter halos and also may distinguish between contemporary theories for
the origin of galactic bulges. In this paper we present a new quantitative
method for determining the strength of barred spiral structure, and verify its
robustness to redshift-dependent effects. By combining galaxy samples from the
Hubble Deep Field North with newly available data from the Hubble Deep Field
South, we are able to define a statistical sample of 18 objectively-defined
low-inclination barred spiral systems with $I_{814W}<23.2$ mag. Analysing the
proportion of barred spiral galaxies seen as a function of redshift, we find a
significant decline in the barred fraction beyond redshifts $z\simeq 0.5$. The
physical significance of this effect remains unclear, but several possibilities
include dynamically hotter (or increasingly dark-matter dominated)
high-redshift discs, or an enhanced efficiency in bar destruction at high
redshifts. By investigating the formation of the ``orthogonal'' axis of
Hubble's classification tuning fork, our result complements studies of
evolution in the early--late sequence, and pushes to later epochs the redshift
at which the Hubble classification sequence is observed to be in place.

Title:How the dark matter halos cluster in Lagrangian space,"
Abstract:  We investigate the clustering of dark matter halos in Lagrangian space in
terms of their two-point correlation function, spanning more than 4 orders of
magnitudes of halo masses. Analyzing a set of collisionless scale-free
128^3-particle N-body simulations with spectral indices n = -2,-1, we measure
the first two Lagrangian bias parameters b_1 and b_2 relating halo and mass
correlations. We find that the Mo & White leading-order formula for b_1
describes the clustering of halos with mass M ~ M_* quite accurately, where M_*
indicates the characteristic non-linear mass. Smaller halos turn out to be less
clustered in Lagrangian space than predicted by Mo & White. Our findings are
consistent with the recent results of Jing for the clustering of halo
populations in Eulerian space, demonstrating that the discrepancies between the
N-body and analytical Mo & White prediction for the bias exist already in
Lagrangian space. This shows that a more refined theoretical algorithm for
selecting halos in the initial conditions needs to be developed. Finally, we
present a very accurate fitting formula for the linear halo bias factor b_1 in
Lagrangian space.

Title:Afterglows from Gamma-ray Bursts,"
Abstract:  The successful discovery of X-ray, optical and radio afterglows of gamma-ray
bursts has significantly helped our understanding of these sources, and made
possible the identification of host galaxies at cosmological distances. The
energy release inferred rivals that of supernovae, while its photon energy
output may considerably exceed it. Current models envisage this to be the
outcome of a cataclysmic stellar event leading to a relativistically expanding
fireball, in which particles are accelerated at shocks and produce nonthermal
radiation. The substantial agreement between observations and the theoretical
predictions of the fireball shock model provide confirmation of the basic
aspects of this scenario. The continued observations show a diversity of
behavior, providing valuable constraints for more detailed models.

Title:Limb-Darkening of a K Giant in the Galactic Bulge: PLANET Photometry of MACHO 97-BLG-28,"
Abstract:  We present the PLANET photometric dataset for the binary-lens microlensing
event MACHO 97-BLG-28 consisting of 696 I and V-band measurements, and analyze
it to determine the radial surface brightness profile of the Galactic bulge
source star. The microlensed source, demonstrated to be a K giant by our
independent spectroscopy, crossed the central isolated cusp of the lensing
binary, generating a sharp peak in the light curve that was well-resolved by
dense (3 - 30 minute) and continuous monitoring from PLANET sites in Chile,
South Africa, and Australia. Our modeling of these data has produced stellar
profiles for the source star in the I and V bands that are in excellent
agreement with those predicted by stellar atmospheric models for K giants. The
limb-darkening coefficients presented here are the first derived from
microlensing, among the first for normal giants by any technique, and the first
for any star as distant as the Galactic bulge. Modeling indicates that the
lensing binary has a mass ratio q = 0.23 and an (instantaneous) separation in
units of the angular Einstein ring radius of d = 0.69 . For a lens in the
Galactic bulge, this corresponds to a typical stellar binary with a projected
separation between 1 and 2 AU. If the lens lies closer, the separation is
smaller, and one or both of the lens objects is in the brown dwarf regime.
Assuming that the source is a bulge K2 giant at 8 kpc, the relative lens-source
proper motion is mu = 19.4 +/- 2.6 km/s /kpc, consistent with a disk or bulge
lens. If the non-lensed blended light is due to a single star, it is likely to
be a young white dwarf in the bulge, consistent with the blended light coming
from the lens itself.

Title:Predictions for the clustering properties of the Lyman-alpha Forest - I. One-point statistics,"
Abstract:  We present predictions for the one-point probability distribution and
cumulants of the transmitted QSO flux in the high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$
Forest. We make use of the correlation between the Lyman-$\alpha$ optical depth
and the underlying matter density predicted by gravitational instability theory
and seen in numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We have modelled the growth of
matter fluctuations using the non-linear shear-free dynamics, an approximation
which reproduces well the results of perturbation theory for the cumulants in
the linear and weakly non-linear clustering regime. As high matter
overdensities tend to saturate in spectra, the statistics of the flux
distribution are dominated by weakly non-linear overdensities. As a result, our
analytic approach can produce accurate predictions, when tested against N-body
simulation results, even when the underlying matter field has rms fluctuations
larger than unity. Our treatment can be applied to either Gaussian or
non-Gaussian initial conditions. Here we concentrate on the former case, but
also include a study of a specific non-Gaussian model. We discuss how the
methods and predictions we present can be used as a tool to study the generic
clustering properties of the \lya forest at high-redshift.
With such an approach, rather than concentrating on simulating specific
cosmological models, we may be in the position to directly test our assumptions
for the Gaussian nature of the initial conditions, and the gravitational
instability origin of structure itself. In a separate paper we present results
for two-point statistics.

source coincident with the nucleus, at H and J we identify diffuse structure
extending to the NE as a possible ionisation cone. By considering the NIR

A J-K image reveals a band of high extinction across the nucleus lying
perpendicular to the radio jet axis, as suggested by previous authors (Israel

Title:Astrometric and Timing Effects of Gravitational Waves from Localized Sources,"
Abstract:  A consistent approach for an exhaustive solution of the problem of
propagation of light rays in the field of gravitational waves emitted by a
localized source of gravitational radiation is developed in the first
post-Minkowskian and quadrupole approximation of General Relativity. We
demonstrate that the equations of light propagation in the retarded
gravitational field of an arbitrary localized source emitting quadrupolar
gravitational waves can be integrated exactly. The influence of the
gravitational field on the light propagation is examined not only in the wave
zone but also in cases when light passes through the intermediate and near
zones of the source. Explicit analytic expressions for light deflection and
integrated time delay (Shapiro effect) are obtained accounting for all possible
retardation effects and arbitrary relative locations of the source of
gravitational waves, that of light rays, and the observer. It is shown that the
ADM and harmonic gauge conditions can both be satisfied simultaneously outside
the source of gravitational waves. Their use drastically simplifies the
integration of light propagation equations and those for the motion of light
source and observer in the field of the source of gravitational waves, leading
to the unique interpretation of observable effects. The two limiting cases of
small and large values of impact parameter are elaborated in more detail.
Explicit expressions for Shapiro effect and deflection angle are obtained in
terms of the transverse-traceless part of the space-space components of the
metric tensor. We also discuss the relevance of the developed formalism for
interpretation of radio interferometric and timing observations, as well as for
data processing algorithms for future gravitational wave detectors.

Abstract:  This is the first in a series of papers on the construction and validation of

application to general relativistic astrophysics. This paper studies the
consistency and convergence of our general relativistic hydrodynamic treatment
and its coupling to the spacetime evolutions described by the full set of
Einstein equations with a perfect fluid source. The numerical treatment of the
general relativistic hydrodynamic equations is based on high resolution shock
capturing schemes. These schemes rely on the characteristic information of the
system. A spectral decomposition for general relativistic hydrodynamics
suitable for a general spacetime metric is presented. Evolutions based on three
different approximate Riemann solvers coupled to four different discretizations
of the Einstein equations are studied and compared. The coupling between the
hydrodynamics and the spacetime (the right and left hand side of the Einstein
equations) is carried out in a treatment which is second order accurate in {\it
both} space and time. Convergence tests for all twelve combinations with a
variety of test beds are studied, showing consistency with the differential
equations and correct convergence properties. The test-beds examined include
shocktubes, Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology tests, evolutions of
self-gravitating compact (TOV) stars, and evolutions of relativistically
boosted TOV stars. Special attention is paid to the numerical evolution of
strongly gravitating objects, e.g., neutron stars, in the full theory of

region of the star (where the rest mass density is abruptly dropping to zero).

Abstract:  We investigate higher than the first order gravitational perturbations in the

outgoing gravitational radiation, can be uncoupled into a single wave equation
to any perturbative order. For second order perturbations about a Kerr black
hole, we prove the existence of a first and second order gauge (coordinates)
and tetrad invariant waveform, $\psi_I$, by explicit construction. This
waveform is formed by the second order piece of $\psi_4$ plus a term, quadratic
in first order perturbations, chosen to make $\psi_I$ totally invariant and to
have the appropriate behavior in an asymptotically flat gauge. $\psi_I$
fulfills a single wave equation of the form ${\cal T}\psi_I=S,$ where ${\cal
T}$ is the same wave operator as for first order perturbations and $S$ is a
source term build up out of (known to this level) first order perturbations. We
discuss the issues of imposition of initial data to this equation, computation
of the energy and momentum radiated and wave extraction for direct comparison
with full numerical approaches to solve Einstein equations.

field dynamics in a Friedman-Robertson-Walker background fall into this class
but models in which inflation originates at the Planck epoch, {\it eg.} chaotic

general relativistic constraints on the structure of spacetime. We discuss

Title:Spikes in Cosmic Crystallography,"
Abstract:  If the universe is multiply connected and small the sky shows multiple images
of cosmic objects, correlated by the covering group of the 3-manifold used to
model it. These correlations were originally thought to manifest as spikes in
pair separation histograms (PSH) built from suitable catalogues. Using
probability theory we derive an expression for the expected pair separation
histogram (EPSH) in a rather general topological-geometrical-observational
setting. As a major consequence we show that the spikes of topological origin
in PSH's are due to translations, whereas other isometries manifest as tiny
deformations of the PSH corresponding to the simply connected case. This result
holds for all Robertson-Walker spacetimes and gives rise to two basic
corollaries: (i) that PSH's of Euclidean manifolds that have the same
translations in their covering groups exhibit identical spike spectra of
topological origin, making clear that even if the universe is flat the
topological spikes alone are not sufficient for determining its topology; and
(ii) that PSH's of hyperbolic 3-manifolds exhibit no spikes of topological
origin. These corollaries ensure that cosmic crystallography, as originally
formulated, is not a conclusive method for unveiling the shape of the universe.
We also present a method that reduces the statistical fluctuations in PSH's
built from simulated catalogues.

Title:Early cosmology and the stochastic gravitational wave background,"
Abstract:  The epoch when the Universe had a temperature higher than a GeV is long
before any time at which we have reliable observations constraining the
cosmological evolution. For example, the occurrence of a second burst of
inflation (sometimes called thermal inflation) at a lower energy scale than
standard inflation, or a short epoch of early matter domination, cannot be
ruled out by present cosmological data. The cosmological stochastic
gravitational wave background, on scales accessible to interferometer
detection, is sensitive to non-standard cosmologies of this type. We consider
the implications of such alternative models both for ground-based experiments
such as LIGO and space-based proposals such as LISA. We show that a second
burst of inflation leads to a scale-dependent reduction in the spectrum.
Applied to conventional inflation, this further reduces an already
disappointingly low signal. In the pre big bang scenario, where a much more
potent signal is possible, the amplitude is reduced but the background remains
observable by LISA in certain parameter space regions. In each case, a second
epoch of inflation induces oscillatory features into the spectrum in a manner
analogous to the acoustic peaks in the density perturbation spectrum. On LIGO
scales, perturbations can only survive through thermal inflation with
detectable amplitudes if their amplitudes were at one time so large that linear
perturbation theory is inadequate. Although for an epoch of early matter
domination the reduction in the expected signal is not as large as the one
caused by a second burst of inflation, the detection in the context of the pre
big bang scenario may not be possible since the spectrum peaks around the LIGO
frequency window and for lower frequencies behaves as $f^3$.

is not accelerating. In particular, we show that only two types of large time
behavior exist: an exponential regime, and a subexponential expansion with the
logarithmic derivative of the scale factor tending to zero. In the case of the
subexponetial expansion the Universe accelerates when the scalar field energy
density is dominant and the potential behaves in a specified manner, or if
matter violates the strong energy conditon $\rho + 3p >0$. When the expansion
is exponential the Universe accelerates, and the scalar field energy density is
dominant. We also find that the existence of the Big Bang and a never ending
expansion of the Universe constrain the equation of state of matter at large

Abstract:  In recent years, the use of conformal transformation techniques has become
widespread in the literature on gravitational theories alternative to general

the transformation to the Einstein frame is generated by a fundamental scalar
field already present in the theory. In this context, the problem of which
conformal frame is the physical one has to be dealt with and, in the general
case, it has been clarified only recently; the formulation of a theory in the

this article, we review the literature on conformal transformations in

particularly urgent to refer the analysis of experimental tests of Brans-Dicke

Title:Initial Hypersurface Formulation: Hamilton-Jacobi Theory for Strongly Coupled Gravitational Systems,"
Abstract:  Strongly coupled gravitational systems describe Einstein gravity and matter
in the limit that Newton's constant G is assumed to be very large. The
nonlinear evolution of these systems may be solved analytically in the
classical and semiclassical limits by employing a Green function analysis.
Using functional methods in a Hamilton-Jacobi setting, one may compute the
generating functional (`the phase of the wavefunctional') which satisfies both
the energy constraint and the momentum constraint. Previous results are
extended to encompass the imposition of an arbitrary initial hypersurface. A
Lagrange multiplier in the generating functional restricts the initial fields,
and also allows one to formulate the energy constraint on the initial
hypersurface. Classical evolution follows as a result of minimizing the
generating functional with respect to the initial fields. Examples are given
describing Einstein gravity interacting with either a dust field and/or a
scalar field. Green functions are explicitly determined for (1) gravity, dust,
a scalar field and a cosmological constant and (2) gravity and a scalar field
interacting with an exponential potential. This formalism is useful in solving
problems of cosmology and of gravitational collapse.

Title:Spacetime Exterior to a Star: Against Asymptotic Flatness,"
Abstract:  In many circumstances the perfect fluid conservation equations can be
directly integrated to give a Geometric-Thermodynamic equation: typically that
the lapse $N$ is the reciprocal of the enthalphy $h$, ($ N=1/h$). This result
is aesthetically appealing as it depends only on the fluid conservation
equations and does not depend on specific field equations such as Einstein's.
Here the form of the Geometric-Thermodynamic equation is derived subject to
spherical symmetry and also for the shift-free ADM formalism. There at least
three applications of the Geometric-Thermodynamic equation, the most important
being to the notion of asympotic flatness and hence to spacetime exterior to a
star. For asymptotic flatness one wants $h\to 0$ and $N\to 1$ simultaneously,
but this is incompatible with the Geometric-Thermodynamic equation.
Observational data and asymptotic flatness are discussed. It is argued that a

Title:Double D-term inflation,"
Abstract:  Comparisons of cosmological models to current data show that the presence of
a non-trivial feature in the primordial power spectrum of fluctuations, around
the scale k=0.05 h/Mpc, is an open and exciting possibility, testable in a near
future. This could set new constraints on inflationary models. In particular,
current data favour a Lambda-CDM model with a steplike spectrum, and more power
on small scales. So far, this possibility has been implemented only in toy
models of inflation. In this work, we propose a supersymmetric model with two
U(1) gauge symmetries, associated with two Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. Partial
cancellation of the Fayet-Iliopoulos by one of the charged fields generates a
step in the primordial power spectrum of adiabatic perturbations. We show that
when this field if charged under both symmetries, the spectrum may have more
power on small scales.

"Title:Non-Equilibrium Bose-Einstein Condensates, Dynamical Scaling and Symmetric Evolution in large N Phi^4 theory","
Abstract:  We analyze the non-equilibrium dynamics of the O(N) Phi^4 model in the large
N limit and for states of large energy density. The dynamics is dramatically
different when the energy density is above the top of the tree level potential
V_0 than when it is below it.When the energy density is below V_0, we find that
non-perturbative particle production through spinodal instabilities provides a
dynamical mechanism for the Maxwell construction. The asymptotic values of the
order parameter only depend on the initial energy density and all values
between the minima of the tree level potential are available, the asymptotic
dynamical `effective potential' is flat between the minima. When the energy
density is larger than V_0, the evolution samples ergodically the broken
symmetry states, as a consequence of non-perturbative particle production via
parametric amplification. Furthermore, we examine the quantum dynamics of phase
ordering into the broken symmetry phase and find novel scaling behavior of the
correlation function. There is a crossover in the dynamical correlation length
at a time scale t_s \sim \ln(1/lambda). For t < t_s the dynamical correlation
length \xi(t) \propto \sqrt{t} and the evolution is dominated by spinodal
instabilities, whereas for t>t_s the evolution is non-linear and dominated by
the onset of non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of long-wavelength
Goldstone this http URL this regime a true scaling solution emerges with a non-
perturbative anomalous scaling length dimension z=1/2 and a dynamical
correlation length \xi(t) \propto (t-t_s). The equal time correlation function
in this scaling regime vanishes for r>2(t-t_s) by causality. For t > t_s the
equal time correlation function falls of as 1/r. A semiclassical but stochastic
description emerges for time scales t > t_s.

Title:Illuminating dark matter and primordial black holes with interstellar antiprotons,"
Abstract:  Interstellar antiproton fluxes can arise from dark matter annihilating or
decaying into quarks or gluons that subsequently fragment into antiprotons.
Evaporation of primordial black holes also can produce a significant antiproton
cosmic-ray flux. Since the background of secondary antiprotons from spallation
has an interstellar energy spectrum that peaks at $\sim 2\gev$ and falls
rapidly for energies below this, low-energy measurements of cosmic antiprotons
are useful in the search for exotic antiproton sources. However, measurement of
the flux near the earth is challenged by significant uncertainties from the
effects of the solar wind. We suggest evading this problem and more effectively
probing dark-matter signals by placing an antiproton spectrometer aboard an
interstellar probe currently under discussion. We address the experimental
challenges of a light, low-power-consuming detector, and present an initial
design of such an instrument. This experimental effort could significantly
increase our ability to detect, and have confidence in, a signal of exotic,
nonstandard antiproton sources. Furthermore, solar modulation effects in the
heliosphere would be better quantified and understood by comparing results to
inverse modulated data derived from existing balloon and space-based detectors
near the earth.

Title:Vacuum oscillations and the distorted solar neutrino spectrum observed by Superkamiokande,"
Abstract:  The excess of solar-neutrino events above 13 MeV that has been recently
observed by Superkamiokande can be explained by vacuum oscillations (VO). If
the boron neutrino flux is 20% smaller than the standard solar model (SSM)
prediction and the chlorine signal is assumed 30% (or 3.5 sigmas) higher than
the measured one, there exists a VO solution that reproduces both the observed
boron neutrino spectrum, including the high energy distortion, and the other
measured neutrino rates. This solution might already be testable by the
predicted anomalous seasonal variation of the gallium signal. Its most distinct
signature, a large anomalous seasonal variation of Be7 neutrino flux, can be
easily observed by the future detectors, BOREXINO and LENS.

Abstract:  In D-term inflation models, Affleck-Dine baryogenesis produces isocurvature
density fluctuations. These can be perturbations in the baryon number, or, in
the case where the present neutralino density comes directly from B-ball decay,
perturbations in the number of dark matter neutralinos. The latter case results
in a large enhancement of the isocurvature perturbation. The requirement that
the deviation of the adiabatic perturbations from scale invariance due to the
Affleck-Dine field is not too large then imposes a lower bound on the magnitude
of the isocurvature fluctuation of about $10^{-2}$ times the adiabatic
perturbation. This should be observable by MAP and PLANCK.

Title:String derived MSSM and M-theory Unification,"
Abstract:  The recent conjecture of possible equivalence between the string scale $M_S$
and the minimal supersymmetric standard model unification scale M_U ~ 2.5 x
10^{16} GeV is considered in the context of string models. This conjecture
suggests that the observable gauge group just below the string scale should be
SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y and that the SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y-charged
spectrum of the observable sector should consist solely of the MSSM spectrum.
We demonstrate that string models can actually be constructed that possess
these observable features. Two aspects generic to many classes of three family
SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y string models are both an extra local anomalous
U(1)_A and numerous (often fractionally charged) exotic particles beyond the
MSSM. Thus, for these classes, the key to obtaining an M_S = M_U ~ 2.5 x
10^{16} GeV string model is the existence of F- and D-flat directions that near
the string scale can simultaneously break the anomalous U(1) and give mass to
all exotic SM-charged observable particles, decoupling them from the low energy
spectrum. In this letter we show, in the context of free fermionic strings,
that string models with flat directions possessing these features do exist. We
present one such string derived model in which all such exotic observable
states beyond the MSSM receive mass at the scale generated by the Fayet-
Iliopoulos term. The associated F- and D-flat direction is proven flat to all
orders of the superpotential.

Title:Generalized Limits to the Number of Light Particle Degrees of Freedom from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,"
Abstract:  We compute the big bang nucleosynthesis limit on the number of light neutrino
degrees of freedom in a model-independent likelihood analysis based on the

simultaneously constrain the baryon-to-photon ratio and the number of light
neutrinos for a range of He4 abundances $Y_p$ = 0.225 -- 0.250, as well as a
range in primordial Li7 abundances from (1.6 to 4.1) $ \times 10^{-10}$. For
(Li7/H)$_p = 1.6 \times 10^{-10}$, as can be inferred from the Li7 data from
Population II halo stars, the upper limit to $N_\nu$ based on the current best
estimate of the primordial He4 abundance of $Y_p = 0.238$, is $N_\nu < 4.3$ and
varies from $N_\nu < 3.3$ (at 95% C.L.) when $Y_p=0.225$ to $N_\nu < 5.3$ when
$Y_p=0.250$. If Li7 is depleted in these stars the upper limit to $N_\nu$ is
relaxed. Taking (Li7/H)$_p = 4.1 \times 10^{-10}$, the limit varies from $N_\nu
< 3.9$ when $Y_p = 0.225$ to $N_\nu \la 6$ when $Y_p = 0.250$. We also consider
the consequences on the upper limit to $N_\nu$ if recent observations of

Title:Diffuse Ionization in the Milky Way and Sterile Neutrinos,"
Abstract:  We propose the radiative decay of sterile neutrinos which fill a fraction of

as a way to explain the observed diffuse ionization in the Milky Way galaxy.
Since the sterile neutrino number density in the present universe can be
adjusted by arranging its dynamics appropriately, the resulting hot dark matter
contribution to $\Omega_m$ can be small as required by many scenarios of
structure formation. On the other hand a 27.4 eV neutrino could easily be the
partial halo dark matter. One realization of this idea could be in the context
of a mirror universe theory where the gauge and matter content of the standard
model are completely duplicated in the mirror sector (except for an asymmetry
in the weak scale); the three mirror neutrinos can mix with the known neutrinos
via some strongly suppressed mechanism such as the gravitational or heavy right
handed neutrino mediated forces. Two of the mirror neutrinos (say $\nu'_{\mu}$
and $\nu'_{\tau}$) could play the role of the above sterile neutrino.

Title:Patterns from preheating,"
Abstract:  The formation of regular patterns is a well-known phenomenon in condensed
matter physics. Systems that exhibit pattern formation are typically driven and
dissipative with pattern formation occurring in the weakly non-linear regime
and sometimes even in more strongly non-linear regions of parameter space. In
the early universe, parametric resonance can drive explosive particle
production called preheating. The fields that are populated then decay quantum
mechanically if their particles are unstable. Thus, during preheating, a
driven-dissipative system exists. In this paper, we show that a self-coupled
inflaton oscillating in its potential at the end of inflation can exhibit
pattern formation.

may be efficiently produced by gravitational effects. Furthermore, in curved
spacetimes the transverse fluctuations of the D-branes develop a tachyonic mode
and when the fluctuations grow larger than the horizon the branes become
tensionless and break up. This signals a transition to a new regime. We discuss
the implications of our findings for the singularity problem present in string
cosmology, suggesting the existence of a limiting value for the curvature which
is in agreement with the value suggested by the cosmological version of the
holography principle. We also comment on possible implications for the

fields live inside some branes while gravitons live in the bulk.

Abstract:  We consider some aspects of inflation in models with large internal

with intermediate (M ~10^{11} GeV) to high (M ~ 10^{16} GeV) unification scale.
However, in all of these cases the wall inflation does not provide a complete

Abstract:  Pulsars are the most stable natural frequency standards. They can be applied
to a number of principal problems of modern astronomy and time-keeping
metrology. The full exploration of pulsar properties requires obtaining
unbiased estimates of the spin and orbital parameters. These estimates depend
essentially on the random noise component being revealed in the residuals of
time of arrivals (TOA). In the present paper, the influence of low-frequency
(""red"") timing noise with spectral indices from 1 to 6 on TOA residuals,
variances, and covariances of estimates of measured parameters of single and
binary pulsars are studied. In order to determine their functional dependence
on time, an analytic technique of processing of observational data in time
domain is developed which takes into account both stationary and non-stationary
components of noise. Our analysis includes a simplified timing model of a
binary pulsar in a circular orbit and procedure of estimation of pulsar
parameters and residuals under the influence of red noise. We reconfirm that
uncorrelated white noise of errors of measurements of TOA brings on gradually
decreasing residuals, variances and covariances of all parameters. On the other
hand, we show that any red noise causes the residuals, variances, and
covariances of certain parameters to increase with time. Hence, the low
frequency noise corrupts our observations and reduces experimental
possibilities for better tests of General Relativity Theory. We also treat in
detail the influence of a polynomial drift of noise on the residuals and
fitting parameters. Results of the analitic analysis are used for discussion of
a statistic describing stabilities of kinematic and dynamic pulsar time scales.

Thirteen F555W (V) and four F814W (I) epochs of cosmic-ray-split Wide Field and
Planetary Camera 2 observations were obtained. Twenty Cepheids were discovered,
with periods ranging from 12 to 49 days. Adopting a Large Magellanic Cloud
distance modulus and extinction of 18.50+/-0.10 mag and E(V-I)=0.13 mag,
respectively, a true reddening-corrected distance modulus (based on an analysis
employing the ALLFRAME software package) of 30.50 +/- 0.16 (random) +/- 0.17
(systematic) mag was determined for NGC 4725. The corresponding of distance of
12.6 +/- 1.0 (random) +/- 1.0 (systematic) Mpc is in excellent agreement with
that found with an independent analysis based upon the DoPHOT photometry
package. With a foreground reddening of only E(V-I)=0.02, the inferred
intrinsic reddening of this field in NGC 4725, E(V-I)=0.19, makes it one of the
most highly-reddened, encountered by the HST Key Project, to date.

Title:X-ray and gamma-ray emission from pulsar magnetospheres,"
Abstract:  For polar-cap models based on electromagnetic cascades induced by curvature
radiation of beam particles we calculate broad-band high-energy spe ctra of
pulsed emission expected for classical ($\sim 10^{12}\G$) and millisecond
pulsars ($\sim 10^9\G$). The spectra are a superposition of curvature and
synchrotron radiation components and most of their detailed features depend
significantly on the magnetic field strength. The relations of expected pulsed
luminosity \Lx (between 0.1 keV and 10 keV) as well as \Lg (above 100 keV) to
the spin-down luminosity \edot are presented. We conclude that spectral
properties and fluxes of pulsed non-thermal X-ray emission of some objects,
like the Crab or the millisecond pulsar B1821-24, pose a challenge to the
polar-cap models based on curvature and synchrotron radiation alone. On the
other hand, such models may offer an explanation for the case of B1706-44.

Title:The effect of supernova heating on cluster properties and constraints on galaxy formation models,"
Abstract:  Models of galaxy formation should be able to predict the properties of
clusters of galaxies, in particular their gas fractions, metallicities, X-ray
luminosity-temperature relation, temperature function and mass-deposition-rate
function. Fitting these properties places important constaints on galaxy
formation on all scales. By following gas processes in detail, our
semi-analytic model (based on that of Nulsen & Fabian 1997) is the only such
model able to predict all of the above cluster properties. We use realistic gas
fractions and gas density profiles, and as required by observations we break
the self-similarity of cluster structure by including supernova heating of
intracluster gas, the amount of which is indicated by the observed
metallicities. We also highlight the importance of the mass-deposition-rate
function as an independent and very sensitive probe of cluster structure.

Abstract:  We report the discovery with BeppoSAX of a new 170.84 +/- 0.04 s X-ray
pulsar, 1SAX J1324.4-6200, found serendipitously in the field of the X-ray
binary X1323-619 in 1997 August. The source and periodicity are also detected
in archival ASCA data taken in 1994. The X-ray spectrum is modeled by a
power-law with a photon index of 1.0 +/- 0.4 and absorption of (7.8 +2.7 -1.1)
10^22 atom cm-2. The source is located close to the galactic plane and within 3
arcmin of the direction of the dark cloud DC 306.8+0.6. The measured
interstellar absorption and cloud size imply a distance >3.4 kpc. This implies
a 1-10 keV source luminosity of >1.1 10^34 erg/sec during the BeppoSAX
observation. The source is not detected in earlier Einstein IPC and EXOSAT CMA
observations, most probably due to reduced detector efficency and lower
sensitivity to highly absorbed sources. The X-ray properties suggest that 1SAX
J1324.4-6200 is an accreting neutron star with a Be star companion.

Title:Closing in on Omega_0: The Amplitude of Mass Fluctuations from Galaxy Clusters and the Lyman-alpha Forest,"
Abstract:  We estimate the value of the matter density parameter \Omega_0 by combining
constraints from the galaxy cluster mass function with Croft et al.'s recent
measurement of the mass power spectrum, P(k), from \lya forest data. The key
assumption of the method is that cosmic structure formed by gravitational
instability from Gaussian primordial fluctuations. For a specified value of
\Omega_0, matching the observed cluster mass function then fixes the value of
\sigma_8, the rms amplitude of mass fluctuations in 8\hmpc spheres, and it thus
determines the normalization of P(k) at z=0. The value of \Omega_0 also
determines the ratio of P(k) at z=0 to P(k) at z=2.5, the central redshift of
the \lya forest data; the ratio is different for an open universe (\Lambda=0)
or a flat universe. Because the \lya forest measurement only reaches comoving
scales 2\pi/k ~ 15-20\hmpc, the derived value of \Omega_0 depends on the value
of the power spectrum shape parameter \Gamma, which determines the relative
contribution of larger scale modes to \sigma_8. Adopting \Gamma=0.2, a value
favored by galaxy clustering data, we find \Omega_0 = 0.46^{+0.12}_{-0.10} for
an open universe and \Omega_0=0.34^{+0.13}_{-0.09} for a flat universe (1\sigma
errors, not including the uncertainty in cluster normalization).
Cluster-normalized models with \Omega_0=1 predict too low an amplitude for P(k)
at z=2.5, while models with \Omega_0=0.1 predict too high an amplitude. The
more general best fit parameter combination is approximately \Omega_0 +
0.2\Lambda_0 = 0.46 + 1.3(\Gamma-0.2). Analysis of larger, existing samples of
QSO spectra could greatly improve the measurement of P(k) from the \lya forest,
allowing a determination of \Omega_0 by this method with a precision of ~15%,
limited mainly by uncertainty in the cluster mass function.

Abstract:  We have observed a sample of 15 and 8 quasars with redshifts between 0.11 and
0.87 (mean value 0.38) in the J and K' bands respectively. Eleven of the
quasars were previously known to be associated with extended emission line
regions. After deconvolution of the image, substraction of the PSF when
possible, and identification of companions with the help of HST archive images
when available, extensions are seen for at least eleven quasars. However,
average profiles are different from that of the PSF in only four objects, for
which a good fit is obtained with an $r^{1/4}$ law, suggesting that the
underlying galaxies are ellipticals. Redshifts were available in the literature
for surrounding objects in five quasar fields. For these objects, one to five
companion galaxies were found. One quasar even belongs to a richness class 1
cluster. Most other quasars in our sample have nearby galaxies in projection
which may also be companions. Environmental effects are therefore probably
important to account for the properties of these objects.

Title:ROSAT observations of the Sculptor galaxy NGC7793,"
Abstract:  We report here the results of spectral imaging observations with the ROSAT
PSPC of the field surrounding the very nearby (D=3.38 Mpc) Sculptor galaxy,
NGC7793. Many point sources are detected within the field, several of them
showing evidence for variability. Seven sources are seen to lie within the
optical confines of the system, the brightest (Lx ~ 9x10e38 erg/s), lying to
the southern edge of NGC7793. This source, also observed to be variable, is
seen now, not to be associated with a z=0.071 redshift QSO, as was previously
thought. A number of the other sources within the NGC7793 disc are likely to be
due to X-ray binaries, supernova remnants or superbubbles within the galaxy
itself. Other sources may be associated with background AGN. In addition to the
point source emission, rather uniform unresolved emission is detected in and
around NGC7793 extending to a radius of perhaps 4 kpc. This emission is likely
to be contaminated to some degree by unresolved point sources, as its
temperature (kT~1 keV) is rather hotter than is seen for the diffuse gas
components in other nearby spiral galaxies. Comparing the X-ray properties of
NGC7793 with those of the remaining Sculptor group members, suggests that it
may, in terms of activity, lie somewhere between its quiescent and starburst
neighbours.

Title:Tidally-induced warps in protostellar discs,"
Abstract:  We review results on the dynamics of warped gaseous discs. We consider tidal
perturbation of a Keplerian disc by a companion star orbiting in a plane
inclined to the disc. The perturbation induces the precession of the disc, and
thus of any jet it could drive. In some conditions the precession rate is
uniform, and as a result the disc settles into a warp mode. The tidal torque
also leads to the truncation of the disc, to the evolution of the inclination
angle (not necessarily towards alignment of the disc and orbital planes) and to
a transport of angular momentum in the disc. We note that the spectral energy
distribution of such a warped disc is different from that of a flat disc. We
conclude by listing observational effects of warps in protostellar discs.

Title:Tracing the Outer Structure of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy: Detections at Angular Distances Between 10 and 34 Degrees,"
Abstract:  We have obtained deep photometric data in 24 fields along the southeast
extension of the major axis of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph)
galaxy, and in four fields along the northwest extension. Using star counts at
the expected position of the Sgr upper main-sequence within the resulting
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), we unambiguously detect Sgr stars in the
southeast over the range 10--34 degreesfrom the galaxy's center. If Sgr is
symmetric, this implies a true major-axis diameter of at least 68 degrees, or
nearly 30 kpc if all portions of Sgr are equally distant from the Sun. Star
counts parallel to the galaxy's minor-axis reveal that Sgr remains quite broad
far from its center. This suggests that the outer portions of Sgr resemble a
stream rather than an extension of the ellipsoidal inner regions of the galaxy.
The inferred V-band surface brightness (SB) profile ranges from 27.3-30.5 mag
per arcsec**2 over this radial range and exhibits a change in slope approx 20
degrees from the center of Sgr. The scale length of the outer SB profile is
17.2 degrees, compared to 4.7 degrees in the central region of Sgr. We
speculate that this break in the SB profile represents a transition from the
main body of Sgr to a more extended `Sgr stream'. By integrating the SB profile
we estimate that the absolute visual magnitude of Sgr lies in the range -13.4
to -14.6, depending on the assumed structure of Sgr; an upper limit to the
luminosity of Sgr is therefore approx 5.8x10**7 Solar Luminosities. This result
lowers the V-band M/L ratio inferred for Sgr by Ibata et al. (1997) down to
approx 10, consistent with values observed in the most luminous dSph companions
of the Milky Way.

Abstract:  We present evolutionary synthesis models applied to near--infrared spectral

starburst galaxies. The temporal evolution of the first and second overtones of
CO at 2.29 micron (2-0 bandhead) and 1.62 micron (6-3 bandhead) and of the

evolutionary tracks of massive stars with sub-solar chemical composition in the
red supergiant phase are not reliable for any synthesis of the temporal
evolution of infrared stellar features. The high sensitivity of the selected
infrared features to the atmospheric parameters of cool stars allows us to
place constraints on the temperature and the fraction of time spent in the red
part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram by massive stars during their
core-helium burning phase. We derive a set of empirically calibrated
spectrophotometric models by adjusting the red supergiant parameters such that
the properties of the observed templates are reproduced.

Title:Compton reflection and iron fluorescence in AGN and GBHCs,"
Abstract:  Any cold, optically-thick matter in the vicinity of an accreting black hole,
such as the accretion disk, can intercept and reprocess some fraction of the
hard X-ray continuum emission, thereby imprinting atomic features into the
observed spectrum. This process of `X-ray reflection' primarily gives rise to a
broad reflection `hump' peaking at 30keV and an iron emission line at 6.4keV.
In this review, I briefly describe the physics of this process before reviewing
the observations of these features in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and Galactic
black hole candidates (GBHCs). In some AGN, Seyfert galaxies in particular, the
iron line is found to be very broad and asymmetric. It is believed that such
lines arise from the innermost regions of the accretion disk, with
mildly-relativistic Doppler shifts and gravitational redshifts combining to
produce the line profile. Hence, such lines give us a direct observational
probe of the region within several gravitational radii of the black hole. The
complications that plague similar studies of GBHCs, such as disk ionization and
the possibly of inner disk disruption, are also addressed. I conclude with a
discussion of iron line reverberation, i.e. temporal changes of the iron line
as `echos' of large X-ray flares sweep across the accretion disk. It is shown
that interesting reverberation effects, such as a definitive signature of
extremal Kerr geometry, is within reach of high throughput spectrometers such
as Constellation-X.

Title:Relation between supersoft X-ray sources and VY Scl stars,"
Abstract:  In a recent ROSAT observation, taken during its optical low state, we found
that the VY Scl star V751 Cyg was a highly luminous source of soft X-rays. The
ROSAT HRI count rate of V751 Cyg was a factor of 10-20 higher than upper limits
obtained with ROSAT during previous observations, during which V751 Cyg
happened to be in the optical high state. Analysis of the X-ray spectrum
suggests a very low temperature (kT~15 eV) and a bolometric luminosity of
5*10^36 (D/500 pc)^2 erg/s. These values are characteristic of supersoft X-ray
sources. Based on the supersoft nature of V751 Cyg and the similarity of the
variability pattern of VY Scl stars and the supersoft transient source RX
J0513.9-6951 we hypothezise a relation between VY Scl stars and supersoft X-ray
sources. It is conceivable that VY Scl stars are all supersoft binaries (SSB),
that they form an extension of the previously known class of SSBs towards lower
white dwarf masses and lower temperatures.

Title:On the evolution of shape in N-body simulations,"
Abstract:  A database on shape evolution of direct N-body models formed out of cold,
dissipationless collapse is generated using GRAPE and HARP special purpose
computers. Such models are important to understand the formation of elliptical
galaxies.
Three dynamically distinct phases of shape evolution were found, first a fast
dynamical collapse which gives rise to the radial orbit instability (ROI) and
generates at its end the maximal triaxiality of the system. Subsequently, two
phases of violent and two-body shape relaxation occur, which drive the system
first towards axisymmetry, finally to spherical symmetry (the final state,
however, is still much more concentrated than the initial model).
In a sequence of models the influence of numerical and physical parameters,
like particle number, softening, initial virial ratio, timestep choice,
different N-body codes, are examined. We find that an improper combination of
softening and particle number can produce erroneous results. Selected models
were evolved on the secular timescale until they became spherically symmetric
again. The secular shape relaxation time scale is shown to agree very well with
the two-body relaxation time, if softening is properly taken into account for
the latter. Finally, we argue, that the intermediate phase of violent shape
relaxation after collapse is induced by strong core oscillations in the centre,
which cause potential fluctuations, dampening out the triaxiality.

attaining extremely high (~10^5) peak-to-noise dynamic range over a wide field.
For the first time the inner dust shell has been resolved in the near-infrared
to reveal a one-sided extension of circumstellar emission within 0.1"" (~15

shell at 1.65 micron, 2.26 micron, and 3.08 micron have been estimated to be
1.86 +/- 0.42, 0.85 +/- 0.20, and 0.44 +/- 0.11. These new results allow the
bolometric luminosity of VY~CMa to be estimated independent of the dust shell
geometry, yielding L_star ~ 2x10^5 L_sun. A variety of dust condensations,
including a large scattering plume and a bow-shaped dust feature, were observed
in the faint, extended nebula up to 4"" from the central source. While the
origin of the nebulous plume remains uncertain, a geometrical model is
developed assuming the plume is produced by radially-driven dust grains forming
at a rotating flow insertion point with a rotational period between 1200-4200
years, which is perhaps the stellar rotational period or the orbital period of
an unseen companion.

Title:Carbon in Spiral Galaxies from Hubble Space Telescope Spectroscopy,"
Abstract:  We present measurements of the gas-phase C/O abundance ratio in six H II
regions in the spiral galaxies M101 and NGC 2403, based on ultraviolet
spectroscopy using the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope.
The C/O ratios increase systematically with O/H in both galaxies, from log C/O
approximately -0.8 at log O/H = -4.0 to log C/O approx. -0.1 at log O/H = -3.4.
C/N shows no correlation with O/H. The rate of increase of C/O is somewhat
uncertain because of uncertainty as to the appropriate UV reddening law, and
uncertainty in the metallicity dependence on grain depletions. However, the
trend of increasing C/O with O/H is clear, confirming and extending the trend
in C/O indicated previously from observations of irregular galaxies. Our data
indicate that the radial gradients in C/H across spiral galaxies are steeper
than the gradients in O/H. Comparing the data to chemical evolution models for
spiral galaxies shows that models in which the massive star yields do not vary
with metallicity predict radial C/O gradients that are much flatter than the
observed gradients. The most likely hypothesis at present is that stellar winds
in massive stars have an important effect on the yields and thus on the
evolution of carbon and oxygen abundances. C/O and N/O abundance ratios in the
outer disks of spirals determined to date are very similar to those in dwarf
irregular galaxies. This implies that the outer disks of spirals have average
stellar population ages much younger than the inner disks.

severely limits the possible carriers of the kinetic luminosity at the base of
the jet, and favours a jet production and acceleration controlled by a magnetic
field whose value, at the base of the jet, exceeds $10^8$ Gauss. The Blandford

of cosmological parameters. We calculate the ages and metallicities of
elliptical galaxies in a standard CDM cosmology and show that we can reproduce
the observed correlation between magnitude and colour, and the scatter about
this relation. We also study the evolution of ellipticals to high redshift. In
rich clusters, the models predict a substantial population of ""evolved""
ellipticals at z>1. However, the average number density of bright ellipticals
must decrease at high redshift. The rate of decrease is sensitive to
cosmological parameters. In a high-density model, the abundance of bright
ellipticals declines by factor of 3 by z=1. In a low-density model (Omega=0.3,
Lambda=0.7), the abundance drops by 30% at z=1, but is down by a factor 3 at
z=2

"Title:The ROSAT view of NGC 1365: core emission, the highly variable source NGC 1365--X1 and alignments of surrounding X-ray sources","
Abstract:  We present a spectral and spatial analysis of the nuclear and circumnuclear
X-ray emission of the prominent southern starburst/Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365. To
describe the X-ray spectrum of the core source, we favour a two-component model
consisting of about equally strong contributions from a Raymond-Smith plasma
(with ~cosmic abundances) and a powerlaw. The origin of both components is
discussed, and a detailed comparison of the X-ray properties with
multi-wavelength observations of NGC 1365 and a large sample of type-I AGNs is
performed.
Among the surrounding X-ray sources we focus on an analysis of the enigmatic
source NGC 1365-X1, which is one of the most luminous and most highly variable
off-nuclear X-ray sources known so far.
Positions of further X-ray sources in the field of view are derived and it is
briefly pointed out that all HRI sources (except one) are `aligned' relative to
the central source.

Title:Observations of electromagnetically coupled dust in the Jovian magnetosphere,"
Abstract:  We report on dust measurements obtained during the seventh orbit of the
Galileo spacecraft about Jupiter. %which had a close flyby at Ganymede. The
most prominent features observed are highly time variable dust streams recorded
throughout the Jovian system. The impact rate varied by more than an order of
magnitude with a 5 and 10 hour periodicity, which shows a correlation with
Galileo's position relative to the Jovian magnetic field. This behavior can be
qualitatively explained by strong coupling of nanometer-sized dust to the
Jovian magnetic field. In addition to the 5 and 10 h periodicities, a longer
period which is compatible with Io's orbital period is evident in the dust
impact rate. This feature indicates that Io most likely is the source of the
dust streams. During a close (3,095 km altitude) flyby at Ganymede on 5 April
1997 an enhanced rate of dust impacts has been observed, which suggests that
Ganymede is a source of ejecta particles. Within a distance of about 25 $\rm
R_J$ (Jupiter radius, $\rm R_J = 71,492$ km) from Jupiter impacts of
micrometer-sized particles have been recorded which could be particles on bound
orbits about Jupiter.

Title:Computation of eigenmodes on a compact hyperbolic 3-space,"
Abstract:  Measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy are ideal
experiments for discovering the non-trivial global topology of the universe. To
evaluate the CMB anisotropy in multiply-connected compact cosmological models,
one needs to compute the eigenmodes of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Using the
direct boundary element method, we numerically obtain the low-lying eigenmodes
on a compact hyperbolic 3-space called the Thurston manifold which is the
second smallest in the known compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The computed
eigenmodes are expanded in terms of eigenmodes on the unit three-dimensional
pseudosphere. We numerically find that the expansion coefficients behave as
Gaussian pseudo-random numbers for low-lying eigenmodes. The observed
gaussianity in the CMB fluctuations can partially be attributed to the Gaussian
pseudo-randomness of the expansion coefficients assuming that the Gaussian
pseudo-randomness is the universal property of the compact hyperbolic spaces.

Title:A new assessment of the completeness of quasar surveys: implications for the luminosity function,"
Abstract:  We apply a simple statistical method (Derenzo & Hildebrand 1969) to
estimating the completeness of quasar surveys. It requires that an area has
been covered by two or more, preferably different, selection techniques. We use
three suitable data sets with separate selections from: variability and
UV-excess (170 quasars); objective prism and UV-excess (141 quasars);
multicolour and X-ray ({\it ROSAT,} 19 quasars). We find that, for selection by
UV-excess, the common limit of $U-B \le -0.35 \pm -0.05$ leads to losses of
$\sim 35%$, typically missing low-luminosity $(M_{B} \gtrsim -24.5)$ quasars,
independently of redshift. Systematic incompleteness will therefore affect the
new generation of large quasar surveys that select by $U-B \le -0.35$. By
correcting for this incompleteness, we find, from the first data set ($B <
21.0$ and $z < 2.2$), that the evolution of the quasar luminosity function (LF)
is best described by joint luminosity and density evolution. When extrapolated
to $z = 0$, the LF matches that of local Seyfert galaxies better than any
previous determination. The LF shows an increase in the number of
low-luminosity quasars at low redshifts and of brighter quasars at intermediate
redshifts, relative to the LF of Boyle et al. (1990). This result is consistent
with models in which quasars fade from an initial bright phase.

Title:Gravity-modes in ZZ Ceti Stars. II. Effects of Turbulent Dissipation,"
Abstract:  We investigate dynamical interactions between turbulent convection and g-mode
pulsations in ZZ Ceti variables (DAVs). Since our understanding of turbulence
is rudimentary, we are compelled to settle for order of magnitude results. A
key feature of these interactions is that convective response times are much
shorter than pulsation periods. Thus the dynamical interactions enforce near
uniform horizontal velocity inside the convection zone. They also give rise to
a narrow shear layer in the region of convective overshoot at the top of the
radiative interior. Turbulent damping inside the convection zone is negligible
for all modes, but that in the region of convective overshoot may be
significant for a few long period modes near the red edge of the instability
strip. These conclusions are in accord with those reached earlier by Brickhill.
Our major new result concerns nonlinear damping arising from the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the aforementioned shear layer. Amplitudes of
overstable modes saturate where dissipation due to this instability balances
excitation by convective driving. This mechanism of amplitude saturation is
most effective for long period modes, and it may play an important role in
defining the red edge of the instability strip.

Title:On the Photometric Consequences of Charge-Transfer Inefficiency in WFPC2,"
Abstract:  Charge-transfer effects in photometry with Wide Field Planetary Camera 2
aboard the Hubble Space Telescope are investigated by a comparison of WFPC2
observations with groundbased photometry for the Galactic globular clusters
omega Centauri and NGC 2419. Simple numerical formulae describing the fraction
of lost signal as functions of position on the detector, stellar brightness,
and the diffuse sky brightness recorded in an image are presented, and the
resulting corrections are compared to those previously derived by Whitmore &
Heyer (1997, Instrument Science Report WFPC2 97-08). Significant lost-charge
effects are seen that are proportional to both the Y coordinate (i.e., the
number of shifts along the parallel register during readout) and the X
coordinate (number of shifts along the serial register). The percentage of
charge lost decreases as the star brightness or the diffuse sky brightness
increases. Charge losses during the brief period when WFPC2 was operated at a
temperature of -76 degrees C were approximately 85% greater, but apart from
that no significant change in the charge transfer losses with time during the
first 3.5 years of WFPC2's mission is evident, except possibly a weak effect
for the very faintest star images. These results are quite similar to those of
Whitmore & Heyer, which were based on a much smaller data set, but there are
some differences in detail. Even with the present set of corrections,
additional sources of calibration uncertainty which I am unable identify or
characterize with the available data probably limit the external accuracy of
photometry from WFPC2 to of order 1-2%.

Title:An Exploration of the Tully-Fisher Relation for Extreme Late-Type Spiral Galaxies,"
Abstract:  This paper explores the adherence of 47 extreme late-type galaxies to the B-
and V-band Tully-Fisher relations defined by a sample of local calibrators. In
both bands we find the mean luminosity at a given line width for extreme
late-type spirals to lie below that predicted by standard Tully-Fisher
relations. While many of the extreme late-type spirals do follow the
Tully-Fisher relation to within our observational uncertainties, most of these
galaxies lie below the normal, linear Tully-Fisher relation, and some are
underluminous by more than 2 sigma (i.e. >1.16 magnitudes in V). This suggests
a possible downward curvature of the Tully-Fisher relation for some of the
smallest and faintest rotationally supported disk galaxies. This may be a
consequence of the increasing prevalence of dark matter in these systems. We
find the deviation from the Tully-Fisher relation to increase with decreasing
luminosity and decreasing optical linear size in our sample, implying that the
physically smallest and faintest spirals may be a structurally and
kinematically distinct class of objects.

Title:SPH Simulations of Galactic Gaseous Disk with Bar: Distribution and Kinematic Structure of Molecular Clouds toward the Galactic Center,"
Abstract:  We have performed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations to study
the response of molecular clouds in the Galactic disk to a rotating bar and
their subsequent evolution in the Galactic Center (GC) region. The Galactic
potential in our models is contributed by three axisymmetric components
(massive halo, exponential disk, compact bulge) and a non-axisymmetric bar.
These components are assumed to be invariant in time in the frame corotating
with the bar. Some noticeable features such as an elliptical outer ring, spiral
arms, a gas-depletion region, and a central concentration have been developed
due to the influence of the bar. The rotating bar induces non-circular motions
of the SPH particles, but hydrodynamic collisions tend to suppress the random
components of the velocity. The velocity field of the SPH particles is
consistent with the kinematics of molecular clouds observed in HCN (1-0)
transition; these clouds are thought to be very dense clouds. However, the l-v
diagram of the clouds traced by CO is quite different from that of our SPH
simulation, being more similar to that obtained from simulations using
collisionless particles. The $l-v$ diagram of a mixture of collisional and
collisionless particles gives better reproduction of the kinematic structures
of the GC clouds observed in the CO line. The fact that the kinematics of HCN
clouds can be reproduced by the SPH particles suggests that the dense clouds in
the GC are formed via cloud collisions induced by rotating bar.

Simulations of ISOCAM data allow us to test the photometric accuracy and
completeness of the reduction. We detect 49 objects in the ISO-HDF at high
confidence level, 42 in the LW3 filter, 3 in the LW2 filter, and 4 in both

89 are detected at 15 microns only, 7 at 6.75 microns only and 4 in both

in the LW3 band. On the contrary, the number of sources in the LW2 band is
compatible with the prediction of such a model, but with greater uncertainties,
given the small number of detections.

Title:The Three-Dimensional Mass Distribution in NGC 1700,"
Abstract:  A variety of modeling techniques is used with surface photometry from the
literature and recently acquired high-accuracy stellar kinematic data to
constrain the three-dimensional mass distribution in the luminous cuspy
elliptical galaxy NGC 1700. First, we model the radial velocity field and
photometry, and, using a Bayesian technique, estimate the triaxiality T and
short-to-long axis ratio c in five concentric annuli between approximately 1
and 3 effective radii. The results are completely consistent with T being
constant inside about 2.5 r_e (36 arcsec; 6.7/h kpc). Adding an assumption of
constant T as prior information gives an upper limit of T < 0.16 (95%
confidence); this relaxes to T < 0.22 if it is also assumed that there is
perfect alignment between the angular momentum and the galaxy's intrinsic short
axis. Near axisymmetry permits us then to use axisymmetric models to constrain
the radial mass profile. Using the Jeans (moment) equations, we demonstrate
that 2-integral, constant-M/L models cannot fit the data; but a 2-integral
model in which the cumulative enclosed M/L increases by a factor of roughly 2
from the center out to 12/h kpc can. Three-integral models constructed by
quadratic programming show that, in fact, no constant-M/L model is consistent
with the kinematics. Anisotropic 3-integral models with variable M/L, while not
uniquely establishing a minimum acceptable halo mass, imply, as do the moment
models, a cumulative M/L_B approximately 10 h at 12/h kpc. We conclude that NGC
1700 represents the best stellar dynamical evidence to date for dark matter in
elliptical galaxies.

Title:Envelope structure of deeply embedded young stellar objects in the Serpens Molecular Cloud,"
Abstract:  Aperture synthesis and single-dish (sub) millimeter molecular lines and
continuum observations reveal in great detail the envelope structure of deeply
embedded young stellar objects (SMM1, SMM2, SMM3, SMM4) in the densely
star-forming Serpens Molecular Cloud. Resolved millimeter continuum emission
constrains the density structure to a radial power law with index -2.0 +/- 0.5,
and envelope masses of 8.7, 3.0, and 5.3 M_sol for SMM1, SMM3, and SMM4. The
core SMM2 does not seem to have a central condensation and may not have formed
a star yet. The molecular line observations can be described by the same
envelope model, if an additional, small amount of warm (100 K) material is
included. This probably corresponds to the inner few hundred AU of the envelope
were the temperature is high. In the interferometer beam, the molecular lines
reveal the inner regions of the envelopes, as well as interaction of the
outflow with the surrounding envelope. Bright HCO+ and HCN emission outlines
the cavities, while SiO and SO trace the direct impact of the outflow on
ambient gas. Taken together, these observations provide a first comprehensive
view of the physical and chemical structure of the envelopes of deeply embedded
young stellar objects in a clustered environment on scales between 1000 and
10,000 AU.

Title:The Effect of Self-gravity of Gas on Gas Fueling in Barred Galaxies with a Supermassive Black Hole,"
Abstract:  In our previous paper, we have shown that a gas disk in the nuclear region of
a barred galaxy which contains a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) rapidly
evolves into a nuclear gas ring by the effect of an additional inner Lindblad
resonance caused by the SMBH. In this paper, we investigate the fate of the gas
ring, involving self-gravity of gas, using two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations. We find that the gas ring becomes gravitationally unstable for a
gas surface density of gas above a critical value, and fragments into several
gas clumps. Some denser clumps increase their mass via the accretion of the
surrounding gas and collisions with other clumps, and finally a very massive
gas clump (10^7 M_sun) is formed. Due to the torque from the most massive
clump, a part of the gas in the ring loses its angular momentum and falls into
the galactic center. As a result, a nuclear gas disk (50 pc) is formed around
the SMBH. The accretion rate for $R<50$ pc attains about 1 M_sun/yr for
3.5*10^7 yr. At the final phase of the bar-driven fueling, self-gravity is
crucial for the angular momentum transfer of the gas. This is a new mechanism
for gas fueling to the vicinity of the SMBH.

Title:Spectroscopy of MACHO 97-SMC-1: self-lensing within the SMC,"
Abstract:  More than a dozen microlensing events have been detected so far towards the
LMC and 2 towards the SMC. If all the lenses are in the Galactic halo, both the
LMC and the SMC events are expected to have similar time scales. However, the
first event towards the SMC, MACHO 97-SMC-1, had a time scale of 123 days which
is much larger than the typical time scale for the LMC events. From optical
depth estimates, we first show that the stars within the SMC play a dominant
role as gravitational lenses and can fully account for the observed
microlensing events, mainly due to its large physical depth. We also show that
if the lenses are within the Magellanic Clouds, then the SMC events should be
longer in duration than the LMC events, a fact that is consistent with the
observations. The time scale of the event implies that the mass of the lens is
>2 solar masses if it is in the Milky Way disk or halo, in which case the lens
is expected to be bright and should reveal itself in the spectrum. Here, we
present an optical spectrum of MACHO 97-SMC-1 which shows that the lens is not
in the Milky Way disk or halo, but is a low-mass star within the SMC. It is
worth noting here that MACHO SMC-98-1 is the only OTHER observed event towards
the SMC. This was a binary lens event where the caustic crossing time-scale as
observed by PLANET, MACHO, EROS and OGLE collaborations, suggests that the lens
is within the SMC. Furthermore, the only LMC event where the location of the
lens is known is the binary lens event MACHO LMC-9, for which the lens is also
within the LMC. Thus, ALL the 3 microlensing events towards the Magellanic
Clouds for which we have independent knowledge of the location of the lenses
are due to self-lensing within the Magellanic Clouds.

Title:Review: Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution with Long Wavelength Observations,"
Abstract:  It is well established in the local Universe that regions of high
star-formation rate are dusty. As a result of this physical causal link,
galaxies of increasing current star formation activity emit a larger proportion
of their bolometric luminosity via dust absorption and re-radiation in the
thermal mid- to far-infrared. Several new observations indicate that this trend
continues back to earlier cosmic times, when star formation rates were very
high, and a large fraction of the resulting UV power was reprocessed by dust
into the infrared. For studying the more luminous, (and therefore more dusty)
galaxies, infrared spectroscopy is crucial even at moderate redshifts. For the
less dusty galaxies, we are still driven strongly to longer wavelengths as
their redshifts increase from 5 to 10. On the observational side, infrared
astronomy is about to start catching up with optical astronomy in sensitivity,
spatial resolution and field-of-view. Therefore, long-wavelength observations
will play the key role in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution
in the ``Immature Universe.""

progenitor main-sequence stars M_ms from the abundance patterns of extremely
metal-poor stars with a procedure recently proposed by Shigeyama and Tsujimoto
(1998). The ejected masses of alpha- and iron-group elements increase with
M_ms, whereas more Eu is ejected from supernovae with lower M_ms. For these
several heavy elements, it is shown that the average abundance ratios weighted
by the Salpeter initial mass function coincide with the ratios observed in
stars with -2<[Fe/H]<-1 within 0.1 dex. It follows that the correlations of
stellar abundance ratios with the metallicity are twofold. One is the abundance
ratios for [Fe/H] <-2.5 imprinted by the nucleosynthesis in individual
supernovae on the timescale 10^7yr and the other for [Fe/H]>-2 results from the
mixing of the products from a whole site of the nucleosynthesis, taking place

Abstract:  Multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the post-bounce evolution of
collapsed stellar iron cores have demonstrated that convective overturn between
the stalled shock and the neutrinosphere can have an important effect on the
neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. Whether a model yields a successful
explosion or not, however, still depends on the power of neutrino energy
deposition behind the stalled shock. The neutrino interaction with the stellar
gas in the ``hot bubble'' also determines the duration of the shock stagnation
phase, the explosion energy, and the composition of the neutrino-heated
supernova ejecta. More accurate models require a more precise calculation of
the neutrino luminosities and spectra and of the angular distributions of the
neutrinos in the heating region. Therefore it is necessary to improve the
numerical treatment of the neutrino transport, to develop a better
understanding of the neutrino opacities of the dense nuclear medium, and to

Abstract:  Studies of the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) and other deep surveys have revealed
an apparent peak in the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity density, and therefore the
star-formation rate density, of the Universe at redshifts 1<z<2. We use
photometric redshifts of galaxies in the HDF to determine the comoving UV
luminosity density and find that, when errors (in particular, sampling error)
are properly accounted for, a flat distribution is statistically
indistinguishable from a distribution peaked at z~1.5. Furthermore, we examine
the effects of cosmological surface brightness (SB) dimming on these
measurements by applying a uniform SB cut to all galaxy fluxes after correcting
them to redshift z=5. We find that, comparing all galaxies at the same
intrinsic surface brightness sensitivity, the UV luminosity density contributed
by high intrinsic SB regions increases by almost two orders of magnitude from
z~0 to z~5. This suggests that there exists a population of objects with very
high star formation rates at high redshifts that apparently do not exist at low
redshifts. The peak of star formation, then, likely occurs somewhere beyond
z>2.

Abstract:  We are reviewing the power of Doppler tomography for detailed investigations

high-resolution spectroscopy in combination with tomography as analytic tool,
the structure and extent of the accretion flows and accretion curtains in the

mass-donating secondary stars can be made visible. In addition we show, how
basic system parameters like the binary inclination and the mass ratio can be
addressed by tomography.

"Title:Measuring the three-dimensional shear from simulation data, with applications to weak gravitational lensing","
Abstract:  We have developed a new three-dimensional algorithm, based on the standard
P$^3$M method, for computing deflections due to weak gravitational lensing. We
compare the results of this method with those of the two-dimensional planar
approach, and rigorously outline the conditions under which the two approaches
are equivalent. Our new algorithm uses a Fast Fourier Transform convolution
method for speed, and has a variable softening feature to provide a realistic
interpretation of the large-scale structure in a simulation. The output values
of the code are compared with those from the Ewald summation method, which we
describe and develop in detail. With an optimal choice of the high frequency
filtering in the Fourier convolution, the maximum errors, when using only a
single particle, are about 7 per cent, with an rms error less than 2 per cent.
For ensembles of particles, used in typical $N$-body simulations, the rms
errors are typically 0.3 per cent. We describe how the output from the
algorithm can be used to generate distributions of magnification, source
ellipticity, shear and convergence for large-scale structure.

Abstract:  We derive an equation of state (EOS) for strange matter, starting from an

confinement at zero baryon density and deconfinement at high density and (iii)

Title:Cluster vs. Field Elliptical Galaxies and Clues on their Formation,"
Abstract:  Using new observations for a sample of 931 early-type galaxies we investigate
whether the \mg2--\so relation shows any dependence on the local environment.
The galaxies have been assigned to three different environments depending on
the local overdensity: clusters, groups, and field, having used our
completeredshift database to guide the assignment of galaxies. It is found that
cluster, group and field early-type galaxies follow almost identical \mg2--\so\
relations, with the largest \mg2 zero-point difference (clusters minus field)
being only $0.007\pm 0.002$ mag. No correlation of the residuals is found with
the morphological type or the bulge to disk ratio. Using stellar population
models in a differential fashion, this small zero-point difference implies a
luminosity-weighted age difference of only $\sim 1$ Gyr between the
corresponding stellar populations, with field galaxies being younger. The
mass-weighted age difference could be significantly smaller, if minor events of
late star formation took place preferentially in field galaxies. We combine
these results with the existing evidence for the bulk of stars in cluster
early-type galaxies having formed at very high redshift, and conclude that the
bulk of stars in galactic spheroids had to form at high redshifts ($z\gsim 3$),
no matter whether such spheroids now reside in low or high density regions. The
cosmological implications of these findings are briefly discussed.

Title:Constraints on Disks Models of The Big Blue Bump from UV/Optical/IR Observations,"
Abstract:  Optical/UV observations provide many constraints on accretion disk models of
AGN which aren't always appreciated by modelers of the X-ray emission (or
sometimes even of the optical/UV emission). The spectral behavior at the Ly
edge, the polarization, the continuum slopes and breaks, and the variability
timescales and phasing all conflict with simple models and strongly constrain
the more Baroque ones. Partial-covering absorbers and microlensing data suggest
that the radiation is not released simply according to where the potential drop
(modified by standard viscous transport) takes place. On the other hand, the
orientation-based unified model is in accord with the K-\alpha inclination
distributions for the AGN spectral classes, basing the latter on the limited
existing data and theoretical understanding.

Abstract:  We present results of a study of very low mass halo stars. Using a sample of
proper motion stars identified from plate material taken as part of the first

distribution, and kinematics of the Population II M subdwarfs. Our overall
luminosity function is in good agreement with previous analyses of the space
density of nearby very-low-mass halo subdwarfs, and confirms the discrepancy
between local analyses and the space densities inferred from deep HST
starcounts. We show for the first time that both the metallicity distribution
and kinematics of late-type halo subdwarfs are consistent with those of their
higher mass metal-poor counterparts. Dividing our sample by abundance, we find
no evidence that the mass function of field halo stars is dependent upon

Title:Reflected Spectra and Albedos of Extrasolar Giant Planets I: Clear and Cloudy Atmospheres,"
Abstract:  The reflected spectra of extrasolar giant planets are primarily influenced by
Rayleigh scattering, molecular absorption, and atmospheric condensates. We
present model geometric albedo and phase integral spectra and Bond albedos for
planets and brown dwarfs with masses between 0.8 and 70 Jupiter masses.
Rayleigh scattering predominates in the blue while molecular absorption removes
most red and infrared photons. Thus cloud-free atmospheres, found on giant
planets with effective temperatures exceeding about 400 K, are quite dark in
reflected light beyond 0.6 microns. In cooler atmospheres first water clouds
and then other condensates provide a bright reflecting layer. Only planets with
cloudy atmospheres will be detectable in reflected light beyond 1 micron.
Thermal emission dominates the near-infrared for warm objects with clear
atmospheres. However the presence of other condensates, not considered here,
may brighten some planets in reflected near-infrared light and darken them in
the blue and UV. Bond albedos, the ratio of the total reflected to incident
power, are sensitive to the spectral type of the primary. Most incident photons
from early type stars will be Rayleigh scattered, while most incident photons
from late type stars will be absorbed. The Bond albedo of a given planet thus
may range from 0.4 to 0.05, depending on the primary type. Condensation of a
water cloud increases the Bond albedo of a given planet by up to a factor of
two. The spectra of cloudy planets are strongly influenced by poorly
constrained cloud microphysical properties, particularly particle size and
supersaturation. Both Bond and geometric albedos are comparatively less
sensitive to variations in planet mass and effective temperature.

Title:Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and Active-Sterile Neutrino Mixing: Evidence for Maximal Mu Neutrino <-> Tau Neutrino Mixing in Super Kamiokande?,"
Abstract:  We discuss Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on maximal
$\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$ mixing. Vacuum $\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$
oscillation has been proposed as one possible explanation of the Super
Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data. Based on the most recent primordial
abundance measurements, we find that the effective number of neutrino species
for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is $N_\nu\la 3.3$. Assuming that all three
active neutrinos are light (with masses $\ll 1$ MeV), we examine BBN
constraints on $\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$ mixing in two scenarios: (1) a
negligible lepton asymmetry (the standard picture); (2) the presence of a large
lepton asymmetry which has resulted from an amplification by
$\nu_\tau\leftrightarrow\nu_{s'}$ mixing ($\nu_{s'}$ being $\nu_s$ or another
sterile neutrino species). The latter scenario has been proposed recently to
reconcile the BBN constraints and large-angle $\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$
mixing. We find that the large-angle $\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$ mixing in
the first scenario, which would yield $N_\nu\approx 4$, is ruled out as an
explanation of the Super Kamiokande data. It is conceivably possible for the
$\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$ solution to evade BBN bounds in the second
scenario, but only if 200 eV$^2\la m^2_{\nu_\tau}-m^2_{\nu_{s'}}\la 10^4$
eV$^2$ is satisfied, and if $\nu_\tau$ decays non-radiatively with a lifetime
$\la 10^3$ years. This mass-squared difference implies 15 eV$\la
m_{\nu_\tau}\la 100$ eV if $\nu_{s'}$ is much lighter than $\nu_\tau$. We
conclude that maximal (or near maximal) $\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_\tau$ mixing
is a more likely explanation of the Super Kamiokande data.

Title:A New Dark Matter Candidate: Non-thermal Sterile Neutrinos,"
Abstract:  We propose a new and unique dark matter candidate: $\sim 100$ eV to $\sim 10$
keV sterile neutrinos produced via lepton number-driven resonant MSW
(Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein) conversion of active neutrinos. The requisite
lepton number asymmetries in any of the active neutrino flavors range from
10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{-1}$ of the photon number - well within primordial
nucleosynthesis bounds. The unique feature here is that the adiabaticity
condition of the resonance strongly favors the production of lower energy
sterile neutrinos. The resulting non-thermal (cold) energy spectrum can cause
these sterile neutrinos to revert to non-relativistic kinematics at an early
epoch, so that free-streaming lengths at or below the dwarf galaxy scale are
possible. Therefore, the main problem associated with light neutrino dark
matter candidates can be circumvented in our model.

Abstract:  Of all known persistent stellar-mass black hole candidates, only LMC X-1 and

component. We present results from long (170ksec) Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) observations of LMC X-1 and LMC X-3 made in 1996 December. The spectra
can be described by a multicolor disk blackbody plus an additional high-energy
power-law. Even though the spectra are very soft (Gamma is about 2.5), RXTE
detected a significant signal from LMC X-3 up to energies of 50keV, the hardest
energy at which the object was ever detected.
Focusing on LMC X-3, we present results from the first year of an ongoing
monitoring campaign with RXTE which started in 1997 January. We show that the
appearance of the object changes considerably over its ~200d long cycle. This
variability can either be explained by periodic changes in the mass transfer
rate or by a precessing accretion disk analogous to Her X-1.

Abstract:  Be abundances of old, low metallicity halo stars have major implications on
cosmic-ray origin, requiring acceleration out of fresh supernova ejecta. The
observed, essentially constant Be/Fe fixes the Be production per SNII, allowing
the determination of the energy supplied to cosmic rays per SNII. The results
rule out acceleration out of the metal-poor ISM, and favor Be production at all
epochs of Galactic evolution by cosmic rays having the same spectrum and source
composition as those at the current epoch. Individual supernova acceleration of
its own nucleosynthetic products and the collective acceleration by SN shocks

for such origin. The supernova acceleration efficiency is about 2% for the
refractory metals and 10% for all the cosmic rays.

Abstract:  Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption systems at $z \sim 3$ with $N_{HI} \ga 3 \times
10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ have been found to be enriched with a mean metallicity of
$Z/Z_{\odot} \sim 10^{-2.5}$, and a large scatter in the metallicity. It is
reasonable to assume that the process of initial enrichment of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z \ga 3$ also produced dust grains. We explore
the implications of the presence of dust grains in the IGM at high redshift, in
particular, the contribution of photoelectric emission from grains by hard
background photons to the net heating rate of the IGM.
We show that (i) the charge on dust particles and the characteristics of
photo-emitted electrons differ substantially from those in the interstellar
medium (ISM) in several respects: a) grains are exposed to and charged by
photons beyond the Lyman limit, and b) because of this, the photoelectrons have
typical energy of tens of eV. We also show that ii) silicates are more
efficient heating agents than graphites; iii) small grains contribute mostly to
the net heating; iv) at densities typical of the IGM at $z\sim 3$ and for
Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers, dust heating can be comparable or exceed
photoionization heating within an order of magnitude; v) this increases the
temperature of overdense regions, compared to the case of no dust heating, by
factor of $\sim 2$. We discuss the implications of this extra heating source in
Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbing systems.

show polarization as high as 7--8% and high reddening. This optical reddening

solar luminosity constraint we derive that $\Phi_\nu(hep)/S_{13}$ cannot exceed
the SSM estimate by more than a factor three. If one makes the additional
hypothesis that $hep$ neutrino production occurs where the $^3$He concentration
is at equilibrium, helioseismology gives an upper bound which is (less then)
two times the SSM prediction. We argue that the anomalous $hep$-neutrino flux
of order of that observed by Superkamiokande cannot be explained by

H(r,p,t) = p^2/2 + U(r,t), with U=R(t)V(r) or U=V[R(t)r], where V(r) is a
polynomial in x, y, and/or z, and R = const * t^p is a time-dependent scale
factor. When p is not too negative, one can distinguish between regular and
chaotic behaviour by determining whether an orbit segment exhibits a sensitive
dependence on initial conditions. However, chaotic segments in these potentials
differ from chaotic segments in time-independent potentials in that a small
initial perturbation will usually exhibit a sub- or super-exponential growth in
time. Although not periodic, regular segments typically exhibit simpler shapes,
topologies, and Fourier spectra than do chaotic segments. This distinction
between regular and chaotic behaviour is not absolute since a single orbit
segment can seemingly change from regular to chaotic and visa versa. All these
observed phenomena can be understood in terms of a simple theoretical model.

Abstract:  The degree of beaming in Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is currently unknown. The
uncertainty in the gamma-ray beaming angle, theta, leaves the total energy
release (proportional to theta^2) and the event rate per galaxy (proportional
to 1/theta^2) unknown to within orders of magnitude. Since the delayed radio
emission of GRB sources originates from a mildly relativistic shock and
receives only weak relativistic beaming, the rate of radio-selected transients
with no GRB counterpart can be used to set an upper limit on 1/theta^2. We find
that a VLA survey with a sensitivity of 0.1 mJy at 10 GHz could identify more
than 2e4/(theta/10degrees)^2 radio afterglows across the sky if each source is
sampled at least twice over a period of one month or longer. From the total
number of >0.1 mJy sources observed at 8.44 GHz and the fraction of fading

Abstract:  The BL Lac object Mkn~421 was observed three times by the X-ray observatory
BeppoSAX in consecutive days during 1997 April and May. The source was in a
quiescent state, with an average 2-10 keV flux of 9.0 x 10^(-11) erg/cm/cm/s.
Flux variation by a factor of ~2 on timescales as short as a few 10 ks were
more pronounced in the hard (i.e. above ~3 keV) than in the soft X-rays. The
broadband (0.1-40 keV) spectrum is concave and can be most easily explained
with a power-law model which steepens gradually with energy. In this framework,
neither photoabsorption edges nor resonant absorption lines are required,
strengthening the case against the ubiquity of such features in BL Lac objects,
which had been previously suggested by Einstein observations. The broadband
spectrum hardens with hard X-ray flux, mostly due to a flattening above ~4 keV.
This suggests that the relativistic highest energy electron distribution
properties drive the X-ray spectral dynamics: either a stratification of the
distribution in the jet with energy or inhomogeneities in the electron
injection mechanism could be consistent with the observed variability pattern.

accuracy of 1.5%; systematic errors may be greater than this. This analysis
uncertainty must be incorporated when attempting to make high accuracy

Abstract:  We summarise the main results obtained over the last two years by the ESO
Slice Project (ESP) redshift survey, concerning the luminosity function and
mean density of galaxies, and their implications for the galaxy number counts
at bright magnitudes. The bj-band luminosity function is characterised by a
steep faint-end, which raises above a ""global"" Schechter fit for M_bj > -17 +
5log(h) and is well described by a power-law with slope ~ -1.6. This steepening
is mostly produced by galaxies with emission lines, with a clear trend for
galaxies with larger [OII] equivalent widths to show a steeper faint end (and a
fainter M*). The normalization of the luminosity function is about a factor of
1.6 higher that that from the Stromlo-APM survey. We find that, in fact, the
mean density can be seen to increase out to ~140/h Mpc. If we take this into
account when computing the expected cumulative number counts from the observed
luminosity function, we are able to reproduce the observed steep counts at
bright (bj<17) magnitudes very accurately.

Title:The Redshift and Real-Space Correlation Functions from the ESP Galaxy Redshift Survey,"
Abstract:  We discuss the behaviour of the redshift- and real-space correlation
functions from the ESO Slice Project (ESP) galaxy redshift survey. xi(s) for
the whole survey is positive out to ~80/h Mpc, with a smooth break from a
shallow power law. Comparison to xi(s) from two other wide-angle, moderately
deep surveys, the LCRS and Stromlo-APM, shows a very good agreement of all data
sets, despite the different selections and geometries. By projecting xi(r_p,
pi), we recover the real--space correlation function xi(r), which below 10/h
Mpc is reasonably well described by a power law xi(r) = (r/r_o)^{-\gamma} with
r_o=4.15^{+0.20}_{-0.21} /h Mpc and \gamma=1.67^{+0.07}_{-0.09}. The same
analysis, applied to four volume-limited subsamples, evidences a small but
significant growth of clustering with luminosity (r_o varies from 3.4 to 5.2/h
Mpc when the luminosity threshold is increased from -18. to -20).

Title:Measuring Dark Matter Power Spectrum from Cosmic Microwave Background,"
Abstract:  We propose a method to extract the projected power spectrum of density
perturbations from the distortions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
The distortions are imprinted onto the CMB by the gravitational lensing effect
and can be extracted using a combination of products of CMB derivatives. We
show that future CMB experiments such as Planck will be able to extract the
power spectrum with high statistical significance over two orders of magnitude
in angle. The method proposed here traces dark matter directly to higher
redshift (up to $z \sim 1100$) and larger scale (few Gpc) than any other
currently known method. It also traces large scale structure in the linear
regime, allowing simple interpretation in terms of cosmological models. By
providing additional and complementary information to the one from the primary
CMB analysis it will strengthen further the scientific return of future CMB
experiments.

Title:Theoretical Tools for Large Scale Structure,"
Abstract:  We review the main theoretical aspects of the structure formation paradigm
which impinge upon wide angle surveys: the early universe generation of
gravitational metric fluctuations from quantum noise in scalar inflaton fields;
the well understood and computed linear regime of CMB anisotropy and large
scale structure (LSS) generation; the weakly nonlinear regime, where higher
order perturbation theory works well, and where the cosmic web picture
operates, describing an interconnected LSS of clusters bridged by filaments,
with membranes as the intrafilament webbing. Current CMB+LSS data favour the
simplest inflation-based $\Lambda$CDM models, with a primordial spectral index
within about 5% of scale invariant and $\Omega_\Lambda \approx 2/3$, similar to
that inferred from SNIa observations, and with open CDM models strongly
disfavoured. The attack on the nonlinear regime with a variety of N-body and
gas codes is described, as are the excursion set and peak-patch semianalytic
approaches to object collapse. The ingredients are mixed together in an
illustrative gasdynamical simulation of dense supercluster formation.

effects due to the small scale virialized objects, such as galaxies and
clusters of galaxies. We consider a simple model of an inhomogeneous universe.
The matter distribution in the universe is modeled by randomly distributed
isothermal objects. We found that, for the majority of the random lines of
sight, the Weyl focusing has no significant effect and the image magnification
of a point like source within redshift of 5 is dominated by the Ricci focusing.

"Title:Star formation and the interstellar medium in low surface brightness galaxies. III. Why they are blue, thin and poor in molecular gas","
Abstract:  We present N-body simulations of Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies and
their Interstellar Medium to investigate the cause for their low star formation
rates (SFR).Due to their massive halos, stellar disks of LSB galaxies are very
stable and thin. Lack of dust makes the projected edge-on surface brightness of
LSB galaxies comparable to the projected edge-on surface brightness of
dust-rich High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies of similar size.
We show that the low surface densities found in LSB galaxies are by
themselves not enough to explain the slow evolution of LSB galaxies. A low
metal content of the gas is essential. As a consequence the gas cools
inefficiently, resulting in an almost negligible cold gas fraction. We show
that LSB galaxies must have molecular gas fractions of less than 5 percent.
Our best model has a SFR which is on average low but fluctuates strongly.
This causes the large spread in colors of LSB galaxies. From a distribution of
birthrate parameters we conclude that the presently-known and modeled gas-rich
blue LSB galaxies constitute the majority of the total population of gas-rich
LSB disk galaxies. We deduce the existence of an additional red, quiescent and
gas-rich population which constitutes less than 20 percent of the total
population. This does not rule out the existence of a large number of gas-poor
LSB galaxies. These must however have had an evolutionary history dramatically
different from that of the gas-rich galaxies.

Title:Enhanced Star Formation in Seyfert 2 Galaxies,"
Abstract:  In this paper, we report our preliminary results on enhanced star formation
activity in Seyfert 2 galaxies. By re-analysing the Tully-Fisher relation for
Whittle(1992)'s sample and for a Seyfert 2s' sample selecting from Veron-Cetty
& Veron (1996), we find that (1) almost all Seyfert 2 galaxies with
circumnuclear star formation have a ratio of far infrared (FIR) to blue
luminosities ($L_{FIR}/L_{B}$) to be larger than 1/3; (2) for Seyfert 2
galaxies with $L_{FIR}/L_{B} < 1/3$, the Tully-Fisher relation is similar to
that of the normal spiral galaxies; while for those with $\rm L_{FIR}/L_{B}
\geq 1/3 $, they are significantly different from the normal ones, which
confirms Whittle's suggestion of enhanced star formation activities in the
circumnuclear regions of these Seyfert 2 galaxies.

Title:New Infrared Seyfert Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We present optical spectra for new infrared Seyfert galaxies obtained with
the 2.16m telescope at Beijing Astronomical Observatory (BAO). After wavelength
and flux calibration, they are classified by the degree of nuclear activity:
nine Seyfert 2 and three Seyfert 3 galaxies. In addition, by using the data
from de Grijp et al.(1992), we find that (1) there exists a tight correlation
between luminosities of far-infrared ($L_{FIR}$) and \Ha ($L_{H\alpha}$) for
both Seyfert and HII-like (starburst) galaxies; (2) the median value of \Ha
luminosities of Seyfert 1s is one magnitude larger than that of Seyfert 2s and
starburst galaxies; (3) the cumulative distributions of FIR luminosities and
infrared spectral index $\alpha(100,60)$ for Seyfert 1s and 2s are similar to
that of starburst galaxies. We conclude that most of the far-infrared emission
from Seyfert 2 galaxies is due to the violent nuclear/circumnuclear starburst,
rather than the nonthermal activity in the nucleus, this may also be the case
for many Seyfert 1s as well.

Title:NGC 3079: X-ray emission from the nuclear super-bubble and halo,"
Abstract:  We report the results of the spatial and spectral analysis of the ROSAT HRI
and PSPC observations of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 3079. We detected
several sources in the field of NGC 3079 with both PSPC and HRI, and complex
emission from the inner 5' around NGC 3079. We have identified possible
counterparts for several of the sources outside NGC 3079 by comparison with
optical plates and catalogues.
The X-ray emission from NGC 3079 has a Lx = 3E40 erg/sec and can be resolved
into the following three components: (i) Extended emission in the innermost
region, with Lx = 1E40 erg/sec, coincident with the super-bubble seen in
optical images. The active nucleus may contribute to the emission as a point
source. (ii) Emission from the disk of the galaxy, with Lx = 7E39 erg/sec, that
can be partly resolved by the HRI in 3 point-like sources with luminosities of
\~6E38erg/sec each. (iii) Very soft X-shaped emission from the halo, with Lx =
6E39 erg/sec, extending to a diameter of 27 kpc.
The X-ray luminosity of NGC 3079 is higher by a factor of 10 compared to
other galaxies of similar optical luminosity and we argue that this may be
caused by the presence of an AGN rather than by starburst activity. The
influence of the AGN on the companion galaxies in the NGC 3079 group are
discussed.

Title:ASCA Observation of the Galactic Jet Source XTE J0421+560 (CI Cam) in Outburst,"
Abstract:  We observed the newly discovered Galactic jet source XTE J0421+560 (= CI Cam)
with ASCA from 1998 April 3.3 to April 4.1 (UT), three days after the beginning
of the outburst. The X-ray intensity in the 1-10 keV band gradually decreased
with an e-folding time of about 30 hours; the decline was accompanied by
spectral softening. Two flare-like intensity enhancements were detected below 1
keV. We could fit the average spectrum above 0.8 keV with a two-temperature
model (5.7 and 1.1 keV) of thermal emission from an optically thin
ionization-equilibrium plasma. The broad iron-K profile, however, requires an
extra emission line at 6.4 keV, or Doppler broadening (or both). The former can
be explained in terms of reflection from cold matter, while the latter can be
attributed to emission from the twin jets. In both cases, the time evolution of
the emission measure and of the temperature are difficult to explain by
emission from a single plasma, suggesting that heat input and/or injection of
material was occurring during the outburst.

Abstract:  The formation of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) provides a
very powerful probe of the early universe at the epoch of recombination.
Specifically, it is possible to constrain the variation of fundamental physical
constants in the early universe. We have calculated the effect of a varying
electromagnetic coupling constant (\alpha) on the CMBR and find that new
satellite experiments should provide a tight constraint on the value of \alpha
at recombination which is complementary to existing constraints. An estimate of
the obtainable precision is |\dot{\alpha}/\alpha| \leq 7 x 10^{-13} y^{-1} in a

Title:Wavelength limits on isobaricity of perturbations in a thermally unstable radiatively cooling medium,"
Abstract:  Nonlinear evolution of one-dimensional planar perturbations in an optically
thin radiatively cooling medium in the long-wavelength limit is studied
numerically. The accepted cooling function generates in thermal equilibrium a
bistable equation of state $P(\rho)$. The unperturbed state is taken close to
the upper (low-density) unstable state with infinite compressibility
($dP/d\rho= 0$). The evolution is shown to proceed in three different stages.
At first stage, pressure and density set in the equilibrium equation of state,
and velocity profile steepens gradually as in case of pressure-free flows. At
second stage, those regions of the flow where anomalous pressure (i.e. with
negative compressibility) holds, create velocity profile more sharp than in
pressure-free case, which in turn results in formation of a very narrow
(short-wavelength) region where gas separates the equilibrium equation of state
and pressure equilibrium sets in rapidly. On this stage, variation in pressure
between narrow dense region and extended environment does not exceed more than
0.01 of the unperturbed value. On third stage, gas in the short-wavelength
region reaches the second (high-density) stable state, and pressure balance
establishes through the flow with pressure equal to the one in the unperturbed
state. In external (long-wavelength) regions, gas forms slow isobaric inflow
toward the short-wavelength layer. The duration of these stages decreases when
the ratio of the acoustic time to the radiative cooling time increases. Limits
in which nonlinear evolution of thermally unstable long-wavelength
perturbations develops in isobaric regime are obtained.

Title:Warm absorbers in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies,"
Abstract:  Warm absorbers are an important new tool for investigating the conditions
within the central regions of active galaxies. They have been observed in ~50%
of the well-studied Seyfert galaxies and have also been detected in quite a
number of Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1). Here, we present a study of
the X-ray properties of several NLSy1s with focus on their warm absorbers: (a)
An analysis of all ROSAT PSPC observations of NGC 4051 including new ones is
performed, which reveals variability by a factor ~30 in count rate and much
less variability in the warm absorber parameters. (b) The possibility of a
dusty warm absorber in IRAS 13349+2438 is explored on the basis of
photoionization models for dusty warm gas and explicit ROSAT spectral fits. (c)
The X-ray spectrum of the NLSy1 1E0117.2-2837 is analyzed. It can be
successfully described by a very steep powerlaw of photon index G_x = -4, or
alternatively by a warm-absorbed flat powerlaw. UV-EUV emission lines expected
to arise from the warm material are predicted. (d) The strong spectral
variability of RX J0134.3-4258 (from G_x = -4.4 in the ROSAT survey
observation, to ~ -2.2$ in our subsequent pointing) is examined in terms of
warm absorption.

Title:Stellar Metallicities and SNIa Rates in the Early-type Galaxy NGC5846 from ROSAT and ASCA Observations,"
Abstract:  In this paper we analyze the diffuse X-ray coronae surrounding the elliptical
galaxy NGC5846, combining measurements from two observatories, ROSAT and ASCA.
We map the gas temperature distribution and find a central cool region within
an approximately isothermal gas halo extending to a radius of about 50 kpc, and
evidence for a temperature decrease at larger radii. With a radially falling
temperature profile, the total mass converges to 9.6+/-1.0 10^12 Msun at ~230
kpc radius. Using the spectroscopic measurements, we also derive radial
distributions for the heavy elements silicon and iron and find that the
abundances of both decrease with galaxy radius. The mass ratio of Si to Fe lies
between the theoretical predictions for element production in SN Ia and SN II,
suggesting an important role for SN Ia, as well as SN II, for gas enrichment in
ellipticals. Using the SN Ia yield of Si, we set an upper limit of 0.012 SNU
for the SN Ia rate at radii >50 kpc, which is independent of possible
uncertainties in the iron L-shell modeling. We compare our observations with
the theoretical predictions for the chemical evolution of ellipticals, taken
from Matteucci & Gibson (1995). We conclude that the metal content in stars, if
explained by the star formation duration, requires a significant decline in the
duration of star formation with galaxy radius, ranging from ~1 Gyr at the
center to ~0.01 Gyr at 100 kpc radius. Alternatively, the decline in
metallicity with galaxy radius may be caused by a similar drop with radius in
the efficiency of star formation. Based on the Si and Fe measurements presented
in this paper, we conclude that the latter scenario is preferred, unless a
dependence of the SN Ia rate on stellar metallicity is invoked. (Abridged).

increasing liminocity due to radiational braking of the accretion flow.

Abstract:  We detected with the IRAM interferometer the lines of CO(4-3) and CO(9-8)
from the recently-discovered broad absorption line quasar APM 08279+5255. The
molecular lines are at a redshift of 3.911, which we take to be the true
cosmological redshift of the quasar's host galaxy. This means the quasar
emission lines at z=3.87 are blueshifted by a kinematic component of -2500
km/s, and, along with the broad absorption lines, are probably emitted in the
quasar's wind or jet, moving toward us. The CO line ratios suggest the
molecular gas is at a temperature of about 200 K, at a density of about 4000
cm^-3. We also detected the dust emission at 94 and 214 GHz (emitted
wavelengths 650 and 290 microns). The spectral index of the mm/submm continuum
is +3.2, indicating the dust emission is optically thin in this part of the
spectrum. The extremely high CO and dust luminosities suggest magnification by
gravitational lensing. Using the optical extent and our limit on the size of
the CO region, we estimate a magnification of 7 to 30 for the CO lines and the
far-IR continuum, and 14 to 60 for the optical/UV. In this interpretation, the
molecular gas and dust is in a nuclear disk of radius 90 to 270 pc around the

Title:Accretion Disc Theory: From the Standard Model Until Advection,"
Abstract:  Accretion disc theory was first developed as a theory with the local heat
balance, where the whole energy produced by a viscous heating was emitted to
the sides of the disc. One of the most important new invention of this theory
was a phenomenological treatment of the turbulent viscosity, known as ''alpha''
prescription, when the (r$\phi$) component of the stress tensor was
approximated by ($\alpha$ P) with a unknown constant $\alpha$. This
prescription played the role in the accretion disc theory as well important as
the mixing-length theory of convection for stellar evolution. Sources of
turbulence in the accretion disc are discussed, including nonlinear
hydrodynamical turbulence, convection and magnetic field role. In parallel to
the optically thick geometrically thin accretion disc models, a new branch of
the optically thin accretion disc models was discovered, with a larger
thickness for the same total luminosity. The choice between these solutions
should be done of the base of a stability analysis. The ideas underlying the
necessity to include advection into the accretion disc theory are presented and
first models with advection are reviewed. The present status of the solution
for a low-luminous optically thin accretion disc model with advection is
discussed and the limits for an advection dominated accretion flows (ADAF)
imposed by the presence of magnetic field are analysed.

degenerate stars must have evolved from main sequence progenitors more massive
than their B star companions, they can be used to place observational lower
limits on the maximum mass for white dwarf progenitors, and to investigate the
upper end of the initial-final mass relation. Assuming a pure hydrogen
composition, we constrain the temperature of the white dwarf companion to Theta
Hya to lie between 25,000K and 31,000K. We also predict that a third bright B
star, 16 Dra (B9.5V), might also be hiding an unresolved hot white dwarf

Title:On the Energetics of Advection-Dominated Accretion Flows,"
Abstract:  Using mean field MHD, we discuss the energetics of optically thin, two
temperature, advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). If the magnetic field
is tangled and roughly isotropic, flux freezing is insufficient to maintain the
field in equipartition with the gas. In this case, we expect a fraction of the
energy generated by shear in the flow to be used to build up the magnetic field
strength as the gas flows in; the remaining energy heats the particles. We
argue that strictly equipartition magnetic fields are incompatible with a
priori reasonable levels of particle heating; instead, the plasma $\beta$ in
ADAFs (defined to be the gas pressure divided by magnetic/turbulent pressure)
is likely to be $\gsim 5$; correspondingly, the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ is
likely to be $\lsim 0.2$

Abstract:  We numerically investigate the hydrodynamics of accretion disk reversal and
relate our findings to the observed spin-rate changes in the accreting X-ray
pulsar GX~1+4. In this system, which accretes from a slow wind, the accretion
disk contains two dynamically distinct regions. In the inner part viscous
forces are dominant and disk evolution occurs on a viscous timescale. In the
outer part dynamical mixing of material with opposite angular momentum is more
important, and the externally imposed angular momentum reversal timescale
governs the flow. In this outer region the disk is split into concentric rings
of material with opposite senses of rotation that do not mix completely but
instead remain distinct, with a clear gap between them. We thus predict that
torque reversals resulting from accretion disk reversals will be accompanied by
minima in accretion luminosity.

Title:Evolutionary Status of Dwarf ``Transition'' Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We present deep B, R and Halpha imaging of 3 dwarf galaxies: NGC3377A,
NGC4286, and IC3475. Based on previous broadband imaging and HI studies, these
mixed-morphology galaxies were proposed by Sandage & Hoffman (1991) to be,
respectively, a gas-rich low surface brightness Im dwarf, a nucleated dwarf
that has lost most of its gas and is in transition from Im to dS0,N, and the
prototypical example of a gas-poor ``huge low surface brightness'' early-type

global star formation rates are at least a factor of 20 below that of 30

unlikely that either galaxy will ever evolve into an IC3475 counterpart; and
(7) IC3475 is too blue to be a dE. We thus conclude that we have not identified
potential precursors to galaxies such as IC3475, and unless signifcant changes
occur in the star formation rates, neither NGC3377A nor NGC4286 will evolve
into a dwarf elliptical or dwarf spheroidal within a Hubble time.

Title:High Spatial Resolution Imaging of Arp 220 from 3 - 25 microns,"
Abstract:  Images of Arp 220 from 3.45 to 24.5 $\mu$m with 0.5'' resolution are
presented which clearly separate the nucleus into at least two components. The
western component is about three times more luminous than the eastern
component, but the silicate absorption in the fainter, eastern component is
roughly 50% greater than the absorption in the western component. Each
component is marginally resolved. The two components seen at 24.5 $\mu$m are
identified with the two radio components. The western source most likely
coincides with the high extinction disk previously suggested to exist in Arp
220, while the eastern nucleus is identified with a faint highly reddened
source seen in HST 2.2 $\mu$m NICMOS images. The two nuclei together account
for essentially all of the measured 24.5 $\mu$m flux density. Two models are
presented, both of which fit the observations. In one, the majority of the
total luminosity is produced in an extended star formation region and in the
other most of the luminosity is produced in the compact but extincted regions
associated with the two nuclei seen at 24.5 $\mu$m. In both pictures,
substantial luminosity at 100 $\mu$m emerges from a component having a diameter
of 2--3'' ($\sim$1kpc).

Title:X-ray Shots of Cyg X-1,"
Abstract:  X-ray shots of Cyg X-1 in different energy bands and spectral states have
been studied with PCA/RXTE observations. The detailed shot structure is
obtained by superposing many shots with one millisecond time bin through
aligning their peaks with an improved algorithm. In general, the shots are
composed of a slow rise and fast decay. The shot structures in the different
states are different. The duration of shot in the high state is shorter than
that in the low and transition states. The shot profile in the high energy band
is more asymmetric and narrower than that in the low energy band. The average
hardness of shot is lower than that of steady emission in the transition and
low states but higher than that in the high state. The time lags between the
shots in higher and lower energy bands have been found in the different states.
In transition states, the time lag is the largest among the different states of
Cyg X-1, and it is the smallest in the low state. The implications of the
observed shot features for shot models are discussed.

Title:Microwave Background Anisotropies and Nonlinear Structures I. Improved Theoretical Models,"
Abstract:  A new method is proposed for modelling spherically symmetric inhomogeneities
in the Universe. The inhomogeneities have finite size and are compensated, so
they do not exert any measurable gravitational force beyond their boundary. The
region exterior to the perturbation is represented by a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe, which we use to study the anisotropy
in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) induced by the cluster. All
calculations are performed in a single, global coordinate system, with
nonlinear gravitational effects fully incorporated. An advantage of the gauge
choices employed here is that the resultant equations are essentially Newtonian
in form. Examination of the problem of specifying initial data shows that the
new model presented here has many advantages over `Swiss cheese' and other
models. Numerical implementation of the equations derived here is described in
a subsequent paper.

Title:Light and Heavy Elements in the Galactic Bulge,"
Abstract:  The chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge is treated here in the context
of an inside-out model for the Galaxy formation. We assume that this central
region evolved even faster than the Galactic halo and test the effect of
changing the slope of the IMF on the predicted stellar metallicity distribution
for bulge stars. An IMF favoring the formation of massive stars is found to
improve the agreement with the most recently observed metallicity distribution
of bulge K giants. Then, we make specific predictions about temporal evolution
of several light and heavy species in the Galactic bulge. We predict that
alpha-elements should be enhanced relative to Fe for most of the [Fe/H] range,
with different degrees of enhancement due to the different nucleosynthetic
history of each element, and show that Lithium abundance should follow a trend
with metallicity similar to that found for the solar neighbourhood. Several
possible stellar Li sources are discussed.

Title:COMPTEL Observation of the Flaring Quasar PKS0528+134,"
Abstract:  With a direct demodulation method, we have reanalyzed the data from
COMPTEL/CGRO observation of PKS0528+134 during the 1993 March flare in
gamma-rays. Our results show that during the flare gamma-rays were detected at
a level approximately 2.4-3.8 times greater than the observed intensity in two
earlier COMPTEL observations VP 0 and VP 1 in the energy range 3 MeV to 30 MeV.
The 3-30 MeV time variability of the flux follows well the trend as observed by
EGRET/CGRO at higher energies. No convincing excess can be found around the
position of PKS0528+134 in the energy range 0.75 MeV to 3 MeV, which indicates
a spectral break around 3 MeV. The detections and non-detections in the four
standard COMPTEL energy bands are consistent with the earlier reports given by
Collmar et al., while the feature that gamma-rays of the quasar still kept on
flaring at energies down to 3 MeV is clearly found.

Abstract:  We consider the parametric excitation of a Langmuir wave and an

Manley-Rowe relations are fulfilled only in the limit of a cold plasma. As a

Title:The stellar populations of spiral disks.II Measuring and modeling the radial distribution of absorption spectral indices,"
Abstract:  The radial distributions of the Mg2 and Fe5270 Lick spectral indices have
been measured to large radial distances on the disks of NGC 4303 and NGC 4535
using an imaging technique based on interference filters. These data, added to
those of NGC 4321 previously published in Paper I of this series are used to
constraint chemical (multiphase) evolutionary models for these galaxies.
Because the integrated light of a stellar disk is a time average over the
history of the galaxy weighted by the star formation rate, these constraints
complement the information on chemical gradients provided by the study of HII
regions which, by themselves, can only provide the alpha-elements abundance
accumulate over the life of the galaxy. The agreement between the observations
and the model predictions shown here lends confidence to the models which are
then used to describe the time evolution of galaxy parameters such as star
formation rates, chemical gradients, and gradients in the mean age of the

Title:Helioseismic analysis of the hydrogen partition function in the solar interior,"
Abstract:  The difference in the adiabatic gradient gamma_1 between inverted solar data
and solar models is analyzed. To obtain deeper insight into the issues of
plasma physics, the so-called ``intrinsic'' difference in gamma_1 is extracted,
that is, the difference due to the change in the equation of state alone. Our
method uses reference models based on two equations of state currently used in
solar modeling, the Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen (MHD) equation of state, and the OPAL
equation of state (developed at Livermore). Solar oscillation frequencies from
the SOI/MDI instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft during its first 144 days
in operation are used. Our results confirm the existence of a subtle effect of
the excited states in hydrogen that was previously studied only theoretically
(Nayfonov & Dappen 1998). The effect stems from internal partition function of
hydrogen, as used in the MHD equation of state. Although it is a pure-hydrogen
effect, it takes place in somewhat deeper layers of the Sun, where more than
90% of hydrogen is ionized, and where the second ionization zone of helium is
located. Therefore, the effect will have to be taken into account in reliable
helioseismic determinations of the astrophysically relevant helium-abundance of
the solar convection zone.

Title:Constraining Variations in the Fine-Structure Constant with the Cosmic Microwave Background,"
Abstract:  Any time variation in the fine-structure constant alters the ionization
history of the universe and therefore changes the pattern of cosmic microwave
background fluctuations. We calculate the changes in the spectrum of these
fluctuations as a function of the change in the fine-structure constant, and we
find that these changes are dominated by the change in the redshift of
recombination due to the shift in the binding energy of hydrogen. We estimate
the accuracy with which the next generation of cosmic microwave background
experiments might constrain any variation in the fine-structure constant at z
of roughly 1000. We find that such experiments could potentially be sensitive
to $|\Delta \alpha/\alpha| \sim 10^{-2} - 10^{-3}$.

Title:The Metallicity Distribution in the Halo Stars of NGC 5128: Implications for Galaxy Formation,"
Abstract:  The Hubble Space Telescope has been used to obtain WFPC2 (V,I) photometry for
a sample of 10,000 red giant stars in the outer halo of the giant elliptical
NGC 5128. Comparison with the fiducial RGBs of Milky Way globular clusters and
model isochrones demonstrates that this outer-halo population is completely
dominated by old stars, with an extremely broad metallicity range extending
from the most metal-poor Galactic globulars at [Fe/H] = -2 up to Solar
abundance. By interpolation within the fiducial lines we derive the metallicity
distribution function (MDF) for the halo, which turns out to have a distinct
two-component structure: about 2/3 of the stars belong to a sharply peaked
metal-richer component ([Fe/H] = -0.3, sigma = 0.22 dex), while the remaining
one-third belong to a more extended metal-poor distribution sloping gradually
down to low metallicity. The MDF can be remarkably well matched by a simple
closed-box model of chemical enrichment, where the first component starts with
an initial abundance Z_0 =0 and the second component with Z_0 = 0.18 Z_Sun. A
basic ""in situ"" formation picture with two distinct epochs of star formation
fits the observations better than other models involving major contributions
from accretions or mergers.

Counts, colors for the star and galaxy samples are discussed and a comparison
with a deep HST image in the I band is presented. The percentage of merged or
blended galaxies in the SUSI data to this magnitude limit is estimated to be

Title:Spectral Models of Advection-Dominated Accretion Flows with Winds,"
Abstract:  We calculate spectral models of advection-dominated accretion flows, taking
into account the possibility that significant mass may be lost to a wind. We
apply the models to the soft X-ray transient V404 Cyg in quiescence and the
Galactic center source Sgr A*. We show that there are qualitative degeneracies
between the mass loss rate in the wind and parameters characterizing the
microphysics of the accretion flow; of particular importance is $\delta$, the
fraction of the turbulent energy which heats the electrons. For small $\delta$,
current observations of soft X-ray transients and Sgr A* suggest that at least
$\sim 10 %$ of the mass originating at large radii must reach the central
object. For large $\delta \sim 0.3$, however, models with significantly more
mass loss are in agreement with the observations. We also discuss constraints
on advection-dominated accretion flow models imposed by recent radio
observations of NGC 4649 and other nearby elliptical galaxies. We conclude by
highlighting future observations which may clarify the importance of mass loss
in sub-Eddington accretion flows.

separation of the two images is 0.35"" +/- 0.02"" and the intensity ratio
I_{north}/I_{south} = 1.21 +/- 0.25 in the H-band. No other image is detected
down to H(5sigma) = 21.3 within 10"" from the double image. Strong support for
the lensing hypothesis comes from the uniformity of the quasar spectrum as a
function of spatial position in the image obtained with the integral field
spectrograph OASIS at CFHT. From the 2D-spectroscopy, narrow-band images are
reconstructed over the wavelength range 5600-6200A to search for emission-line

Title:Cosmology with the Lyman-alpha Forest,"
Abstract:  We outline the physical picture of the high-redshift Ly-alpha forest that has
emerged from cosmological simulations, describe statistical characteristics of
the forest that can be used to test theories of structure formation, present a
preliminary comparison between simulation results and measurements from Keck
HIRES spectra, and discuss a recent determination of the slope and amplitude of
the linear mass power spectrum P(k) at z=2.5 from moderate resolution spectra.
The physical picture is simple if each QSO spectrum is viewed as a continuous
non-linear map of the line-of-sight density field rather than a collection of
discrete absorption lines. The distribution of flux decrements depends mainly
on the amplitude and PDF (Gaussian vs. non-Gaussian) of the primordial density
fluctuations. The threshold crossing frequency, analogous to the 3-d genus
curve, responds to the shape and amplitude of P(k) and to the values of Omega
and Lambda. Open and Lambda-CDM models agree well with the measured flux
decrement distribution at smoothing lengths of 25 km/s and 100 km/s and with
the threshold crossing frequency at 100 km/s. Discrepancy with the observed
threshold crossing frequency at 25 km/s may reflect the combined effects of
noise in the data and limited mass resolution of the simulations. The slope of
the measured P(k) agrees with the predictions of inflation+CDM models.
Combining the amplitude with COBE normalization imposes a constraint on these
models of the form Omega h^x n^y Omega_b^z = constant. Assuming Gaussian
primordial fluctuations and a power spectrum shape parameter Gamma~0.2,
consistency of the measured P(k) with the observed cluster mass function at z=0
requires Omega=0.46^{+0.12}_{-0.10} for an open universe and
Omega=0.34^{+0.13}_{-0.09} for a flat universe (1-sigma errors). (Shortened)

Title:Probing the Structure of Accreting Compact Sources Through X-Ray Time Lags and Spectra,"
Abstract:  We exhibit, by compiling all data sets we can acquire, that the Fourier
frequency dependent hard X-ray lags, first observed in the analysis of
aperiodic variability of the light curves of the black hole candidate Cygnus
X-1, appear to be a property shared by several other accreting black hole
candidate sources and also by the different spectral states of this source. We
then present both analytic and numerical models of these time lags resulting by
the process of Comptonization in a variety of hot electron configurations. We
argue that under the assumption that the observed spectra are due to
Comptonization, the dependence of the lags on the Fourier period provides a
means for mapping the spatial density profile of the hot electron plasma, while
the period at which the lags eventually level--off provides an estimate of the
size of the scattering cloud. We further examine the influence of the location
and spatial extent of the soft photon source on the form of the resulting lags
for a variety of configurations; we conclude that the study of the X-ray hard
lags can provide clues about these parameters of the Comptonization process
too. Fits of the existing data with our models indicate that the size of the
Comptonizing clouds are quite large in extent ($\sim$ 1 light second) with
inferred radial density profiles which are in many instances inconsistent with
those of the standard dynamical models, while the extent of the source of soft
photons appears to be much smaller than those of the hot electrons by roughly
two orders of magnitude and its location consistent with the center of the hot
electron corona.

Title:A New Channel for the Detection of Planetary Systems Through Microlensing: II. Repeating Events,"
Abstract:  In the companion paper we began the task of systematically studying the
detection of planets in wide orbits ($a > 1.5 R_E$) via microlensing surveys.
In this paper we continue, focusing on repeating events. We find that, if all
planetary systems are similar to our own Solar System, reasonable extensions of
the present observing strategies would allow us to detect 3-6 repeating events
per year along the direction to the Bulge. Indeed, if planetary systems with
multiple planets are common, then future monitoring programs which lead to the
discovery of thousands of stellar-lens events will likely discover events in
which several different planets within a single system serve as lenses, with
light curves exhibiting multiple repetitions. In this paper we discuss
observing strategies to maximize the discovery of all wide-orbit planet-lens
events. We also compare the likely detection rates of planets in wide orbits to
those of planets located in the zone for resonant lensing. We find that,
depending on the values of the planet masses and stellar radii of the lensed
sources (which determine whether or not finite source size is important), and
also on the sensitivity of the photometry used by observers, the detection of
planets in wide orbits may be the primary route to the discovery of planets via
microlensing. We also discuss how the combination of resonant and wide-orbit
events can help us to learn about the distribution of planetary system
properties (S 6.1). In addition, by determining the fraction of short-duration
events due to planets, we indirectly derive information about the fraction of
all short-duration events that may be due to low-mass MACHOs (S 6.2).

Title:Bias in the Cepheid PL relation,"
Abstract:  We show that the Cepheid PL relation is affected by a Malmquist type bias,
the so-called population incompleteness bias. Its calculated slope appears
shallower than the true one because of the cutoff in apparent magnitude
resulting from the instrumental limiting magnitude. Furthermore, the use of the
PL relation, even with the correct slope, leads to underestimation of distances
which is not negligible. We confirm this finding by studying simulated PL
relations, and we show that this bias may be as large as 0.2 or 0.3 magnitudes
on distance modulus. We also test the efficiency of a cutoff in $\log P$ and
show that it is a good way to minimize this bias. However, a correction of this

Title:Microwave background anisotropies and non-linear structures II. Numerical computations,"
Abstract:  A new method for modelling spherically symmetric inhomogeneities is applied
to the formation of clusters in an expanding Universe. We impose simple initial
velocity and density perturbations of finite extent and we investigate the
subsequent evolution of the density field. Photon paths are also calculated,
allowing a detailed consideration of gravitational lensing effects and
microwave background anisotropies induced by the cluster. We apply the method
to modelling high-redshift clusters and, in particular, we consider the
reported microwave decrement observed towards the quasar pair PC1643+4631 A&B.
We also consider the effect on the primordial microwave background power
spectrum due to gravitational lensing by a population of massive high-redshift
clusters.

Title:The 1998 outburst of the X-ray transient 4U 1630-47 observed with BeppoSAX,"
Abstract:  We report results of five pointed BeppoSAX observations of the black hole
candidate 4U 1630-47 during part of its 1998 outburst when the 2-10 keV source
luminosity decreased from 2.1x10^38 erg/s (for an assumed distance of 10 kpc)
by a factor of ~7. The 2-200 keV spectrum can be modeled by a soft
multi-temperature disk blackbody and a hard power-law. During four of the
observations, there is evidence for deviations from a pure power-law shape >~20
keV which may be due to reflection. As the outburst decayed a number of
spectral trends are evident: (1) the amount of photoelectric absorption
decreased, (2) the spectrum became harder (i.e. the power-law index became
smaller), (3) the temperature of the disk blackbody decreased and (4) the
inferred inner disk radius increased by a factor of ~4. The change in the
accretion disk inner radius during the outburst is in contrast to results from
other soft X-ray transients. We find that the disk blackbody temperature
depends on the inner disk radius roughly as T=r^(-3/4). For a standard
Shakura-Sunyaev disk model this implies that the inferred mass accretion rate
at the inner disk radius did not change appreciably during the part of the
outburst observed by BeppoSAX.

Title:The faint end of the Tully-Fisher relation,"
Abstract:  We have studied the relation between HI linewidth and optical luminosity in
two samples of dwarf galaxies, with special attention to the accuracy of the
inclination correction. The first sample consists of rotationally supported
galaxies, and has DDO 154 as a prototype. They have HI linewidths significantly
larger than predicted by an extrapolation of the Tully-Fisher relation. The
deviation from the extrapolated Tully-Fisher relation correlates with the
distance-independent mass-to-luminosity ratio M_HI/L_B. The baryonic correction
for these gas rich galaxies is too small to explain the deviation from the
Tully-Fisher relation, unless a small mass-to-light ratio (M/L_B)_* <= 0.25 for
the stellar population is assumed. The second sample contains dwarf galaxies
with comparable rotational and random velocities. This sample, having Leo A as
a prototype, is consistent with an extrapolation of the classical Tully-Fisher
relation to lower luminosities. These dwarf galaxies are not particularly rich
in gas, but their mass is dominated by baryonic matter within their HI radius.
We suggest that any evolution of the deviating galaxies towards the
Tully-Fisher relation will combine a decrease in linewidth by radial transport
of HI with an increase in luminosity due to a larger accumulated stellar mass.

Title:Bogus dust screens from well mixed exponential disks in galaxies,"
Abstract:  The V-K colours along the minor axes of spiral galaxies typically change from
red to blue with increasing distance, giving the impression that the near side
is systematically screened by dust. Such a preferred orientation for dust
screens is unlikely. Here we show that common extinction from the embedded dust
layer in an exponential disk has the same effect, making the near side
systematically redder as the inclination increases. The galaxy NGC 2841 is
modelled as an example, where the V-K profile is profoundly asymmetric and
actually step-like across the centre. We predict that the minor axis emission
profile of the same dust in the far-infrared, at wavelength 200 microns, will
be much more symmetric than the optical profiles, implying nearly equal column
densities of dust on both sides of the minor axis.

their conventional asymptotic magnitudes, provided that the point spread

large galaxy imaging surveys will measure. Bulge and disk parameters retrieved
from the growth curve will enable us to perform statistical studies of

Title:Hubble constant from sosie galaxies and HIPPARCOS geometrical calibration,"
Abstract:  New distances, larger than previous ones, have been obtained for M 31 and M
81 based on the geometrical zero-point of the Cepheid Period-luminosity
relation provided by the HIPPARCOS satellite. By combining them with
independent determinations we define reasonable ranges for the distances of
these important calibrating galaxies. On this basis, we determine the Hubble
constant from the method of sosies (look-alike) galaxies, galaxies having the
same characteristics than the calibrators. The method is quite secure because
it is purely differential and it does not depend on any assumption (apart from
the natural one that two sosies galaxies have similar absolute luminosities).
Nevertheless, the Malmquist bias has to be taken into account. The observations
behave exactly as predicted from the analytical formulation of the bias. Thus,
rejecting galaxies which are affected by the Malmquist bias we derive the
Hubble constant:
H_o = 60 +- 10 (external) km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}
If we strictly use the calibration obtained with HIPPARCOS and if the bias
found in the Period-Luminosity Relation is considered, the Hubble constant is
smaller than this ($\approx 55 km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}$). This gives arguments in
favour of the long-distance scale. We briefly discuss possible improvements
aiming at still reducing the uncertainty.

in this paper, show that for bright stars (V~<8) it is now possible to reach
K-band Strehl ratios in excess of 60% and to easily resolve binaries at the
diffraction limit of the telescope. In more typical usage Strehl ratios in the
range 10-15% can be achieved over a wide field (~2'); and the limiting
magnitude is currently V~<12.5. We also present some of the first spectroscopy
at diffraction limited scales, showing we are able to distinguish spectra of
binary stars with a separation of only 0.26''. Our last set of results are on
Abell galaxy clusters, including a correction on a galaxy using the laser guide
star as the reference. There are still a number of difficulties associated with
the laser, but our best result to date is of the galaxy UGC 1347 in Abell 262.

achieved in increase in peak intensity of 2.5, and a reduction in FWHM from

Title:Radio to Gamma-Ray Emission from Shell-type Supernova Remnants: Predictions from Non-linear Shock Acceleration Models,"
Abstract:  Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely believed to be the principal source of
galactic cosmic rays. Such energetic particles can produce gamma-rays and lower
energy photons via interactions with the ambient plasma. In this paper, we
present results from a Monte Carlo simulation of non-linear shock structure and
acceleration coupled with photon emission in shell-like SNRs. These
non-linearities are a by-product of the dynamical influence of the accelerated
cosmic rays on the shocked plasma and result in distributions of cosmic rays
which deviate from pure power-laws. Such deviations are crucial to acceleration
efficiency and spectral considerations, producing GeV/TeV intensity ratios that
are quite different from test particle predictions. The Sedov scaling solution
for SNR expansions is used to estimate important shock parameters for input
into the Monte Carlo simulation. We calculate ion and electron distributions
that spawn neutral pion decay, bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton, and synchrotron
emission, yielding complete photon spectra from radio frequencies to gamma-ray
energies. The cessation of acceleration caused by the spatial and temporal
limitations of the expanding SNR shell in moderately dense interstellar regions
can yield spectral cutoffs in the TeV energy range; these are consistent with
Whipple's TeV upper limits on unidentified EGRET sources. Supernova remnants in
lower density environments generate higher energy cosmic rays that produce
predominantly inverse Compton emission at super-TeV energies; such sources will
generally be gamma-ray dim at GeV energies.

Abstract:  The first detection of CO emission in a Fanaroff-Riley Class II (i.e.,
edge-brightened radio morphology) radio galaxy is presented. Multi- wavelength
(0.36-2.17 micron) imaging of 3C 293 shows it to be a disk galaxy with an
optical jet or tidal tail extending towards what appears to be a companion
galaxy 28 kpc away via a low surface brightness envelope. The molecular gas
appears to be distributed in an asymmetric disk rotating around an unresolved
continuum source, which is presumably emission from the AGN. A narrow (approx
60 km/s) absorption feature is also observed in the CO spectrum and is
coincident with the continuum source. Using the standard CO conversion factor,
the molecular gas mass is calculated to be 1.5x10^10 M_sun, several times the
molecular gas mass of the Milky Way. The high concentration of molecular gas
within the central 3 kpc of 3C 293, combined with the multiwavelength
morphological peculiarities, support the idea that the radio activity has been
triggered by a gas-rich galaxy-galaxy interaction or merger event.

Title:Highly-Magnetized Pulsars and Integral,"
Abstract:  The complete absence of radio pulsars with periods exceeding a few seconds
has lead to the popular notion of the existence of a high period death line. We
have recently postulated the existence of another radio quiescence boundary at
high magnetic fields ($B\gtrsim 4\times 10^{13}$G) in the upper portion of the
period-period derivative diagram, a domain where no radio pulsars are observed.
The origin of this high B boundary is also due to the suppression of magnetic
pair creation, $\gamma\to e^{\pm}$, but mainly because of competition with the
exotic QED process of magnetic photon splitting, $\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$,
coupled with ground state pair creation. This mechanism could also explain the
low spectral cutoff energy of the gamma-ray pulsar PSR1509-58, which lies near
the high B death-line. In this paper, we summarize the hypothesis of this new
``death line,'' and discuss some subtleties of pair suppression that relate to
photon polarization and positronium formation. We identify several ways in
which Integral will serve as a useful tool in probing high field pulsars, given
that the radio quiescence boundary is transparent to the high energy bands.

Title:Photometric Properties of Kiso Ultraviolet-Excess Galaxies in the Lynx-Ursa Major Region,"
Abstract:  We have performed a systematic study of several regions in the sky where the
number of galaxies exhibiting star formation (SF) activity is greater than
average. We used Kiso ultraviolet-excess galaxies (KUGs) as our SF-enhanced
sample. By statistically comparing the KUG and non-KUG distributions, we
discovered four KUG-rich regions with a size of $\sim 10^\circ \times
10^\circ$. One of these regions corresponds spatially to a filament of length
$\sim 60 h^{-1}$ Mpc in the Lynx-Ursa Major region ($\alpha \sim 9^{\rm h} -
10^{\rm h}, \delta \sim 42^\circ - 48^\circ$). We call this ``the Lynx-Ursa
Major (LUM) filament''. We obtained $V(RI)_{\rm C}$ surface photometry of 11 of
the KUGs in the LUM filament and used these to investigate the integrated
colors, distribution of SF regions, morphologies, and local environments. We
found that these KUGs consist of distorted spiral galaxies and compact galaxies
with blue colors. Their star formation occurs in the entire disk, and is not
confined to just the central regions. The colors of the SF regions imply that
active star formation in the spiral galaxies occurred $10^{7 - 8}$ yr ago,
while that of the compact objects occurred $10^{6-7}$ yr ago. Though the
photometric characteristics of these KUGs are similar to those of interacting
galaxies or mergers, most of these KUGs do not show direct evidence of merger
processes.

for the high-redshift powerful radio galaxies (HzPRGs: z > 1, P_408MHz > 10^27
Watts/Hz) are consistent with no evolution in molecular gas (H_2) mass with
redshift and/or radio power. Of the low-redshift powerful radio galaxies
(LzPRGs: z<0.2, P_408MHz MHz > 10^23.5 W/Hz) observed, only one F-R II galaxy
has been detected in CO, whereas approximately 50% of the radio-compact (FC)
and F-R I galaxies have been detected. The CO and imaging data to date imply
that either F-R II galaxies result from mergers of gas-poor galaxies relative
to FC/F-R I galaxies, or that some FC/F-R I galaxies evolve into F-R II
galaxies. In either scenario, the radio activity in powerful radio galaxies is
most likely triggered by a merger event, and H_2 may be the fuel for the active
galactic nucleus (AGN) in the early stages of the merger.

Title:A model for the postcollapse equilibrium of cosmological structure: truncated isothermal spheres from top-hat density perturbations,"
Abstract:  The postcollapse structure of objects which form by gravitational
condensation out of the expanding cosmological background universe is a key
element in the theory of galaxy formation. Towards this end, we have
reconsidered the outcome of the nonlinear growth of a uniform, spherical
density perturbation in an unperturbed background universe - the cosmological
``top-hat'' problem. We adopt the usual assumption that the collapse to
infinite density at a finite time predicted by the top-hat solution is
interrupted by a rapid virialization caused by the growth of small-scale
inhomogeneities in the initial perturbation. We replace the standard
description of the postcollapse object as a uniform sphere in virial
equilibrium by a more self-consistent one as a truncated, nonsingular,
isothermal sphere in virial and hydrostatic equilibrium, including for the
first time a proper treatment of the finite-pressure boundary condition on the
sphere. The results differ significantly from both the uniform sphere and the
singular isothermal sphere approximations for the postcollapse objects. These
results will have a significant effect on a wide range of applications of the
Press-Schechter and other semi-analytical models to cosmology. The truncated
isothermal sphere solution presented here predicts the virial temperature and
integrated mass distribution of the X-ray clusters formed in the CDM model as
found by detailed, 3D, numerical gas and N-body dynamical simulations
remarkably well. This solution allows us to derive analytically the
numerically-calibrated mass-temperature and radius-temperature scaling laws for
X-ray clusters which were derived empirically by Evrard, Metzler and Navarro
from simulation results for the CDM model. (Shortened)

Abstract:  Endeavours of the unification of the four fundamental interactions have
resulted in a development of theories having cosmological solutions in which
low-energy limits of fundamental physical constants vary with time. The
validity of such theoretical models should be checked by comparison of the
theoretical predictions with observational and experimental bounds on possible
time-dependences of the fundamental constants. Based on high-resolution
measurements of quasar spectra, we obtain the following direct limits on the
average rate of the cosmological time variation of the fine-structure constant
\alpha: |\dot{\alpha}/\alpha| < 1.9 \times 10^{-14} yr^{-1} is the most likely
limit, and |\dot{\alpha}/\alpha| < 3.1 \times 10^{-14} yr^{-1} is the most
conservative limit. Analogous estimates published previously, as well as other
contemporary tests for possible variations of \alpha (those based on the ""Oklo
phenomenon"", on the primordial nucleosynthesis models, and others) are
discussed and compared with the present upper limit. We argue that the present
result is the most conservative one.

Abstract:  Dark-matter halos show a universal density profile with a scaling such that

described by a proportionality between the characteristic density of halos and
the mean cosmic density at halo formation time. It has recently been shown that
this proportionality could be the result of the following simple evolutionary
picture. Halos form in major mergers with essentially the same,
cosmogony-dependent, dimensionless profile, and then grow inside-outside, as a
consequence of accretion. Here we verify the consistency of this picture and

Abstract:  In this paper we present results of an analysis of radio-quiet QSO
environments. The aim is to determine the relation between QSOs and galaxies as
a function of redshift. We cross-correlate a sample of ~150 QSOs from optically
and X-ray selected catalogues with faint, bj<23, galaxies. These data allow us
to probe the galaxy clustering environment of QSOs out to z~1.0-1.5. Far from
giving a positive correlation, at z<1.5 the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation
function is marginally negative, with w(theta<120'')=-0.027+-0.020. Colour
information suggests that the anti-correlation is most significant between the
QSOs and the red galaxy population.
We have constructed models to predict the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation, using
the known form of the galaxy N(z) at bj<23, and assuming a variety of
clustering evolution rates. Cases in which QSOs exist in rich cluster
environments are comfortably ruled out at more than 5sigma and the results are
more consistent with a `normal' galaxy environment for radio-quiet QSOs. If the
small anti-correlation is interpreted as an effect of gravitational lensing,
this conclusion is not altered. In this case, the data are only ~1sigma below
the low clustering amplitude models, while the high amplitude models are still
comfortably rejected. We therefore conclude that these QSOs may not be much
more highly biased than optically selected galaxies.

observed 3 square arcminutes and detected one emission line candidate object in
the field around PC 1109+4642. We discuss the possibilities that this object is
a star-forming galaxy at the QSO redshift, z_em=3.313 or a Seyfert galaxy. In
the former case, we infer a star formation rate of 170 Msun/yr for this
Kprime=21.3 object. The galaxy has a compact but resolved morphology, with a
FWHM=0.6arcs, or 4.2kpc at z=3.313 (H_0=50 km/s/Mpc and q_0=0.5). The comoving
density of such objects in QSO environments appears to be 0.0033Mpc^3,
marginally lower (<= 3sigma) than the density observed for Halpha-emitters in
absorption-line fields at z~2.5, but similar to the density of Lyman Break
Galaxies at z~3. If on the other hand, most of the line emission is [OIII] from
a Seyfert 2 nucleus at z=3.31, then the high inferred volume density could
imply a large evolution in the Seyfert 2 luminosity function from the current
epoch. We find the field containing the object to also contain many faint
extended objects in the Kprime image, but little significant excess over the
expected number-magnitude relation. We discuss the implication of the emission
line being a longer wavelength line at a lower redshift.

Title:The response of accretion disks to bending waves: angular momentum transport and resonances,"
Abstract:  We investigate the linear tidal perturbation of a viscous Keplerian disk by a
companion star orbiting in a plane inclined to the disk. We consider m=1
perturbations with odd symmetry with respect to the z=0 midplane. Since the
response of a viscous disk is not in phase with the perturbing potential, a
tidal torque is exerted on the disk, resulting in a decrease of its angular
momentum. This tidal torque is found to be comparable to the horizontal viscous
stress acting on the background flow when the perturbed velocities in the disk
are on the order of the sound speed. If these velocities remain subsonic, the
tidal torque can exceed the horizontal viscous stress only if the viscous
parameter \alpha which couples to the vertical shear is larger than that
coupled to the horizontal shear. In protostellar disks, bending waves are found
to propagate deep into the disk inner parts. If the waves are reflected at the
center, resonances occur when the frequency of the tidal waves is equal to that
of some free normal global bending mode of the disk. If such resonances exist,
tidal interactions may then be important even when the binary separation is
large. Out of resonance, the torque associated with the secular perturbation is
generally much larger than that associated with the finite frequency
perturbations. As long as the waves are damped before they reach the center,
the torque associated with the finite frequency perturbations does not depend
on the viscosity. These calculations are relevant to disks around young stars
and maybe also to disks in X-ray binary systems. (abridged)

Title:Real and Redshift-Space Clustering in the ESP Galaxy Redshift Survey,"
Abstract:  We discuss the two-point correlation properties of galaxies in the ESO Slice
Project (ESP) redshift survey, both in redshift and real space. The
redshift-space correlation function xi(s) for the whole magnitude-limited
survey is well described by a power law with \gamma ~ 1.55 between 3 and ~40/h
Mpc, where it smoothly breaks down, crossing the zero value on scales as large
as ~80/h Mpc. On smaller scales (0.2-2/h Mpc), the slope is shallower, mostly
due to redshift-space depression by virialized structures. This effect is found
to be enhanced by the J3 optimal-weighting estimator for xi. We explicitly
evidence these effects by computing xi(r_p,pi) and the projected function
w_p(r_p). In this way we recover the real-space correlation function xi(r),
which we fit below 10/h Mpc with a power-law model. This gives a reasonable
fit, with r_o=4.15^{+0.20}_{-0.21} /h Mpc and \gamma=1.67^{+0.07}_{-0.09}. This
results on xi(r) and xi(s), and the comparison with other surveys, clearly
confirm how the shape of spatial correlations above ~3/h Mpc is characterised
by a significant `shoulder' with respect to the small-scale ~ -1.8 power law,
corresponding to a steepening of P(k) near the turnover.

Abstract:  We present an X-ray spectral and spatial analysis of the composite

hard component may be either seen directly or can be explained by scattering of
the AGN powerlaw at circumnuclear warm high-column-density gas. A compilation
of the multi-wavelength properties of NGC 1365 and comparison with hard X-ray
selected AGNs shows that the hard component of NGC 1365 is too faint compared
to its broad Balmer line components challenging simple unified models.
According to analytical estimates, supernova driven outflow can fully account
for the X-ray luminosity in the Raymond-Smith component if the observed IR
emission is mainly provided by the central starburst. We do not find obvious
optical counterparts for three faint PSPC sources south of the nucleus. In
particular, there is no coincidence with the two supernovae reported in NGC
1365.
With the ROSAT HRI data, we have precisely located the extraordinary
southwest X-ray source NGC1365-X1 which falls on one of the subordinate spiral
arms. The source is found to be highly variable (a factor about 10) on the
timescale of months. Intrinsic to NGC 1365, its huge luminosity makes it
exceptional among stellar X-ray sources. At present, the most likely
interpretation seems to be an ultra-powerful X-ray binary.

Title:Review of Ground-Based CMB Experiments,"
Abstract:  We present in this paper a brief review of Ground-Based Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) experiments. We first recall the main experimental problems
and adopted solutions. We then review the Tenerife experiments, giving an
update together with some new results. Then results and problems from other
experiments are highlighted including IAC-Bartol, Python, Saskatoon, Mobile
Anisotropy Telecope (MAT) and the Owen Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO)

new interferometers such as the Very Small Array (VSA), the Cosmic Background
Imager (CBI) and the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI/VCA). To finish,
very recent work is presented on joint likelihood analysis for estimation of
cosmological parameters where both CMB results and Large Scale Structure (LSS)
surveys are considered.

Title:The contribution of brown dwarfs to the local mass budget of the Galaxy,"
Abstract:  Based on the recent discoveries of free floating brown dwarfs we derive
estimates of the local mass density of this population of objects. Mass density
estimates from various surveys span the range 0.03 to 0.005 M_Sun/pc^3. These
estimates are compared with the local mass densities of the other constituents
of the galactic disk and, in particular, with the dynamically determined total
local mass density. We argue that brown dwarfs might indeed contribute
significantly to the local mass budget, but that a local mass density as high
as 0.03 M_Sun/pc^3 as suggested by Ruiz et al. (1997) is rather unlikely.

Title:Using weak MgII lines to chart Low Surface Brightness Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We report the detection, based on HST and Keck data, of two peculiar
absorbers in the Ly-alpha forest of the quasar PKS 0454+039. These clouds, at
redshifts z=0.6248 and 0.9315 respectively, display both MgII and FeII
absorption lines in addition to the Ly-alpha line. Based upon photoionization
models, these are inferred to be photoionized by the intergalactic UV
background, and to have HI column densities in the range 15.8 < N(HI) < 16.8.
Furthermore, if one supposes that the relative abundances of heavy elements is
similar to that of depleted clouds of our galaxy, the abundances of these two
absorbers are greater than the solar value, which is a unique case for
absorbers which are not associated to the quasar. We tentatively suggest that
these absorbers may select giant low surface brightness galaxies.

Title:The Mpc-scale radio source associated with the GPS galaxy B1144+352,"
Abstract:  We present the results of new observations of the enigmatic radio source
B1144+352 with the WSRT at 1.4 GHz. The WENSS and NVSS surveys have revealed
faint extended radio structures on Mpc-scales. We have investigated these
large-scale radio components. One of the radio structures has a leading hotspot
and we conclude that this structure is a large radio lobe associated with the
GPS source. The other contains two separate radio sources which are superposed
on the sky: A low-power radio source at a similar redshift (z=0.065) to the GPS
host galaxy and an extended radio lobe, which we believe is associated with the
GPS host galaxy. Further, the 1.4-GHz flux density of the core has decreased by
70 mJy between 1994 and 1997. We have also retrieved and analysed unpublished
archival ROSAT HRI data of B1144+352. The source has been detected and appears
to be slightly extended in X-rays. The ROSAT data have not detected a large
extended X-ray halo surrounding the host galaxy, limiting the luminosity of the
intra-cluster gas within a radius of 250 kpc to < 2.3 x 10^42 erg/s. B1144+352
is the second GPS galaxy known to be associated with a Mpc-sized radio source,
the other being B1245+676. We argue that the observed structures must be the
result of an interrupted central jet-activity, and that as such these sources
may well be the progenitors of double-double radio galaxies.

Title:The Cosmic Distribution of Clustering,"
Abstract:  For a given statistic, A, the cosmic distribution function, Upsilon(VA), is
the probability of measuring a value VA in a finite galaxy catalog. For
statistics related to count-in-cells, such as factorial moments, F_k, the
average correlation function, xiav, and cumulants, S_N, the functions
Upsilon(VF_k), Upsilon(Vxiav), and Upsilon(VS_N) were measured in a large
tauCDM simulation. This N-body experiment simulates almost the full ``Hubble
Volume'' of the universe, thus, for the first time, it allowed for an accurate
analysis of the cosmic distribution function, and, in particular, of its
variance (Delta A)^2, the cosmic error. The resulting detailed knowledge about
the shape of Upsilon is crucial for likelihood analyses. The measured cosmic
error agrees remarkably well with the theoretical predictions of Szapudi &
Colombi (1996) and Szapudi, Bernardeau & Colombi (1998) in the weakly
non-linear regime, while the predictions are slightly above the measurements in
the highly nonlinear regime. When the relative cosmic error is small, (Delta
A/A)^2, function Upsilon is nearly Gaussian. When (Delta A/A)^2 approaches
unity or is larger, function Upsilon(VA) is increasingly skewed and well
approximated by a lognormal distribution for A=F_k, or A=xiav. The measured
cumulants follow accurately the perturbation theory predictions in the weakly
nonlinear regime. Extended perturbation theory is an excellent approximation
for all the available dynamic range.

Title:First estimate of the time delay in HE 1104-1805,"
Abstract:  We present first results from five years of spectrophotometric monitoring of
the bright double QSO and gravitational lens HE 1104-1805. The quasar has
varied considerably over this time, while the emission line fluxes appear to
have remained constant. We have constructed monochromatic continuum light
curves for components A and B, finding that B leads the variability. A
quantitative analysis with the Pelt method gives a best estimate for the light
travel time delay of about 0.73 years, although a value as low as 0.3 cannot
yet be excluded. We discuss possible models for the QSO-lens configuration and
use our measured time delay to predict the redshift of the lens, z_d. Finding
that most likely z_d < 1, we can rule out the hitherto favoured values of z_d =
1.32 or 1.66. A new candidate is an absorption system at z=0.73, but the lens
could also be an elliptical not detected in absorption.

Title:The dyadosphere of black holes and gamma-ray bursts,"
Abstract:  The ""dyadosphere"" has been defined (Ruffini, Preparata et al.) as the region
outside the horizon of a black hole endowed with an electromagnetic field
(abbreviated to EMBH for ""electromagnetic black hole"") where the
electromagnetic field exceeds the critical value, predicted by Heisenberg &
Euler for $e^+ e^-$ pair production. In a very short time ($\sim
O(\hbar/(mc^2))$), a very large number of pairs is created there. We here give
limits on the EMBH parameters leading to a Dyadosphere for $10M_{\odot}$ and
$10^5M_{\odot}$ EMBH's, and give as well the pair densities as functions of the
radial coordinate. We here assume that the pairs reach thermodynamic
equilibrium with a photon gas and estimate the average energy per pair as a
function of the EMBH mass. These data give the initial conditions for the
analysis of an enormous pair-electromagnetic-pulse or ""P.E.M. pulse"" which
naturally leads to relativistic expansion. Basic energy requirements for gamma
ray bursts (GRB), including GRB971214 recently observed at $z=3.4$, can be
accounted for by processes occurring in the dyadosphere. In this letter we do
not address the problem of forming either the EMBH or the dyadosphere: we
establish some inequalities which must be satisfied during their formation
process.

Abstract:  An automated search for metal-poor stars is carried out in the course of the

Galactic latitudes |b| \gtrsim 30 degrees. As the HES reaches approx. 1

Title:The implications of the large scale galaxy power spectrum for Cold Dark Matter,"
Abstract:  The APM Galaxy Survey maps the angular positions of more than one million
galaxies to $b_{J} = 20$, covering a volume comparable to the forthcoming Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. A numerical algorithm has been developed to estimate the
power spectrum in three dimensions, using the angular clustering and a model
for the redshift distribution of APM Galaxies. The power spectrum obtained is
free from distortions of the pattern of clustering caused by the peculiar
motions of galaxies. We discuss the uncertainties in the estimated power
spectrum and describe tests of the algorithm using large numerical simulations.
The APM Galaxy power spectrum shows an inflection at a wavenumber $k \sim 0.15
h/Mpc$, with evidence for a peak or turnover in the range $ k \sim 0.03-0.06
h/Mpc$. These features can place strong constraints on Cold Dark Matter models
for structure formation.

Title:Progressive Covering of the Accretion Disk Corona during Dipping in the LMXB XB 1916-053,"
Abstract:  Results are reported for analysis of the extensive Rosat observation of the
dipping low mass X-ray binary XB 1916-053. Dipping is 100% deep showing that
the emission regions are completely covered by the absorber. A good fit to the
non-dip spectrum is obtained using a model consisting of a blackbody with kT_BB
= 1.95 +0.74 -0.34 keV and a power law with photon index 2.32 +/- 0.04. These
components are identified with emission from the neutron star, and Comptonized
emission from an extended accretion disk corona (ADC). Dip spectra are
well-fitted by rapid absorption of the blackbody, and progressive covering of
the extended component, as the absorber moves across the source, with a
covering fraction that increases smoothly from zero to ~1.0. Progressive
covering shows that the Comptonized emission region is extended, consistent
with it originating in the accretion disk corona. The strong unabsorbed
component in the dip spectra is well-modelled as the uncovered part of the
Comptonized emission at all stages of dipping. There is no detectable change in
the low energy cut-off of the spectrum in dipping which supports the
identification of the unabsorbed part of the spectrum with the uncovered part
of the ADC emission. The absorbed part of the ADC emission is rapidly removed
from the 0.1 - 2.0 keV band of the PSPC, which therefore selects only the
uncovered part of the emission, and so the spectral evolution in dipping as
viewed by the PSPC depends only on the covering fraction, determined by the
geometric overlap between the source and absorber.

Title:A Population of Faint Non-Transient Low Mass Black Hole Binaries,"
Abstract:  We study the thermal and viscous stability of accretion flows in Low Mass
Black Hole Binaries (LMBHBs). We consider a model in which an inner
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) is surrounded by a geometrically thin
accretion disk, the transition between the two zones occurring at a radius
R_tr. In all the known LMBHBs, R_tr appears to be such that the outer disks
could suffer from a global thermal-viscous instability. This instability is
likely to cause the transient behavior of these systems. However, in most
cases, if R_tr were slightly larger than the estimated values, the systems
would be globally stable. This suggests that a population of faint persistent
LMBHBs with globally stable outer disks could be present in the Galaxy. Such
LMBHBs would be hard to detect because they would lack large amplitude
outbursts, and because their ADAF zones would have very low radiative
efficiencies, making the systems very dim. We present model spectra of such
systems covering the optical and X-ray bands.

taken with the Whipple Observatory 10m gamma-ray telescope. In the Mrk 421
campaign, conducted in 1995 April-May, correlations were observed between VHE
gamma-ray, X-ray, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and possibly R-band emission. The
X-rays and gamma rays vary together with similar flux amplitude while the EUV
photons lag the X-rays and gamma rays by ~1 day and have a lower variability
amplitude. In the Mrk 501 campaign, conducted in 1997 April, a correlation was
also observed between the VHE gamma rays and X-rays with no delays apparent.
Here, the VHE gamma-ray variability is larger than the X-rays. The observations
also indicate that the synchrotron spectrum extends to 100 keV before cutting
off. For Mrk 421, the X-ray/VHE gamma-ray correlation indicates that delta > 38
and B > 0.03G. For Mrk 501, the correlation indicates a more modest delta > 2

Title:Properties of Galaxy Clusters: Mass and Correlation Functions,"
Abstract:  We analyse parallel N-body simulations of three Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
universes to study the abundance and clustering of galaxy clusters. The
simulations cover a volume comparable to the forthcoming SDSS. We are able to
make robust measurements of cluster properties to a redshift larger than unity.
We extract halos using two independent, public domain group finders (FOF & HOP)
and find consistent results. The correlation function of clusters is in very
good agreement with a simple analytic prescription based upon a Lagrangian
biasing scheme developed by Mo & White (1996) and the Press-Schechter (PS)
formalism for the mass function. The R_0--D_c relation for the open CDM model
is in good agreement with the results from the APM Cluster Survey. The SCDM
universe shows a robust deviation in the shape and evolution of the mass
function when compared with that predicted by the PS formalism. Critical models
with a low sigma_8 normalization or small shape parameter Gamma show an excess
of massive clusters compared with the PS prediction. When cluster normalized,
the SCDM universe at z =1 contains 10 times more clusters with temperatures
greater than 7keV, compared with the PS prediction. The agreement between the
analytic and N-body mass functions of SCDM can be improved if the value of the
delta_c (the extrapolated linear theory threshold for collapse) is revised to
be $ delta_c(z) = 1.685[(0.7/sigma_8)(1+z)]^{-0.125}. Our best estimate for the
amplitude of fluctuations inferred from the local cluster abundance for SCDM is
sigma_{8} = 0.5 \pm 0.04. However, the discrepancy between the temperature
function predicted in a critical density universe and that observed at z=0.33
(Henry et al. 1998) remains. (abridged)

Title:Evolution of isolated halos and halos inside of groups and clusters in a LCDM model,"
Abstract:  A significant fraction of mass in the universe is believed to be in the form
of dark matter (DM). Due to gravitational instability, the DM collapses
hierarchically into DM halos. In this contribution we present a study of the
formation and evolution of such DM halos in a COBE-normalized spatially flat
LCDM model (Omega_0=1-Omega_L=0.3; h=0.7) using high-resolution N-body
simulations. The novelty of this study is use of the newly developed
halo-finding algorithms to study the evolution of both isolated and satellite
(located inside virial radii of larger group- and cluster-size systems) halos.
The force and mass resolution required for a simulated halo to survive in the
high-density environments typical of groups and clusters is high: ~1-3 kpc and
\~10^9 M_sun, respectively. We use the high-resolution Adaptive Refinement Tree
(ART) N-body code to follow the evolution of 256^3 dark matter particles with
dynamic range in spatial resolution of 32,000 in a box of 60/h Mpc.
We show that the correlation function of these halos is anti-biased with
respect to the dark matter correlation function and is high and steeper than
the correlation function of the isolated virialized objects. The correlation
function evolves only mildly between z=3 and z=1. The mass evolution of
isolated virialized objects determined from the simulation is in good agreement
with prediction of semi-analytical models. The differences exist, however, if
we include satellite halos in the halo catalogs.

Title:The Dynamical Evolution of Dense Rotating Systems: Paper I. Two-Body Relaxation Effects,"
Abstract:  This paper, and its companion, investigate the evolution of dense stellar
systems due to the influence of two-body gravitational encounters, physical
collisions and stellar evolution. Our goal is the simulation of the densest
centers of galaxies, like M32, which reach stellar densities near a million
solar masses per cubic parsec and which may harbor black holes. These systems
have a different Safronov number (the dimensionless ratio of stellar binding
energy to mean stellar kinetic energy) than globular clusters, substantially
increasing the importance of physical collisions relative to gravitational
encounters. In this paper, we focus only on the gravitational encounters. We
demonstrate, first, that our simulations with small N with a Hernquist tree
code yield results basically in accord with years of effort studying globular
clusters. Second, we investigate (crudely) core collapse in rotating systems
with mass segregation, to separate out the effects purely due to two-body
encounters from those seen in the more complex second paper.
Consistent with previous studies, we find that systems whose constituent
particles follow the Salpeter initial mass function rapidly undergo core
collapse through Spitzer's mass segregation instability. All rotationally
flattened systems show a decrease in flattening with time, consistent with
Fokker-Planck calculations. An interesting new result concerns the
well-established inability of simulators to identify a static center in their
simulations of collisional systems. We find that the lump of high mass stars
which condenses at the center wanders about the core in Brownian motion.

Title:The Dynamical Evolution of Dense Rotating Systems: Paper II. Mergers and Stellar Evolution,"
Abstract:  We report the results of simulations of dense rotating stellar systems whose
members suffer collisions and undergo stellar evolution processes. The initial
configuration for each experiment is an isotropic Kuzmin-Kutuzov model. The
dynamical evolution is simulated with the N-body tree code of Hernquist,
modified to incorporate physical stellar collisions, stellar evolution, stellar
mass loss and compact remnant formation, and star formation. In some
simulations we have added a large accreting central black hole. In all systems
the velocity dispersion in the halo evolves toward a radially biased state. In
systems containing a central black hole, the dispersion becomes tangentially
biased in the core, whereas it remains isotropic in systems with no black hole.
Collisions tend to produce a single dominant stellar merger product, as opposed
to a swarm of intermediate-mass stars. In cases where we have suppressed all
processes except relaxation and physical collisions, objects with greater
flattening produce larger stars through mergers. In systems where stellar
ejecta are allowed to escape the system, mass loss from the heavy core stars
temporarily reduces the core density and collision rate.
Most of the simulations performed reproduced the ratio of the central
collision time scale to the central relaxation time scale found in the dwarf
elliptical galaxy M32. The rapid central evolution of these systems due to
collisions and relaxation, combined with scaling the results in N, suggests
that we are either viewing M32 at a peculiar moment in its history, or that its
dynamically-inferred central density is at least in part due to the present of
a massive dark object, presumably a black hole.

Title:Biased-estimations of the Variance and Skewness,"
Abstract:  Nonlinear combinations of direct observables are often used to estimate
quantities of theoretical interest. Without sufficient caution, this could lead
to biased estimations. An example of great interest is the skewness $S_3$ of
the galaxy distribution, defined as the ratio of the third moment $\xibar_3$
and the variance squared $\xibar_2^2$. Suppose one is given unbiased estimators
for $\xibar_3$ and $\xibar_2^2$ respectively, taking a ratio of the two does
not necessarily result in an unbiased estimator of $S_3$. Exactly such an
estimation-bias affects most existing measurements of $S_3$. Furthermore,
common estimators for $\xibar_3$ and $\xibar_2$ suffer also from this kind of
estimation-bias themselves: for $\xibar_2$, it is equivalent to what is
commonly known as the integral constraint. We present a unifying treatment
allowing all these estimation-biases to be calculated analytically. They are in
general negative, and decrease in significance as the survey volume increases,
for a given smoothing scale. We present a re-analysis of some existing
measurements of the variance and skewness and show that most of the well-known
systematic discrepancies between surveys with similar selection criteria, but
different sizes, can be attributed to the volume-dependent estimation-biases.
This affects the inference of the galaxy-bias(es) from these surveys. Our
methodology can be adapted to measurements of analogous quantities in quasar
spectra and weak-lensing maps. We suggest methods to reduce the above
estimation-biases, and point out other examples in LSS studies which might
suffer from the same type of a nonlinear-estimation-bias.

Title:Megamaser Disks in Active Galactic Nuclei,"
Abstract:  Recent spectroscopic and VLBI-imaging observations of bright extragalactic
water maser sources have revealed that the megamaser emission often originates
in thin circumnuclear disks near the centers of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
Using general radiative and kinematic considerations and taking account of the
observed flux variability, we argue that the maser emission regions are clumpy,
a conclusion that is independent of the detailed mechanism (X-ray heating,
shocks, etc.) driving the collisionally pumped masers. We examine scenarios in
which the clumps represent discrete gas condensations (i.e., clouds) and do not
merely correspond to velocity irregularities in the disk. We show that even two
clouds that overlap within the velocity coherence length along the line of
sight could account (through self-amplification) for the entire maser flux of a
high-velocity ``satellite'' feature in sources like NGC 4258 and NGC 1068, and
we suggest that cloud self-amplification likely contributes also to the flux of
the background-amplifying ``systemic'' features in these objects. Analogous
interpretations have previously been proposed for water maser sources in
Galactic star-forming regions. We argue that this picture provides a natural
explanation of the time-variability characteristics of extragalactic megamaser
sources and of their apparent association with Seyfert 2-like galaxies. We also
show that the requisite cloud space densities and internal densities are
consistent with the typical values of nuclear (broad emission-line region-type)
clouds.

Title:The Nature and Evolution of Classical Double Radio Sources from Complete Samples,"
Abstract:  We present a study of the trends in luminosity, linear size, spectral index,
and redshift of classical double radio sources from three complete samples
selected at successively fainter low radio-frequency flux-limits. We have been
able to decouple the effects of the tight correlation between redshift and
luminosity (inherent in any single flux-limited sample) which have hitherto
hindered interpretation of the relationships between these four source
properties. The major trends found are that (i) spectral indices increase with
linear size, (ii) rest-frame spectral indices have a stronger dependence on
luminosity than on redshift except at high (GHz) frequencies, and that (iii)
the linear sizes are smaller at higher redshifts. We reproduce the observed
dependences in a model for radio sources (born throughout cosmic time according
to a radio-source birth function) whose lobes are fed with a
synchrotron-emitting population (whose energy distribution is governed by
compact hotspots), and which suffer inverse Compton, synchrotron and adiabatic
expansion losses. In simulating the basic observed dependences, we find that
there is no need to invoke any systematic change in the environments of these
objects with redshift if the consequences of imposing a survey flux-limit on
our simulated datasets are properly included in the model. We present evidence
that for a radio survey there is an unavoidable `youth--redshift degeneracy',
even though radio sources are short-lived relative to the age of the Universe;
it is imperative to take this into account in studies which seemingly reveal
correlations of source properties with redshift such as the `alignment effect'.

Abstract:  We present new observations of the cluster-lens Abell 370: a deep HST/WFPC2
F675W image and ESO 3.6m spectroscopy of faint galaxies. These observations
shade new lights on the statistical properties of faint lensed galaxies. In
particular, we spectroscopically confirm the multiple image nature of the
B2--B3 gravitational pair (Kneib et al. 1993), and determine a redshift of
z=0.806 which is in very good agreement with earlier predictions. A refined
mass model of the cluster core (that includes cluster galaxy halos) is
presented, based on a number of newly identified multiple images. Following
Bezecourt et al. (1998a), we combine the new cluster mass model with a
spectrophotometric prescription for galaxy evolution to predict the arclets
number counts and redshift distribution in the HST image. In particular, the
ellipticity distribution of background sources is taken into account, in order
to properly estimate the statistical number and redshift distribution of
arclets. We show that the redshift distribution of arclets, and particularly
its high redshift tail can be used as a strong constraint to disentangle
different galaxy evolution scenario. A hierarchical model which includes a
number density evolution is favored by our analysis. Finally, we compute the
depletion curves in the faint galaxies number counts and discuss its wavelength
dependence.

Title:Wavelet analysis and the detection of non-Gaussianity in the CMB,"
Abstract:  We investigate the use of wavelet transforms in detecting and characterising
non-Gaussian structure in maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We
apply the method to simulated maps of the Kaiser-Stebbins effect due to cosmic
strings onto which Gaussian signals of varying amplitudes are superposed. We
find the method significantly outperforms standard techniques based on
measuring the moments of the pixel temperature distribution. We also compare
the results with those obtained using techniques based on Minkowski
functionals, and we again find the wavelet method to be superior. In
particular, using the wavelet technique, we find that it is possible to detect
non-Gaussianity even in the presence of a superposed Gaussian signal with five
times the rms amplitude of the original cosmic string map. We also find that
the wavelet technique is useful in characterising the angular scales at which
the non-Gaussian signal occurs.

Title:The Growth of Dark-Matter Halos. The Effects of Accretion and Mergers,"
Abstract:  High resolution cosmological N-body simulations show that the density
profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchical cosmogonies are universal, with
low mass halos typically denser than more massive ones. This mass-density
correlation is interpreted as reflecting the earlier formation of less massive
objects. We investigate this hypothesis in the light of formation times defined
as the epoch at which halos experience their last major merger. We find that
the characteristic density and the scale radius of halos are essentially
proportional, respectively, to the critical density of the universe and the
virial radius at the time of their formation. These two relations are
consistent with the following simple evolutionary picture. Violent relaxation
caused by major mergers rearrange the structure of halos leading to a universal
dimensionless density profile. Between major mergers, halos gradually grow
through the accretion of surrounding layers by keeping the central part steady
and only expanding their virial radius as the critical density of the universe
diminishes.

"Title:The Meinunger ""Nicht Rote"" Objects","
Abstract:  Four high-latitude slow variable stars have been noted by Meinunger (1972) as
""nicht rote"" (""not red"") objects and thus curious. We have previously reported
(Margon & Deutsch 1997) that one of these objects, CC Boo, is in fact a QSO.
Here we present observations demonstrating that the remaining three are also
highly variable active galactic nuclei. The most interesting object of the four

at z=0.063. Despite the rapid and large reported variability amplitude (~1.6
mag), the spectrum is that of a perfectly normal galaxy, with no emission lines
or evident nonthermal continuum. We also present new spectroscopic and
photometric observations for AR CVn, suggested by Meinunger to be an RR Lyrae
star despite its very faint magnitude (<B>=19.4). The object is indeed one of
the most distant RR Lyrae stars known, at a galactocentric distance of ~40 kpc.

Title:Cosmic structure formation in Hybrid Inflation models,"
Abstract:  A wide class of inflationary models, known as Hybrid Inflation models, may
produce topological defects during a phase transition at the end of the
inflationary epoch. We point out that, if the energy scale of these defects is
close to that of Grand Unification, then their effect on cosmic structure
formation and the generation of microwave background anisotropies cannot be
ignored. Therefore, it is possible for structure to be seeded by a combination
of the adiabatic perturbations produced during inflation and active
isocurvature perturbations produced by defects. Since the two mechanisms are
uncorrelated the power spectra can be computed by a weighted average of the
individual contributions. We investigate the possible observational
consequences of this with reference to general Hybrid Inflation models and also
a specific model based on Supergravity. These mixed perturbation scenarios have
some novel observational consequences and these are discussed qualitatively.

Title:Cold + Hot Dark Matter After Super-Kamiokande,"
Abstract:  The recent atmospheric neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande provide strong
evidence of neutrino oscillations and therefore of non-zero neutrino mass.
These data imply a lower limit on the hot dark matter (i.e., light neutrino)
contribution to the cosmological density $\Omega_\nu >~ 0.001$ --- almost as
much as that of all the stars in the universe --- and permit higher
$\Omega_\nu$. The ``standard'' COBE-normalized critical-matter-density (i.e.,
$\Omega_m=1$) Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model has too much power on small scales.
But adding to CDM neutrinos with mass of about 5 eV, corresponding to
$\Omega_\nu \approx 0.2$, results in a much improved fit to data on the nearby
galaxy and cluster distribution. Indeed, the resulting Cold + Hot Dark Matter
(CHDM) cosmological model is arguably the most successful $\Omega_m=1$ model
for structure formation. However, other recent data has begun to make the case
for $\Omega_m <~ 0.6$ fairly convincing. In light of all this new data, we
reconsider whether cosmology still provides evidence favoring neutrino mass of
a few eV in flat models with cosmological constant $\Omega_\Lambda = 1 -
\Omega_m$. We find that the possible improvement of the low-$\Omega_m$ flat
(LCDM) cosmological models with the addition of light neutrinos appears to be
rather limited.

Title:Data compression on board the PLANCK Satellite Low Frequency Instrument: optimal compression rate,"
Abstract:  Data on board the future PLANCK Low Frequency Instrument (LFI), to measure
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, consist of $N$ differential
temperature measurements, expanding a range of values we shall call $R$.
Preliminary studies and telemetry allocation indicate the need of compressing
these data by a ratio of $c_r \simgt 10$. Here we present a study of entropy
for (correlated multi-Gaussian discrete) noise, showing how the optimal
compression $c_{r,opt}$, for a linearly discretized data set with
$N_{bits}=\log_2{N_{max}}$ bits is given by: $c_r \simeq
{N_{bits}/\log_2(\sqrt{2\pi e} ~\sigma_e/\Delta)}$, where $\sigma_e\equiv (det
C)^{1/2N}$ is some effective noise rms given by the covariance matrix $C$ and
$\Delta \equiv R / N_{max}$ is the digital resolution. This $\Delta$ only needs
to be as small as the instrumental white noise RMS: $\Delta \simeq \sigma_T
\simeq 2 mK$ (the nominal $\mu K$ pixel sensitivity will only be achieved after
averaging). Within the currently proposed $N_{bits}=16$ representation, a
linear analogue to digital converter (ADC) will allow the digital storage of a
large dynamic range of differential temperature $R= N_{max} \Delta $ accounting
for possible instrument drifts and instabilities (which could be reduced by
proper on-board calibration). A well calibrated signal will be dominated by
thermal (white) noise in the instrument: $\sigma_e \simeq \sigma_T$, which
could yield large compression rates $c_{r,opt} \simeq 8$. This is the maximum
lossless compression possible. In practice, point sources and $1/f$ noise will
produce $\sigma_e > \sigma_T$ and $c_{r,opt} < 8$. This strategy seems safer
than non-linear ADC or data reduction schemes (which could also be used at some
stage).

Title:TeV Burst of Gamma-Ray Bursts and Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays,"
Abstract:  Some recent experiments detecting very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays above
10-20 TeV independently reported VHE bursts for some of bright gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs). If these signals are truly from GRBs, these GRBs must emit a much
larger amount of energy as VHE gamma-rays than in the ordinary photon energy
range of GRBs (keV-MeV). We show that such extreme phenomena can be reasonably
explained by synchrotron radiation of protons accelerated to \sim 10^{20-21}
eV, which has been predicted by Totani (1998a). Protons seem to carry about
(m_p/m_e) times larger energy than electrons, and hence the total energy
liberated by one GRB becomes as large as \sim 10^{56} (\Delta \Omega / 4 \pi)
ergs. Therefore a strong beaming of GRB emission is highly likely. Extension of
the VHE spectrum beyond 20 TeV gives a nearly model-independent lower limit of
the Lorentz factor of GRBs, as $\gamma \gtilde 500$. Furthermore, our model
gives the correct energy range and time variability of ordinary keV-MeV
gamma-rays of GRBs by synchrotron radiation of electrons. Therefore the VHE
bursts of GRBs strongly support the hypothesis that ultra high energy cosmic
rays observed on the Earth are produced by GRBs.

"Title:Gamma-Ray Bursts, Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, and Cosmic Gamma-Ray Background","
Abstract:  We argue that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may be the origin of the cosmic
gamma-ray background radiation observed in GeV range. It has theoretically been
discussed that protons may carry a much larger amount of energy than electrons
in GRBs, and this large energy can be radiated in TeV range by synchrotron
radiation of ultra-high-energy protons (\sim 10^{20} eV). The possible
detection of GRBs above 10 TeV suggested by the Tibet and HEGRA groups also
supports this idea. If this is the case, most of TeV gamma-rays from GRBs are
absorbed in intergalactic fields and eventually form GeV gamma-ray background,
whose flux is in good agreement with the recent observation.

Title:Gas Dynamics and Large-Scale Morphology of the Milky Way Galaxy,"
Abstract:  We present a new model for the gas dynamics in the galactic disk inside the
Sun's orbit. Quasi-equilibrium flow solutions are determined in the
gravitational potential of the deprojected COBE NIR bar and disk, complemented
by a central cusp and, in some models, an outer halo. These models generically
lead to four-armed spiral structure between corotation of the bar and the solar
circle; their large-scale morphology is not sensitive to the precise value of
the bar's pattern speed, to the orientation of the bar with respect to the
observer, and to whether or not the spiral arms carry mass.
Our best model provides a coherent interpretation of many observed gas
dynamical features. Its four-armed spiral structure outside corotation
reproduces quantitatively the directions to the five main spiral arm tangents
at |l|<=60deg observed in a variety of tracers. The 3-kpc-arm is identified
with one of the model arms emanating from the ends of the bar, extending into
the corotation region. The model features an inner gas disk with a cusped orbit
shock transition to an x_2 orbit disk of radius R~150pc.
The bar's corotation radius is fairly well--constrained at R_c=3.5 +/- 0.5
kpc. The best value for the orientation angle of the bar is probably 20-25deg,
but the uncertainty is large since no detailed quantitative fit to all features
in the observed lv-diagrams is yet possible. The Galactic terminal velocity
curve from HI and CO observations out to l=+/-45deg (=5 kpc) is approximately
described by a maximal disk model with constant mass-to-light ratio for the NIR
bulge and disk.

Title:Power density spectrum of NGC 5548 and the nature of its variability,"
Abstract:  We derive power density spectra in the optical and X-ray band in the
timescale range from several years down to $\sim $ a day. We suggest that the
optical power density spectrum consists of two separate components: long
timescale variations and short timescale variations, with the dividing
timescale around 100 days. The shape of the short timescale component is
similar to X-ray power density spectrum which is consistent with the
interpretation of short timescale optical variations being caused by X-ray
reprocessing. We show that the observed optical long timescale variability is
consistent with thermal pulsations of the accretion disc.

Abstract:  In this paper we present a data analysis regarding globular clusters as
possible extragalactic distance indicators. For this purpose, we collected all
velocity dispersion measurements published for galactic and M31 globular
clusters. The slope and the zero-point of the Faber-Jackson relation were
calibrated using Hipparcos distance measurements, and the relation was applied
to extragalactic globular clusters in M31. A distance modulus of 24.12 \pm 0.45
mag was found. This is coherent with what is found by fitting the red giant
branches of globular clusters (24.47 \pm 0.07, Holland 98), and is found from
the peak of globular clusters luminosity function (24.03 \pm 0.23, Ostriker an
d Gnedin 97), but shorter than the 24.7 \pm 0.2 mag (Lanoix et al. 98) and
24.77 \pm 0.11 mag (Feast and Catchpole 97), obtained by using Hipparcos data
to calibrate the Cepheid period-luminosity. This calibrated Faber-Jackson
relation can now be directly use for other Sc galaxies with resolved globular
clusters, as soon as large amounts of spectra will become available, e.g.,

Title:Discovery of Correlated Behavior Between the HXR and the Radio Bands in Cygnus X-3,"
Abstract:  Using CGRO/BATSE hard X-ray (HXR) data and GHz radio monitoring data from the
Green Bank Interferometer (GBI), we have performed a long term study ($\sim$
1800 days) of the unusual X-ray binary Cyg X-3 resulting in the discovery of a
remarkable relationship between these two wavelength bands. We find that,
during quiescent radio states, the radio flux is strongly anticorrelated with
the intensity of the HXR emission. The relationship switches to a correlation
with the onset of major radio flaring activity. During major radio flaring
activity the HXR drops to a very low intensity during quenching in the radio
and recovers during the radio flare. Injection of plasma into the radio jets of
Cyg X-3 occurs during changes in the HXR emission and suggests that
disk-related and jet-related components are responsible for the high energy
emission.

Abstract:  The X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of galaxies is dominated by AGN
(classified by their optical spectra) above
Lx=10**42 erg/s, below this value by normal galaxies. The X-ray flux of AGN
at low X-ray luminosity therefore contains contributions from stellar processes
(winds, supernova explosions etc.). Until now it is not clear which fraction of
the observed X-ray flux has to be associated to the underlying stellar
emission. We started to investigate a complete luminosity-limited sample of AGN
and galaxies with log Lx < 42.5 to discriminate between the nuclear and galaxy
flux. Using the ROSAT HRI data we calculated the radial wobble-corrected
profiles of the sources which were compared to a new HRI point spread function
(PSF) template derived from 21 X-ray bright stars. The majority of the
low-luminosiy AGN shows evidence for a significant fraction of extended X-ray
emission.

Title:The Formation and Fragmentation of Primordial Molecular Clouds,"
Abstract:  Many questions in physical cosmology regarding the thermal history of the
intergalactic medium, chemical enrichment, reionization, etc. are thought to be
intimately related to the nature and evolution of pregalactic structure. In
particular the efficiency of primordial star formation and the primordial IMF
are of special interest. We present results from high resolution
three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations that follow the collapse
of primordial molecular clouds and their subsequent fragmentation within a
cosmologically representative volume. Comoving scales from 128 kpc down to 0.5
pc are followed accurately. Dark matter dynamics, hydrodynamics and all
relevant chemical and radiative processes (cooling) are followed
self-consistently for a cluster normalized CDM structure formation model.
Primordial molecular clouds with ~100,000 solar masses are assembled by mergers
of multiple objects that have formed hydrogen molecules in the gas phase with a
fractional abundance of <~ 10^-4. As the subclumps merge cooling decreases the
temperature to ~200 Kelvin in multiple ""cold pockets"" of the merger product.
Within these cold pockets, quasi-hydrostatically contracting cores with masses
\~ 100 M_sun and number densities > 100,000/cm^3 are found. We find that less
than 1% of the primordial gas in such small scale structures cools and
collapses to sufficiently high densities to be available for primordial star
formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that the formation of very massive
objects, massive black holes, fragmentation of a large fraction of baryons into
brown dwars or Jupiter size fragments seems, in contrast to various claims in
the literature, very unlikely. The expected escape fraction of UV photons with
(h nu) > 11eV is very small.

Title:Measurements of Far-UV Emission from Elliptical Galaxies at z=0.375,"
Abstract:  The ``UV upturn'' is a sharp rise in spectra of elliptical galaxies shortward
of rest-frame 2500 A. It is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nearby giant elliptical
galaxies, and is thought to arise primarily from low-mass evolved stars on the
extreme horizontal branch and beyond. Models suggest that the UV upturn is a
very strong function of age for these old stellar populations, increasing as
the galaxy gets older. In some models the change in UV/optical flux ratio is a
factor of 25 over timescales of less than 3 Gyr. To test the predictions for
rapid evolution of the UV upturn, we have observed a sample of normal
elliptical galaxies in the z=0.375 cluster Abell 370 with the Faint Object
Camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. A combination of two long-pass
filters was used to isolate wavelengths shortward of rest-frame 2700 A,
providing a measurement of the UV upturn at a lookback time of approximately 4
Gyr. Surprisingly, the four elliptical galaxies observed show a range of UV
upturn strength that is similar to that seen in nearby elliptical galaxies,
with an equivalent 1550-V color ranging from 2.9-3.4 mag. Our result is
inconsistent with some models for the UV upturn; other models are consistent
only for a high redshift of formation (z_f >= 4).

Keck spectra in addition to Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and International
Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra. We use an improved redshift and a lower \HI
column density to model the absorption. The HST spectrum shows an asymmetric
Lyman-$\alpha$ (\lya) feature which is produced by either \HI at a second
velocity, or a high abundance of D. Three models with a single simple H+D
component give $8 \times 10^{-5} < D/H < 57 \times 10^{-5}$ (95%), a much
larger range than reported by Webb et al (1997a,b). A more sophisticated
velocity distribution, or a second component is necessary for lower D/H. With
two components, which could be a part of one absorbing structure, or separate
clouds in a galaxy halo, we find $D/H < 50 \times 10^{-5}$. We do not know if
this second component is present, but it is reasonable because 40 -- 100% of
absorption systems with similar redshifts and \HI column densities have more

Title:Redshift estimate of a gravitational lens from the observed reddening of a multiply imaged quasar,"
Abstract:  Light rays from a multiply imaged quasar usually sample different path
lengths across the deflector. Extinction in the lensing galaxy may thus lead to
a differential obscuration and reddening between the observed macro-lensed QSO
images. These effects naturally depend on the precise shape of the extinction
law and on the redshift of the lens. By means of numerical Monte-Carlo
simulations, using a least-squares fitting method and assuming an extinction
law similar to that observed in the Galaxy, we show how accurate photometric
observations of multiply imaged quasars obtained in several spectral bands
could lead to the estimate of the lens redshift, irrespective of the visibility
of the deflector. Observational requirements necessary to apply this method to
real cases are thoroughly discussed. If extinction laws turn out to be too
different from galaxy to galaxy, we find out that more promising observations
should consist in getting high signal-to-noise low resolution spectra of at
least three distinct images of a lensed quasar, over a spectral range as wide
as possible, from which it should be straightforward to extract the precise
shape of the redshifted extinction law. Very high signal-to-noise, low spectral
resolution, VLT observations of H1413+117 and MG 0414+0534 should enable one to
derive such a redshifted extinction law.

which appear bluer than expected, confirming previous observations (Forbes et

morphological types show disks become the dominant population at faint
magnitudes. The median redshift of the sample is z~0.2, from a photometric

Title:On Source Density Evolution of Gamma-ray Bursts,"
Abstract:  Recent optical afterglow observations of gamma-ray bursts indicate a setting
and distance scale that many relate to star-formation regions. In this paper,
we use $<V/V_{max}>$ and a set of artificial trigger thresholds to probe
several potential GRB source density evolutionary scenarios. In particular, we
compare a uniform subset of BATSE 4B data to cosmological scenarios where GRBs
evolve as the comoving density, the star formation rate, the QSO rate, and the
SN Type Ic rate. Standard candle bursts with power-law spectra and a universe
without vacuum energy were assumed. Our results significantly favor a comoving
density model, implying that GRB source density evolution is weaker than
expected in these evolutionary scenarios. GRB density might still follow
star-formation rates given proper concurrent GRB luminosity evolution,
significant beaming, significant error in standard candle assumptions, or were
a significant modification of star formation rate estimates to occur.

Abstract:  Most models for blazars and gamma-ray bursts involve relativistic plasma
outflows powered by accretion processes onto black holes. The blast wave
physics developed for cosmological models of GRBs is reviewed. Two points
relevant for blazar modeling are made: (1) The injection of nonthermal
relativistic particles in the comoving frame is simply treated though a process
of energizing the plasma as it sweeps up material from the surrounding medium.
(2) The primary energy source of blazar radiation derives from the bulk kinetic
energy of the outflowing plasma. Thus deceleration of the plasma blast wave
must be included in blazar flaring calculations, and this process will
introduce temporal and spectral effects in addition to those produced by
acceleration and radiative cooling.

Title:Was GRB~980329 at z ~ 5?,"
Abstract:  The optical transient (OT) associated with GRB~980329 was remarkably red. It
has previously been concluded that this was the result of dust extinction in
the host galaxy. However, an extinction model can only agree with the data if
the $I$ band observations taken about 0.8 days after outburst are discounted;
the flux density ratio between the $I$ and the $R$ of a factor $\sim 7$ is too
great to be explained by extinction, given the relatively blue $K-I$ color.
Here it is shown that the {\it entire} observed optical/infrared spectrum is
consistent with that which is expected from an unextincted OT at $z \sim 5$. At
this redshift, the light in the observer's $R$ band is strongly suppressed by
absorption in the Ly$\alpha$ forest -- an effect which has been clearly seen in
galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. In spite of its potentially high redshift,
GRB~980329 was an unusually bright burst. If GRB 980329 was indeed at $z \sim
5$, and its gamma-rays were radiated isotropically, the implied energy of the
burst would be $ 5 \times 10^{54}$~ergs. Should GRB~980329 have a host galaxy,

Title:Photofluid Instabilities of Hot Stellar Envelopes,"
Abstract:  Beginning from a relatively simple set of dynamical equations for a fluid
permeated by a radiative field strong enough to produce significant forces, we
find the structure of plane-parallel equilibria and study their stability to
small acoustic disturbances. In doing this, we neglect viscous effects and
complications of nongreyness. We find that acoutic instabilities occur over a
wide range of conditions below the Eddington limit. This result is in line with
findings reported twenty years ago but it contradicts some more recent reports
of the absence of instabilities. We briefly attempt to identify the causes of
the discrepancies and then close with a discussion of the possible
astrophysical interest of such instabilities.

"Title:The jet/disk symbiosis III. What the radio cores in GRS 1915+105, NGC 4258, M81, and Sgr A tell us about accreting black holes","
Abstract:  We have derived simplified equations for a freely expanding, pressure driven
jet model as a function of jet power and applied it successfully to the radio
cores in the black hole candidates GRS 1915+105, NGC 4258, and M81 which are
observationally well defined systems, and to Sgr A*. By using equipartition
assumptions, the model has virtually no free parameters and can explain all
sources by just scaling the jet power. In GRS 1915+105 it also naturally
explains the jet velocity and the radio time delay. The jet powers we derive
for the radio cores of the first three sources are comparable to their
accretion disk luminosities, providing further evidence for the existence of
symbiotic jet/disk systems and a common engine mechanism also in low-luminosity
AGN and stellar mass black holes. With the exception of Sgr A* an advection
dominated accretion flow (ADAF) does not seem to be necessary to explain any of
the radio cores which span a large range in luminosity and size, as well as in
black hole masses and accretion rate---from Eddington to extreme sub-Eddington.
We suggest, however, that the jet model can be used to derive minimum accretion
rates and thus find that Sgr A* seems to be truly radiatively deficient---even
in a starved black hole model---and that a combination of jet and ADAF model
may be one possible solution.

Title:The Ionizing Continuum of Quasars,"
Abstract:  The ionizing continuum shape of quasars is generally not directly observable,
but indirect arguments, based on photoionization models and thin accretion disk
models suggest that it should peak in the extreme UV, and drop steeply into the
soft X-ray regime. However, recent observations of very soft X-ray emission in
low z quasars, and far UV emission of high z quasars, suggest that the ionizing
continuum of quasars does not peak in the extreme UV, and may extend as a
single power law from ~1000 A to ~1 keV. If true, that has interesting
implications for photoionization models and for accretion disk models. The
proposed revised continuum shape will be tested directly in the near future
with FUSE.

"Title:Physical Origin, Evolution and Observational Signature of Diffused Antiworld","
Abstract:  The existence of macroscopic regions with antibaryon excess in the baryon
asymmetric Universe with general baryon excess is the possible consequence of
practically all models of baryosynthesis. Diffusion of matter and antimatter to
the border of antimatter domains defines the minimal scale of the antimatter
domains surviving to the present time. A model of diffused antiworld is
considered, in which the density within the surviving antimatter domains is too
low to form gravitationally bound objects. The possibility to test this model
by measurements of cosmic gamma ray fluxes is discussed. The expected gamma ray
flux is found to be acceptable for modern cosmic gamma ray detectors and for
those planned for the near future.

Abstract:  We report the possible detection of a Li I 6708 AA line enhancement during an
unusual long-duration optical flare in the recently discovered, X-ray/EUV
selected, chromospherically active binary 2RE J0743+224. The Li I equivalent
width (EW) variations follow the temporal evolution of the flare and large
changes are observed in the intensity of the line. The maximum Li I enhancement
occurs just after the maximum chromospheric emission observed in the flare. A
significant increase of the 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio is also detected. No
significant simultaneous variations are detected in other photospheric lines.
Neither line blends nor starspots seem to be the primary cause of the observed
Li I line variation. From all this we suggest that this Li I enhancement is
produced by spallation reactions during the flare.

Title:Properties of Galactic Outflows: Measurements of the Feedback from Star Formation,"
Abstract:  Properties of starburst-driven outflows in dwarf galaxies are compared to
those in more massive galaxies. Over a factor of roughly 10 in galactic
rotation speed, supershells are shown to lift warm ionized gas out of the disk
at rates up to several times the star formation rate. The amount of mass
escaping the galactic potential, in contrast to the disk, does depend on the
galactic mass. The temperature of the hottest extended \x emission shows little
variation around $\sim 10^{6.7}$ K, and this gas has enough energy to escape
from the galaxies with rotation speed less than approximately 130 km/s.

Abstract:  We present the results of a long ROSAT HRI observation of the candidate
intermediate polar TW Pic. The power spectrum shows no sign of either the
previously proposed white dwarf spin period or the proposed binary orbital
period (1.996 hr and 6.06 hr respectively). The limits to the X-ray modulation
are less than 0.3% in each case. In the absence of a coherent X-ray pulsation,
the credentials of TW Pic for membership of the intermediate polar subclass
must be suspect. We further suggest that the true orbital period of the binary
may be the shorter of the two previously suggested, and that the longer period
may represent a quasi-periodic phenomenon associated with the accretion disc.

Abstract:  Simulated observations of a $10\dg \times 10\dg$ field by the Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (MAP) are analysed in order to separate cosmic microwave
background (CMB) emission from foreground contaminants and instrumental noise
and thereby determine how accurately the CMB emission can be recovered. The
simulations include emission from the CMB, the kinetic and thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects from galaxy clusters, as well as Galactic dust,
free-free and synchrotron. We find that, even in the presence of these
contaminating foregrounds, the CMB map is reconstructed with an rms accuracy of
about 20 $\mu$K per 12.6 arcmin pixel, which represents a substantial
improvement as compared to the individual temperature sensitivities of the raw
data channels. We also find, for the single $10\dg \times 10\dg$ field, that
the CMB power spectrum is accurately recovered for $\ell \la 600$.

Title:A semi-analytical model of disk evaporation by thermal conduction,"
Abstract:  The conditions for disk evaporation by electron thermal conduction are
examined, using a simplified semi--analytical 1-D model. The model is based on
the mechanism proposed by Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister (1994) in which an advection
dominated accretion flow evaporates the top layers from the underlying disk by
thermal conduction. The evaporation rate is calculated as a function of the
density of the advective flow, and an analysis is made of the time scales and
length scales of the dynamics of the advective flow. It is shown that
evaporation can only completely destroy the disk if the conductive length scale
is of the order of the radius. This implies that radial conduction is an
essential factor in the evaporation process. The heat required for evaporation
is in fact produced at small radii and transported radially towards the
evaporation region.

Title:Time-Integrated Gamma-Ray Burst Synchrotron Spectra from Blast Wave/Cloud Interactions,"
Abstract:  We show that the spectral shape of the low energy tails found for the
time-integrated spectra of gamma-ray bursts, even in the absence of strong
synchrotron cooling, can be significantly softer than the $\nu F_\nu \propto
\nu^{4/3}$ asymptote predicted by synchrotron shock models. As we have noted in
a previous work, blast wave deceleration via interaction with ambient material
causes the characteristic electron injection energy to decrease in proportion
to the bulk Lorentz factor of the blast wave, and under certain conditions,
this effect will at least partially account for the observed increase in pulse
widths with decreasing energy. This spectral softening can also be reflected in
the time-integrated pulse spectrum. Using a simple model for the blast wave
interaction with a dense cloud of material, we show that just below the $\nu
F_\nu$ spectral peak the integrated spectrum behaves as $\nu F_\nu \sim
\nu^{1/2}$ and rolls over to a $\nu^{4/3}$ dependence at lower energies, thus a
spectral shape arises which is similar to that predicted for the spectrum of a
strongly synchrotron-cooled electron population. We discuss the implications of
this work in the context of models of burst light curve variability which are
based on blast wave/cloud interactions.

Abstract:  The maximum entropy method has been used to reconstruct images in a wide

astronomical reconstruction problems. In particular, we derive the form of the
entropy for positive/negative distributions and use direct counting arguments
to find the form of the entropic prior. We also derive the measure on the space
of positive/negative distributions, which allows the definition of probability
integrals and hence the proper quantification of errors.

addition to point sources, the simulations include emission from the CMB and
the kinetic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects from galaxy clusters,
as well as Galactic dust, free-free and synchrotron emission. We find that the
main input components are faithfully recovered and, in particular, that the
quality of the CMB reconstruction is only slightly reduced by the presence of
point sources. In addition, we find that it is possible to recover accurate
point source catalogues at each of the Planck Surveyor observing frequencies.

full-resolution VSOP image (900:1), and an image made with only the space
baselines (200:1). The space baselines alone are sufficient for a reliable
recovery of the source structure, within the limits of the achieved spatial
sampling of the visibility data. The curved jet ridge line observed in the
images can be described by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities developing in a
relativistic outflow with the Mach number of about 6. This description holds on
the scales of up to 700h^-1 pc, and is shown to be consistent with variable
apparent speeds observed in the jet.

Title:The Eastern Arm of M83 Revisited: High-Resolution Mapping of 12CO 1-0 Emission,"
Abstract:  We have used the Owens Valley Millimeter Array to map 12CO (J=1-0) along a
3.5 kpc segment of M83's eastern spiral arm at resolutions of 6.5""x3.5"", 10"",
and 16"". The CO emission in most of this segment lies along the sharp dust lane
demarking the inner edge of the spiral arm, but beyond a certain point along
the arm the emission shifts downstream from the dust lane to become better
aligned with the young stars seen in blue and H-beta images. This morphology
resembles that of the western arm of M100. Three possibilities, none of which
is wholly satisfactory, are considered to explain the deviation of the CO arm
from the dust lane: heating of the CO by UV radiation from young stars, heating
by low-energy cosmic rays, and a molecular medium consisting of two (diffuse
and dense) components which react differently to the density wave. Regardless,
the question of what CO emission traces along this spiral arm is a complicated
one. Strong tangential streaming is observed where the arm crosses the
kinematic major axis of the galaxy, implying that the shear becomes locally
prograde in the arms. Inferred from the streaming is a very high gas surface
density of about 230 solar masses/pc**2 and an arm-interarm contrast greater
than 2.3 in the part of the arm near the major axis. Using two different
criteria, we find that the gas at this location is well above the threshold for
gravitational instability -- much more clearly so than in either M51 or M100.

density of N_HI=1.2E20 cm^-2, a maximum absorption optical depth of tau=0.10
and a maximum 21-cm emission brightness temperature of 1.4 K, this line of
sight yields a spin temperature, T_s, between 20 K and 40 K. H I 21-cm
absorption and emission spectroscopy toward 7 other low column density
sightlines on the periphery of the LMC and SMC reveal absorption toward one
additional background radio source behind the SMC with tau=0.03. The data have
typical sensitivities of sigma_tau=0.005 to 0.070 in absorption and
sigma_{T_B}=0.03 K in emission. These data demonstrate the presence of a cold
atomic phase which is probably accompanied by molecular condensations in the
tenuous interstellar medium of the Bridge region. Young OB stars observed in
the Magellanic Bridge could form ""in situ"" from these cold condensations rather
than migrate from regions of active star formation in the main body of the SMC.
The existence of cold condensations and star formation in the Magellanic Bridge
might be understood as a small scale version of the mechanism that produces
star formation in the tidal tails of interacting galaxies.

Title:Large-Scale Mass Power Spectrum from Peculiar Velocities,"
Abstract:  The power spectrum of mass density fluctuations is estimated from the Mark
III and the SFI catalogs of peculiar velocities by applying a maximum
likelihood analysis, using parametric models for the power spectrum and for the
errors. Generalized CDM models with and without COBE normalization are used.
The applications to the two different data sets give consistent results. The
general result is a relatively high amplitude of the power spectrum, eg, at
k=0.1 h/Mpc we find P(k) \Omega^{1.2} = (4.5+/-2.0)X10^3 (Mpc/h)^3,
corresponding to \sigma_8 \Omega^{0.6} = 0.85+/-0.2. Model-dependent
constraints on combinations of cosmological parameters are obtained for
families of COBE-normalized CDM models. These can roughly be approximated by
\Omega h_{60}^\mu n^\nu = 0.6+/-0.2, where \mu=1.3 and \nu=3.7, 2.0 for flat
\Lambda CDM models with and without tensor fluctuations respectively. For open
CDM, without tensor fluctuations, the powers are \mu=0.9 and \nu=1.4. The
quoted error-bars reflect the 90% formal likelihood uncertainty for each model
and the variance among different models and between catalogs. This is a brief
review of a collaborative project (for more details, see Zaroubi et al 1997,

Title:Optical Versus Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Classification of Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies,"
Abstract:  The origin of huge infrared luminosities of ultraluminous infrared galaxies
(ULIGs) is still in question. Recently, Genzel et al. made mid-infrared (MIR)
spectroscopy of a large number of ULIGs and found that the major energy source
in them is massive stars formed in the recent starburst activity; i.e., $\sim$
70% -- 80% of the sample are predominantly powered by the starburst. However,
it is known that previous optical spectroscopic observations showed that the
majority of ULIGs are classified as Seyferts or LINERs (low-ionization nuclear
emission-line regions). In order to reconcile this difference, we compare types
of emission-line activity for a sample of ULIGs which have been observed in
both optical and MIR. We confirm the results of previous studies that the
majority of ULIGs classified as LINERs based on the optical emission-line
diagnostics turn to be starburst-dominated galaxies based on the MIR ones.
Since the MIR spectroscopy can probe more heavily-reddened, inner parts of the
ULIGs, it is quite unlikely that the inner parts are powered by the starburst
while the outer parts are powered by non-stellar ionization sources. The most
probable resolution of this dilemma is that the optical emission-line nebulae
with the LINER properties are powered predominantly by shock heating driven by
the superwind activity; i.e., a blast wave driven by a collective effect of a
large number of supernovae in the central region of galaxy mergers.

an inwards spiraling starburst in all three near-IR bands. NGC 2992 shows
evidence for emission along a radio loop. Compared with HST optical images,
dust obscuration becomes significantly less pronounced at longer wavelengths,
revealing the true geometry of the core regions. The observed structures may
help to elucidate fueling mechanisms for the central engine, as well as
providing insight into the unification paradigms. The results are tempered with

Title:Cosmological Evolution of the Submillimetre Luminosity of High-Redshift Radio Galaxies,"
Abstract:  A systematic survey measuring the submillimetre continuum luminosity in radio
galaxies between redshifts z ~ 0.1 - 5 is currently in progress. The first
results from observations with the bolometer array SCUBA on the JCMT suggest a
trend of increasing submillimetre luminosity with redshift out to z ~ 4.
Assuming the continuum emission at 850um is dominated by thermal radiation from
dust heated by young, massive stars, the straightforward interpretation of
these data implies that the host galaxies of powerful radio sources, presumably
ellipticals or their progenitors, exhibit increased star formation activity
with increasing redshift. However a severe bias may distort the true picture
since only a subset of 30 galaxies have been observed, which represent the most
luminous radio sources (P_(151 MHz) > 10^27.5 W Hz^-1 sr^-1), whilst the
complete sample covers ~4 decades in radio power (10^25 - 10^29 W Hz^-1 sr^-1).
This on-going observational programme continues to improve coverage of the
radio power-redshift plane in an attempt to remove this potential bias towards
higher AGN activity and hence understand more fully the relationship between
high-z AGN, their level of starformation, and the evolutionary status of their
host galaxies.

of the two data sets we have derived a sample of about 1600 REX. Among the 393
REX identified so far a high fraction is represented by AGNs, typically radio
loud QSOs and BL Lacs. The remaining sources are galaxies, typically radio
galaxies isolated or in cluster. Thanks to the low flux limits in the radio and
in the X-ray band and the large area of sky covered by the survey, we intend to
derive a new complete and unbiased sample of BL Lacs which will contain both
``RBL'' and ``XBL'' type objects. In this way, the apparent dichotomy resulting
from the current samples of BL Lacs will be directly analyzed in a unique
sample. Moreover, the high number of BL Lacs expected in the REX sample (about
200) will allow an accurate estimate of their statistical properties. To date,
we have discovered 15 new BL Lacs and 11 BL Lac candidates with optical
properties intermediate between those of a typical elliptical galaxy and those
of a typical BL Lac object. These objects could harbour weak sources of
non-thermal continuum in their nuclei and, if confirmed, they could represent
the faint tail of the BL Lac population. The existence of such ``weak'' BL Lacs
is matter of discussion in recent literature and could lead to a re-assessment
of the defining criteria of a BL Lac and, consequently, to a revision of their

Italian/Dutch satellite BeppoSAX has led to a detection of high red-shift
absorption lines in the optical afterglow of GRB970508 and in several other
bursts and to the identification of host galaxies to others. This has confirmed
the cosmological origin. Cosmological GRBs release $\sim 10^{51}-10^{53}$ergs
in a few seconds making them the most (electromagnetically) luminous objects in
the Universe. The simplest, most conventional, and practically inevitable,
interpretation of these observations is that GRBs result from the conversion of
the kinetic energy of ultra-relativistic particles or possibly the
electromagnetic energy of a Poynting flux to radiation in an optically thin
region. This generic ""fireball"" model has also been confirmed by the afterglow
observations. The ""inner engine"" that accelerates the relativistic flow is
hidden from direct observations. Consequently it is difficult to infer its
structure directly from current observations. Recent studies show, however,
that this ``inner engine'' is responsible for the complicated temporal
structure observed in GRBs. This temporal structure and energy considerations
indicates that the ``inner engine'' is associated with the formation of a
compact object - most likely a black hole.

Title:Reconstructing Projected Matter Density from Cosmic Microwave Background,"
Abstract:  Gravitational lensing distorts the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies and imprints a characteristic pattern onto it. The distortions
depend on the projected matter density between today and redshift $z \sim
1100$. In this paper we develop a method for a direct reconstruction of the
projected matter density from the CMB anisotropies. This reconstruction is
obtained by averaging over quadratic combinations of the derivatives of CMB
field. We test the method using simulations and show that it can successfully
recover projected density profile of a cluster of galaxies if there are
measurable anisotropies on scales smaller than the characteristic cluster size.
In the absence of sufficient small scale power the reconstructed maps have low
signal to noise on individual structures, but can give a positive detection of
the power spectrum or when cross correlated with other maps of large scale
structure. We develop an analytic method to reconstruct the power spectrum
including the effects of noise and beam smoothing. Tests with Monte Carlo
simulations show that we can recover the input power spectrum both on large and
small scales, provided that we use maps with sufficiently low noise and high
angular resolution.

Title:Hydrodynamical Simulations of Gamma Ray-Bursts from Internal Shocks in Relativistic Fireballs,"
Abstract:  We simulate the dynamics of the interaction between relativistically
expanding spherically symmetric shells using a 1-dimensional hydrodynamic code
and calculate spectra and light-curves arising from such collisions by
integrating the synchrotron and inverse Compton emission of the shocked gas.
The numerical results reflect the most important features observed in Gamma-Ray
Bursts: the spectrum exhibits a progressive softening (its break energy
decaying exponentially with the 50--300 keV photon fluence), and the pulses
that form the burst appear narrower in higher energy bands. Analytical results
for the most important physical parameters of the burst are obtained by solving
the shock jump conditions for a pair of interacting shells, in the case when
both the forward and reverse shocks are relativistic.

Title:Wide-Field CCD Photometry of the Globular Cluster M30,"
Abstract:  We present new VI photometry for the halo globular cluster M30 (NGC 7099),
and compute luminosity functions (LFs) in both bands for samples of about
15,000 hydrogen-burning stars from near the tip of the red giant branch (RGB)
to over four magnitudes below the main-sequence (MS) turnoff. We confirm
previously observed features of the LF that are at odds with canonical
theoretical predictions: an excess of stars on subgiant branch (SGB)
approximately 0.4 mag above the turnoff and an excess number of RGB stars
relative to MS stars. Based on subdwarfs with Hipparcos-measured parallaxes, we
compute apparent distance moduli of (m-M)_{V} = 14.87+/-0.12 and 14.65+/-0.12
for reddenings of E(V-I)=0.06 and 0.02 respectively. The implied luminosity for
the horizontal branch (HB) at these distances is M_V(HB)=0.11 and 0.37 mag. The
two helium indicators we have been able to measure (R and Delta) both indicate
that M30's helium content is high relative to other clusters of similar
metallicity. M30 has a larger value for the parameter Delta V_{TO}^{HB} than
any of the other similarly metal-poor clusters for which this quantity can be
reliably measured. This suggests that M30 has either a larger age or higher
helium content than all of the other metal-poor clusters examined. The
color-difference method for measuring relative ages indicates that M30 is
coeval with the metal-poor clusters M68 and M92.

Title:What Controls the Star Formation in Luminous Starburst Mergers ?,"
Abstract:  In order to understand what controls the star formation process in luminous
starburst mergers (e.g., NGC 6240, Arp 220, and so on), we investigate
observational properties of two samples of high-luminosity starburst galaxies
mapped in CO($J$=1--0) independently using both the Owens Valley Radio
Observatory (Scoville et al. 1991) and the IRAM interferometer (Downes &
Solomon 1998). We find that the surface density of far-infrared luminosity,
$\Sigma$(FIR), is proportional linearly to the H$_2$ surface mass density,
$\Sigma$(H$_2$), for the two samples; $\Sigma$(FIR) $\propto
\Sigma$(H$_2$)$^{1.01\pm0.06}$ with a correlation coefficient of 0.96. It is
often considered that $\Sigma$(FIR) provides a good measure of the star
formation rate per unit area, $\Sigma$(SFR). It is also known that molecular
gas is dominated in circumnuclear regions in the luminous starburst mergers;
i.e., $\Sigma$(gas) $\simeq \Sigma$(H$_2$). Therefore, the above relationship
suggests a star formation law; $\Sigma$(SFR) $\propto \Sigma$(gas). We suggest
that this star formation law favors the gravitational instability scenario
rather than the cloud-cloud collision one.

Title:Infrared interferometry of circumstellar envelopes,"
Abstract:  This paper will review the technical progress of interferometric infrared
observing techniques from the first 2-element interferometer 25 years ago to
the 3+ element arrays now coming into service. To date, only the Infrared
Spatial Interferometer (ISI) has published separate-element interferometric
data on circumstellar dust shells in the infrared and many of these scientific
results will be discussed. Speckle interferometry has also evolved
significantly over the last few decades as slit-scanning techniques over
single-pixel detectors have largely been replaced by fast-readout of large
format detector arrays. Important near-infrared and mid-infrared results
derived from speckle data will also be reviewed.
Until recently, two-dimensional information about circumstellar dust
distributions has been sorely lacking, hence detections of dust shell
asymmetries have been difficult and uncertain. New speckle observations using
modern, 10-m class telescopes have yielded surprising results, demonstrating
the importance of accurate closure phase information in interpreting
interferometric data. These discoveries hopefully precursor those to be made
from closure-phase imaging with the new generation of separate-element,
interferometric arrays.

Title:The Palomar Testbed Interferometer,"
Abstract:  The Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) is a long-baseline infrared
interferometer located at Palomar Observatory, California. It was built as a
testbed for interferometric techniques applicable to the Keck Interferometer.
First fringes were obtained in July 1995. PTI implements a dual-star
architecture, tracking two stars simultaneously for phase referencing and
narrow-angle astrometry. The three fixed 40-cm apertures can be combined
pair-wise to provide baselines to 110 m. The interferometer actively tracks the
white-light fringe using an array detector at 2.2 um and active delay lines
with a range of +/- 38 m. Laser metrology of the delay lines allows for servo
control, and laser metrology of the complete optical path enables narrow-angle
astrometric measurements. The instrument is highly automated, using a
multiprocessing computer system for instrument control and sequencing.

Title:Rapid variability in the synchrotron self Compton model for blazars,"
Abstract:  Blazars are characterized by large amplitude and fast variability, indicating
that the electron distribution is rapidly changing, often on time scales
shorter than the light crossing time. The emitting region is sufficiently
compact to let radiative losses dominate the cooling of high energy electrons.
We study the time dependent behaviour of the electron distribution after
episodic electron injection phases, and calculate the observed synchrotron and
self Compton radiation spectra. Since photons produced in different part of the
source have different travel times, the observed spectrum is produced by the
electron distribution at different stages of evolution. Even a homogeneous
source then resembles an inhomogeneous one. Time delays between the light
curves of fluxes at different frequencies are possible, as illustrated for the
specific case of the BL Lac object Mkn 421.

Title:Stellar Kinematics of the Double Nucleus of M31,"
Abstract:  We report observations of the double nucleus of M31 with the f/48 long-slit
spectrograph of the HST Faint Object Camera. We obtain a total exposure of
19,000 sec. over 7 orbits, with the 0.063-arcsec-wide slit along the line
between the two brightness peaks (PA 42). A spectrum of Jupiter is used as a
spectral template. The rotation curve is resolved, and reaches a maximum
amplitude of ~250 km/s roughly 0.3 arcsec either side of a rotation center
lying between P1 and P2, 0.16 +/- 0.05 arcsec from the optically fainter P2. We
find the velocity dispersion to be < 250 km/s everywhere except for a narrow
``dispersion spike'', centered 0.06 +/- 0.03 arcsec on the anti-P1 side of P2,
in which sigma peaks at 440 +/- 70 km/s. At much lower confidence, we see local
disturbances to the rotation curve at P1 and P2, and an elevation in sigma at
P1. At very low significance we detect a weak asymmetry in the line-of-sight
velocity distribution opposite to the sense usually encountered. Convolving our
V and sigma profiles to CFHT resolution, we find good agreement with the
results of Kormendy & Bender (1998, preprint), though there is a 20%
discrepancy in the dispersion that cannot be attributed to the dispersion
spike. Our results are not consistent with the location of the maximum
dispersion as found by Bacon et al. We find that the sinking star cluster model
of Emsellem & Combes (1997) does not reproduce either the rotation curve or the
dispersion profile. The eccentric disk model of Tremaine (1995) fares better,
and can be improved somewhat by adjusting the original parameters. However,
detailed modeling will require dynamical models of significantly greater
realism.

Title:Spectral Synthesis of the Nuclear Region of Seyfert 2 and Radio Galaxies,"
Abstract:  We present the results of an optical spectral synthesis analysis for the
nuclei of 20 Seyfert 2 and 4 Radio Galaxies, using a base of stellar population
templates of different ages and metallicities and a power-law continuum.
Compared with the stellar population of elliptical galaxies, we find that
Seyfert 2s usually have a smaller contribution from old metal rich stars (10
Gyr, Z>=Z_o), and a larger contribution from stars with 100 Myr. We also find
that the contributions from stars with age <=10 Myr and from a power law
continuum are small, rarely exceeding 5 per cent. These results show that the
general assumption of elliptical galaxies as stellar population templates for
these objects is incorrect, also implying that the excess blue continuum
frequently found in their nuclear spectra is probably due to this template
mismatch. We find a considerable contribution from 100 Myr stars (~5 per cent),
which can be interpreted from the point of view of models where the fueling of
the AGN is done by interactions/mergers.

Abstract:  A survey of extended objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud was carried out on
the ESO/SERC R and J Sky Survey Atlases, checking entries in previous catalogs
and searching for new objects. The census provided 6659 objects including star
clusters, emission-free associations and objects related to emission nebulae.
Each of these classes contains 3 subclasses with intermediate properties, which
are used to infer total populations. The survey includes cross-identifications
among catalogs and we present 3246 new objects. We provide accurate positions,
classification, homogeneous measurements of sizes and position angles, as well
as information on cluster pairs and hierarchical relation for superimposed
objects. This unification and enlargement of catalogs is important for future
searches of fainter and smaller new objects. We discuss the angular and size
distributions of the objects of the different classes. The angular
distributions show two off-centered systems with different inclinations,
suggesting that the LMC disk is warped. The present catalog together with its
previous counterpart for the SMC and the inter-Cloud region provide a total
population of 7847 extended objects in the Magellanic System. The angular
distribution of the ensemble reveals important clues on the interaction between

Abstract:  The large-scale (~ 20') diffuse x-ray background surrounding a sample of
quasars observed during ROSAT PSPC pointed observations is studied using a new
source-detection algorithm, the scaling-index method. This algorithm, which can
identify individual photons as belonging to a source or background, is useful
for detecting faint, extended sources in noisy fields. Using this method, we
find that, contrary to conclusions drawn by others, there is scant evidence for
preferential enhancement of x-ray backgrounds surrounding radio-loud quasars by
foreground x-ray emitting clusters of galaxies. Rather, all fluctuations in
these backgrounds can be explained by varying levels of emission from a
galactic thermal plasma of temperature T ~ 0.14 keV. No difference is observed
between the diffuse x-ray backgrounds of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars.

as a peculiar hole-like feature East of the central star. There is definite

Title:A Gamma Ray Burst with a 220 Microsecond Rise Time and a Sharp Spectral Cutoff,"
Abstract:  The Gamma Ray Burst GRB920229 has four extreme and unprecedented properties;
a rise in brightness with an e-folding time scale of $220 \pm 30 \mu s$, a fall
in brightness with an e-folding time scale of $400 \pm 100 \mu s$, a large
change in spectral shape over a time of $768 \mu s$, and a sharp spectral
cutoff to high energies with $\Delta E/E = 18 %$. The rapid changes occur
during a spike in the light curve which was seen 0.164 s after the start of the
burst. The spectrum has a peak $\nu F_{\nu}$ at 200 keV with no significant
flux above 239 keV, although the cutoff energy shifts to less than 100 keV
during the decay of the spike. These numbers can be used to place severe limits
on fireball models of bursts. The thickness of the energy production region
must be smaller than $\sim 66 km$, ejected shells must have a dispersion of the
Lorentz factor of less than roughly 1% along a particular radius, and the
angular size of the radiation emission region is of order 1 arc-minute as
viewed from the burst center. The physical mechanism that caused the sharp
spectral cutoff has not been determined.

Abstract:  We have performed searches for isolated flares and for steady flickering in
Gamma Ray Burst light curves on the microsecond to millisecond time scales. Two
bursts out of our sample of 20 revealed four isolated flares with time scales
from $256 \mu s$ to $2048 \mu s$. A wavelet analysis for our sample showed low
level flickering for all bursts on time scales from $256 \mu s$ to 33 ms, with
the majority of bursts containing rise times faster than four milliseconds and
30% having rise times faster than one millisecond. These results show that
millisecond variability is common in classical bursts and not some exceptional
activity by a possibly separate class of bursts. These fast rise times can be
used to place severe limits on burst models: (1) The characteristic thickness
of the energy generation region must be less than 1200 km along the line of
sight. (2) The angular size of the gamma ray emission region as subtended from
the central source must be less than 42 arc-seconds. (3) The expanding ejecta
must have a range of Lorentz factors along a radius line with a dispersion of
less than roughly 2%. (4) Within the external shock scenario, the
characteristic dimension of the impacted cloud must be smaller than 16
Astronomical Units on average. (5) Within the collimated jet scenario, the
collimation angle must be smaller than 42 arc-seconds.

resolved, indicating optically thick thermalized emission, as expected for a
standard BLR. 2) Lines from ions of increasing ionization level show increasing
excess blue wing flux, and an increasing line peak velocity shift, suggesting
an out-flowing component of the BLR, visible only in the approaching direction,
where the ionization level increases with velocity. 3) A weak associated UV
absorption system is detected in N V, C IV, Si IV and Lya, which is probably
part of the outflow suggested above. 4) The C III] 1909 line indicates a BLR
density about an order of magnitude larger than commonly observed in quasars.
An additional denser component is implied by the Al III 1857 doublet. 5)
Prominent Fe II and FeIII emission is seen, including components which may

Abstract:  The advent of sensitive sub-mm array cameras now allows a proper census of
dust-enshrouded massive star-formation in very distant galaxies, previously
hidden activity to which even the deepest optical images are insensitive. We
present the deepest sub-mm survey, taken with the SCUBA camera on the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and centred on the Hubble Deep Field (HDF). The
high source density on this image implies that the survey is confusion-limited
below a flux density of 2 mJy. However within the central 80 arcsec radius
independent analyses yield 5 reproducible sources with S(850um) > 2 mJy which
simulations indicate can be ascribed to individual galaxies. These data lead to
integral source counts which are completely inconsistent with a no evolution
model, whilst the combined brightness of the 5 most secure sources in our map
is sufficient to account for 30-50% of the previously unresolved sub-mm
background, and statistically the entire background is resolved at about the
0.3 mJy level. Four of the five brightest sources appear to be associated with
galaxies which lie in the redshift range 2 < z < 4. With the caveat that this
is a small sample of sources detected in a small survey area, these submm data
imply a star-formation density over this redshift range that is at least five
times higher than that inferred from the rest-frame ultraviolet output of HDF
galaxies.

Abstract:  Using a two-dimensional hydrodynamics code (PROMETHEUS), we study the
continued evolution of rotating massive helium stars whose iron core collapse
does not produce a successful outgoing shock, but instead forms a black hole.
We study the formation of a disk, the associated flow patterns, and the
accretion rate for disk viscosity parameter, alpha ~ 0.001 and 0.1. For the
standard 14 solar mass model the average accretion rate for 15 s is 0.07 solar
masses per second and the total energy deposited along the rotational axes by
neutrino annihilation is (1 - 14) x 10**51 erg, depending upon the evolution of
the Kerr parameter and uncertain neutrino efficiencies. Simulated deposition of
this energy in the polar regions results in strong relativistic outflow - jets
beamed to about 1.5% of the sky. The jets remain highly focused, and are
capable of penetrating the star in 5 - 10 s. After the jet breaks through the
surface of the star, highly relativistic flow can commence. Because of the
sensitivity of the mass ejection and jets to accretion rate, angular momentum,
and disk viscosity, and the variation of observational consequences with
viewing angle, a large range of outcomes is possible ranging from bright GRBs
like GRB 971214 to faint GRB-supernovae like SN 1998bw. X-ray precursors are
also possible as the jet first breaks out of the star. While only a small
fraction of supernovae make GRBs, we predict that all GRBs longer than a few
seconds will make supernovae similar to SN 1998bw. However, hard, energetic
GRBs shorter than a few seconds will be difficult to make in this model.

Title:Morphological aspects of star formation in dwarf galaxies,"
Abstract:  We studied the morphology of star formation in dwarf irregular galaxies and
found that, in general, this takes place on one side of a galaxy and far from
the center. This is mainly true for low surface brightness galaxies; in high
surface brightness dwarf irregulars the star formation tends to be more
centrally concentrated, as well as being more intense. We discuss possible star
formation triggers in dwarf irregular galaxies, and evaluate the reasons for
the peculiar distribution of star forming regions of these galaxies. Stochastic
star formation, interactions with external gas, and tidal interactions appear
to be ruled out as responsible for the asymmetric pattern of star formation. We
conclude that asymmetry of a dark matter halo or of an asymmetric underlying
stellar distribution may trigger an asymmetric pattern of star formation.

galaxy and its two companions in the north-east. The intensity of the mid-IR
emission from the outer star forming ring of the Cartwheel shows considerable
azimuthal variation and peaks at the most active H$\alpha$ region of the ring.
The 15 $\mu m$ to 6.7 $\mu m$ flux ratio of 5.2 is the highest among all the
galaxies of our sample. A surprising result of our observations is the
discovery of significant emission from the inner regions of the galaxy,
including the inner ring, spokes and nucleus, where previously only low level
H$\alpha$ emission had been reported. At 6.7 $\mu m$, this emission is stronger
than the one from the outer star forming ring, and at 15 $\mu m$, it represents
40% of the emission from the outer ring. The H$\alpha$ to mid-IR flux ratios
from the inner regions are consistent with the heating of grains from weak star
formation activity.

Abstract:  We present an alternative, Bayesian method for large-scale reconstruction

real space or in k-space. A likelihood analysis is used to determine the
fluctuation power spectrum, followed by a Wiener Filter (WF) analysis to obtain
the minimum-variance mean fields of velocity and mass density. Constrained
Realizations (CR) are then used to sample the statistical scatter about the WF
mean field. The WF/CR method is applied as a demonstration to the Mark III data
with 1200 km/s, 900 km/s, and 500 km/s resolutions. The main reconstructed
structures are consistent with those extracted by the POTENT method. A
comparison with the structures in the distribution of IRAS 1.2Jy galaxies
yields a general agreement. The reconstructed velocity field is decomposed into
its divergent and tidal components relative to a cube of +/-8000 km/s centered
on the Local Group. The divergent component is very similar to the velocity
field predicted from the distribution of IRAS galaxies. The tidal component is
dominated by a bulk flow of 194 +/- 32 km/s towards the general direction of

Title:The effects of magnetic fields in cold clouds in cooling flows,"
Abstract:  Large masses of absorbing material are inferred to exist in cooling flows in
clusters of galaxies from the excess X-ray absorption in the spectra of some
X-ray clusters. The absorbing material is probably in the form of cold clouds
pressure-confined by the surrounding, hot, X-ray emitting gas. The cold clouds
could remain relatively static until they are destroyed by evaporation or
ablation, or give rise to star formation. If the final fate of the clouds is
stars, the IMF of the stars formed over the whole cooling flow region ($r \sim
100$ kpc) should be biased to low masses, to avoid a very luminous, blue halo
for the central galaxy of the cooling flow. However, there is evidence for
bright star formation in the innermost (r < 10 kpc) regions of some cooling
flows, and, therefore, the biasing of the IMF towards low masses should not
occur or be less important at smaller radii. The consideration of magnetic
fields may shed light on these two points. If magnetic fields are present, the
magnetic critical mass should be considered, besides the Jeans mass, in
establishing a natural mass scale for star formation. When this new mass scale
is taken into account, we obtain the right variation of the biasing of the IMF
with the radius in addition to inhibition of high-mass star formation at large
radii. We also demonstrate that magnetic reconnection is a efficient than
ambipolar diffusion in removing magnetic fields in cold clouds.

Title:Deep sub-mm surveys with SCUBA,"
Abstract:  We review published deep surveys in the submillimeter (sub-mm) regime from
the new Sub-millimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the 15-m James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Summarising the number
counts of faint sub-mm sources determined from the different surveys we show
that the deepest counts from our completed SCUBA Lens Survey, down to 0.5mJy at
850um fully account for the far-infrared background (FIRB) detected by COBE. We
conclude that a population of distant, dust-enshrouded ultraluminous infrared
galaxies dominate the FIRB emission around 1mm. We go on to discuss the nature
of this population, starting with the identification of their optical
counterparts, where we highlight the important role of deep VLA radio
observations in this process. Taking advantage of the extensive archival Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) observations of our fields, we then investigate the
morphological nature of the sub-mm galaxy population and show that a large
fraction exhibit disturbed or interacting morphologies. By employing existing
broadband photometry, we derive crude redshift limits for a complete sample of
faint sub-mm galaxies indicating that the majority lie at z<5, with at most 20%
at higher redshifts. We compare these limits to the initial spectroscopic
results from various sub-mm samples. Finally we discuss the nature of the
sub-mm population, its relationship to other classes of high-redshift galaxies
and its future role in our understanding of the formation of massive galaxies.

Title:Vela X-1 as seen by RXTE,"
Abstract:  We present results from four observations of the accreting X-ray pulsar Vela
X-1 with RXTE in 1996 February.
The light curves show strong pulse to pulse variations, while the average
pulse profiles are quite stable, similar to previous results. Below 5keV the
pulse profiles display a complex, 5-peaked structure with a transition to a
simple, double peak above about 15keV.
We analyze phase-averaged, phase-resolved, and on-pulse minus off-pulse
spectra. The best spectral fits were obtained using continuum models with a
smooth high-energy turnover. In contrast, the commonly used power law with
exponential cutoff introduced artificial features in the fit residuals. Using a
power law with a Fermi-Dirac cutoff modified by photoelectric absorption and an
iron line, the best fit spectra are still unacceptable. We interpret large
deviations around 25 and 55keV as fundamental and second harmonic cyclotron
absorption lines. If this result holds true, the ratio of the line energies
seems to be larger than 2. Phase resolved spectra show that the cyclotron lines
are strongest on the main pulse while they are barely visible outside the
pulses.

Title:H-dibaryons and Primordial Nucleosynthesis,"
Abstract:  The apparent discrepancy between abundances of light nuclides predicted by
the standard Big-Bang and observational data is explained, by assuming the
presence of metastable H dibaryons at the nucleosynthesis era. These dibaryons
could be formed out of a small fraction of strange quarks at the moment of the
confinement transition. For a primordial deuterium abundance of the order of 3
10^{-5}, the measured differences in the 4He abundances requires a relative
abundance of H dibaryons of the order of n_H/n_B = 0.07, decaying in a
timescale of the order of 10^5 s.

Title:Kaon Condensation and Dynamical Nucleons in Neutron Stars,"
Abstract:  We discuss the nature of the kaon condensation phase transition. We find
several features which, if kaons condense in neutron stars, are not only
remarkable, but must surely effect such properties as superfluidity and
transport properties, which in turn are relevant to the glitch phenomenon and
cooling rates of neutron stars. The mixed phase, because of the extensive
pressure range that it spans, will occupy a broad radial extent in a neutron
star. This region is permeated with microscopic drops (and other
configurations) located at lattice sites of one phase immersed in the
background of the other phase. The electric charge on drops is opposite to that
of the background phase {\sl and} nucleons have a mass approximately a factor
two different depending on whether they are in the drops or the background
phase. A large part of the stellar interior has this highly non-homogeneous
structure.

Title:Velocity peaks and caustic rings,"
Abstract:  The late infall of cold dark matter onto an isolated galaxy produces flows
with definite local velocity vectors throughout the galactic halo. It also
produces caustic rings, which are places in the halo where the dark matter
density is very large. The self-similar model of halo formation predicts that
the caustic ring radii $a_n$ follow the approximate law $a_n \simeq 1/n$. I
interpret bumps in the rotation curves of NGC 3198 and of our own galaxy as due
to caustic rings of dark matter. In this model of our halo the annual
modulation effect in direct searches for WIMPs has the opposite sign from that
predicted by the isothermal sphere model.

Title:A Statistical Study of Rest-frame Optical Emission Properties in Luminous Quasars at 2.0 < z < 2.5,"
Abstract:  We have obtained H-band spectra of 32 luminous quasars at 2.0<z<2.5 with the
Multiple Mirror Telescope. The sample contains 15 radio-loud quasars (RLQs) and
17 radio-quiet quasars (RQQs). We have measured emission line properties from
the rest-frame wavelength range of approximately 4500-5500 Angstroms, by
fitting the data with composite model spectra. Our analysis includes comparison
of RLQs versus RQQs, as well as comparison between the broad-absorption-line
quasar (BALQSO) and non-broad-absorption-line quasar (nonBALQSO) subsets of the
RQQ sample. In addition, we calculated the complete correlation matrix of the
measured properties. We combined our high redshift sample with the sample of 87
low redshift quasars from Boroson & Green (1992) to determine the luminosity
and redshift dependences of the measured emission properties. Our main results
are: (1) The RLQ sample has significantly stronger [O III]5007 emission than
the RQQ sample. (2) The RLQ sample has significantly narrower (in FWHM) Hbeta
broad component line profiles than the RQQ sample. (3) At the sensitivity of
our observations, there are no statistically significant (>95%) differences
between the rest-frame optical emission line properties of the BALQSO and
nonBALQSO subsamples. This result is consistent with the view that all RQQs
have broad-absorption-line clouds with a small (~10-20%) covering factor and
that differences between the two types are merely a function of viewing angle
and covering factor. (4) We report a previously unknown luminosity and/or
redshift dependence of the narrow-line-region velocity width over the range
0<z<2.5, such that emission line widths increase with increasing luminosity.
Furthermore, we find a ``Baldwin Effect'' for the [O III]5007 line in the
RQQ-only sample over this same range in redshifts.

"Title:The Thermal X-ray Spectra of Cen X-4, Aql X-1, and 4U 1608-522 in Quiescence","
Abstract:  We re-analyze the available X-ray spectral data of the type I bursting
neutron star transients Aql X-1, Cen X-4, and 4U 1608-522 using realistic
hydrogen atmosphere models. Previous spectral fits assumed a blackbody
spectrum; because the free-free dominated photospheric opacity decreases with
increasing frequency, blackbody spectral fits overestimate the effective
temperature and underestimate, by as much as two orders of magnitude, the
emitting area. Hydrogen atmosphere spectral models, when fit to the available
observational data, imply systematically larger emission area radii, consistent
with the canonical 10 km radius of a neutron star. This suggests that a
substantial fraction of the quiescent luminosity is thermal emission from the
surface of the neutron star. The magnitude of the equivalent hydrogen column
density toward these systems, however, presents a considerable systematic
uncertainty, which can only be eliminated by high signal-to-noise X-ray
spectral measurements (e.g., with AXAF or XMM) which would permit simultaneous
determination of the equivalent hydrogen column density, emission area, and
thermal temperature.

"Title:A Wavelet Exploration of the Q0957+561 A,B brightness Record","
Abstract:  We analyze the Q0957+561 A,B brightness record with 3 types of wavelets to
define properties that are independent of the nature of the analyzing wavelet.
The wavelet analysis picks out features having arbitrary shape, and localizes
them in time and fits amplitudes.
We find that independently of the analyzing wavelet, the mean wavelet
amplitude is zero, meaning that there are as many positive as negative
brightness spikes. For all wavelet durations the fitted amplitudes are equal in
the A and B images, except that image B may have larger amplitude brightness
fluctuations for the longest duration 64-day features. Independently of the
wavelet family fitted or of the kind of statistical measure of wavelet
amplitude, the fitted amplitudes seem to increase as a linear function of the
wavelet duration, with the mean absolute deviation about a factor of 10 greater
for 64-day wavelets than for 2-day wavelets. The underlying physical process
producing the brightness fluctuations is found to have more power in long
duration wavelets than in short duration wavelets than a process dominated by
white noise. Thus it is established that the rapid brightness fluctuations
observed in the Q0957 images A and B are not the result of observational noise.

Title:First Order Kaon Condensate,"
Abstract:  First order Bose condensation in asymmetric nuclear matter and in neutron
stars is studied, with particular reference to kaon condensation. We
demonstrate explicitly why the Maxwell construction fails to assure equilibrium
in multicomponent substances. Gibbs conditions and conservation laws require
that for phase equilibrium, the charge density must have opposite sign in the
two phases of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. The mixed phase will therefore
form a Coulomb lattice with the rare phase occupying lattice sites in the
dominant phase. Moreover, the kaon condensed phase differs from the normal
phase, not by the mere presence of kaons in the first, but also by a difference
in the nucleon effective masses. The mixed phase region, which occupies a large
radial extent amounting to some kilometers in our model neutron stars, is thus
highly heterogeneous. It should be particularly interesting in connection with
the pulsar glitch phenomenon as well as transport properties.

Title:Disk galaxy formation and evolution: models up to intermediate redshifts,"
Abstract:  Making use of a seminumerical method we develop a scenario of disk galaxy
formation and evolution in the framework of inflationary cold dark matter (CDM)
cosmologies. Within the virializing dark matter halos, disks in centrifugal
equilibrium are built-up and their galactic evolution is followed through an
approach which considers the gravitational interactions among the galaxy
components, the turbulence and energy balance of the ISM, the star formation
(SF) process due to disk gravitational instabilities, the stellar evolution and
the secular formation of a bulge. We find that the main properties and
correlations of disk galaxies are determined by the mass, the hierarchical mass
aggregation history and the primordial angular momentum. The models follow the
same trends across the Hubble sequence than the observed galaxies. The
predicted TF relation is in good agreement with the observations except for the
standart CDM. While the slope of this relation remains almost constant up to
intermediate redshifts, its zero-point decreases in the H-band and slightly
increases in the B-band. A maximum in the SF rate for most of the models is
attained at $z\sim 1.5-2.5$.

Title:An Additional Application of the Space Interferometry Mission to Gravitational Microlensing Experiments,"
Abstract:  Despite the detection of a large number of gravitational microlensing events,
the nature of Galactic dark matter remains very uncertain. This uncertainty is
due to two major reasons: the lens parameter degeneracy in the measured
Einstein timescale and the blending problem in dense field photometry.
Recently, consideration has been given to routine astrometric followup
observations of lensing events using the {\it Space Interferometry Mission}
(SIM) as a means of breaking the lens parameter degeneracy in microlensing
events. In this paper, we show that in addition to breaking the lens parameter
degeneracy, SIM observations can also be used to correct for nearly all types
of blending. Therefore, by resolving both the problems of the lens parameter
degeneracy and blending, SIM observations of gravitational lensing events will
significantly better constrain the nature of Galactic dark matter.

Title:A dichotomy between HSB and LSB galaxies,"
Abstract:  A complete sample of spiral galaxies in the Ursa Major cluster is imaged at
various optical wavelengths and in the Near-Infrared K'-band. HI rotation
curves were obtained for all gas rich systems. The Near-Infrared surface
brightness distribution of disk galaxies turns out to be bimodal; galaxies
avoid a domain around a face-on disk central surface brightness of 18.5
mag/arcsec^2. This bimodality is particularly striking when only the more
isolated, non-interacting systems are considered. The Luminosity Function of
the HSB family of galaxies is truncated well above the completion limit while
the Luminosity Function of the LSB family is still sharply rising at our
limiting magnitude. Near-Infrared mass-to-light ratios suggest that HSB
galaxies are close to a kinematic maximum-disk situation while LSB galaxies are
dark matter dominated at all radii. Assuming equal Near-Infrared mass-to-light
ratios for both HSB and LSB systems, we find that the gap in the surface
brightness distribution corresponds to a situation in which the baryonic mass
is marginally self-gravitating. We finally conclude that the luminosity-line
width relation is a fundamental correlation between the amount and distribution
of dark matter mass and the total luminosity, regardless of how the luminous
mass is distributed within the dark mater halo.

Title:Antibiasing: High Mass-to-Light Ratios in Dense Clusters,"
Abstract:  Modeling of the velocity field of the Local Supercluster leads to the
conclusion that there must be a substantial differential between the
mass-to-light ratios of most galaxies and those in a small number of special
places. Specifically, M/L=1000 is indicated for the full Virgo Cluster while
M/L=150 is appropriate for most environments. It is argued that a higher M/L
value is characteristic of E/S0 knots, regions where the galaxy density is high
and collapse time scales are short. Regions larger than galaxies where collapse
is ocurring only on the order of the age of the universe, the environment where
spirals and irregulars predominate, are characterized by a low M/L. Overall,
the mean density of the universe is well below closure. There could be
comparable total mass in the relatively rare E/S0 knots as there is in the
environments dominated by spirals and irregulars.

Title:Emission within a Damped Lyman Alpha Absorption Trough: the Complex Sight Line Towards Q2059-360,"
Abstract:  We present new spectroscopic observations of the quasar Q2059-360, confirming
the existence of an emission feature within the Damped Lyman Alpha (DLA)
absorption trough. By observing also at slit positions offset from the quasar,
we show that the emission is spatially extended by at least a few arcseconds,
and hence confirm that the feature seen must be due to emission rather than
unusual absorption characteristics. We find that the DLA trough is very close
in redshift to the broad Lyman~$\alpha$ emission line of the QSO, with the
result that the DLA absorption removes much of the peak region of that line.
Despite the similarity of the redshifts of the DLA and the QSO, the lack of
high-ionization lines of the DLA system and the unresolved widths of the
corresponding metal lines indicate that the DLA cloud is not an associated
system. The emission feature has a large velocity offset of +490 km/s with
respect to the DLA system, and is resolved in velocity, comprising two
components with a separation of ~ 300 km/s. We consider three possibilities:
(1) Both emission and absorption occur within an object similar to the high
redshift Lyman-break galaxies; (2) The emission feature arises from an object
distinct from both the DLA absorber and the QSO, perhaps a young star-forming
galaxy or a proto-galactic clump. It could be associated with the DLA absorber
and perhaps the QSO in a compact group or cluster; (3) The redshifts are such
that the emission feature could be due to Narrow Line Region filaments of the
QSO, if the DLA absorption covers a sufficiently small angular size to allow
the filaments to be seen beyond the edge of the DLA cloud.

Title:Dwarf Irregular Galaxies and the Intergalactic Medium,"
Abstract:  Dwarf galaxies (DGs) are more numerous than large galaxies. Most dwarfs in
clusters are dEs, but in the field they belong mostly to late types. The
importance of late-type DGs in the context of the intergalactic medium (IGM)
lies in the fact that (at least some) are probably ``young'' galaxies forming
stars for the first time. Many DGs have significant amounts of interstellar
gas, they may form out of intergalactic gas clouds, and matter ejected from
such galaxies as a result of star formation processes may enrich the IGM with
metals. The physical mechanism responsible for triggering the star formation
process has not yet been identified. The extended halos of DGs may provide (at
least some of) the QSO absorption line systems. Recent observations also show
that the LSB dwarf galaxies may be good tests of MOND.

Title:Hints on Galaxy Formation from the Metal Content of Galaxy Cluster and Other Fossil Evidence,"
Abstract:  Clusters of galaxies allow a direct estimate of the metallicity and metal
production yield on the largest scale so far. It is argued that cluster
metallicity ($\sim 1/3$ solar) should be taken as representative of the low-$z$
universe as a whole. There is now compelling evidence that the bulk of stars
not only in cluster ellipticals but also in field ellipticals and bulges formed
at high redshifts ($z\gsim 3$). Since such stars account for at least $\sim
30%$ of the baryons now locked into stars, it is argued that at least 30% of
stars and metals formed before $z\simeq 3$, and correspondingly the metallicity
of the universe at $z=3$ is predicted to be $\sim 1/10$ solar. This requires
the cosmic star formation rate to run at least flat from $z\sim 1$ to $\sim 5$,
which appears to agree with the most recent derect determinations of the star
formation rate in Lyman-break galaxies.

Title:Dynamical models of NGC 3115,"
Abstract:  We present new dynamical models of the S0 galaxy N3115, making use of the
available published photometry and kinematics as well as of two-dimensional
TIGER spectrography. We first examined the kinematics in the central 40 arcsec
in the light of two integral f(E,J) models. Jeans equations were used to
constrain the mass to light ratio, and the central dark mass whose existence
was suggested by previous studies. The even part of the distribution function
was then retrieved via the Hunter & Qian formalism. We thus confirmed that the
velocity and dispersion profiles in the central region could be well fit with a
two-integral model, given the presence of a central dark mass of ~10^9 Msun.
However, no two integral model could fit the h_3 profile around a radius of 25
arcsec where the outer disc dominates the surface brightness distribution.
Three integral analytical models were therefore built using a Quadratic
Programming technique. These models showed that three integral components do
indeed provide a reasonable fit to the kinematics, including the higher
Gauss-Hermite moments. Again, models without a central dark mass failed to
reproduce the observed kinematics in the central arcseconds. This clearly
supports the presence of a nuclear black hole of at least 6.5 10^8 Msun in the
centre of NGC 3115. These models were finally used to estimate the importance
of the dark matter in the outer part of NGC 3115, suggested by the flat stellar
rotation curve observed by Capaccioli et al. (1993).

Title:A search for soft X-ray emission associated with prominent high-velocity-cloud complexes,"
Abstract:  We correlate the ROSAT 1/4 keV all-sky survey with the Leiden/Dwingeloo HI
survey, looking for soft X-ray signatures of prominent high-velocity-cloud
(HVC) complexes. We study the transfer of 1/4 keV photons through the
interstellar medium in order to distinguish variations in the soft X-ray
background (SXRB) intensity caused by photoelectric absorption effects from
those due to excess X-ray emission. The X-ray data are modelled as a
combination of emission from the Local Hot Bubble (LHB) and emission from a
distant plasma in the galactic halo and extragalactic sources. The X-ray
radiation intensity of the galactic halo and extragalactic X-ray background is
modulated by the photoelectric absorption of the intervening galactic
interstellar matter. We show that large- and small-scale intensity variations
of the 1/4 keV SXRB are caused by photoelectric absorption which is
predominantly traced by the total N(HI) distribution. The extensive coverage of
the two surveys supports evidence for a hot, X-ray emitting corona. We show
that this leads to a good representation of the SXRB observations. For four
large areas on the sky, we search for regions where the modelled and observed
X-ray emission differ. We find that there is excess X-ray emission towards
regions near HVC complexes C, D, and GCN. We suggest that the excess X-ray
emission is positionally correlated with the high-velocity clouds. Some lines
of sight towards HVCs also pass through significant amounts of
intermediate-velocity gas, so we cannot constrain the possible role played by
IVC gas in these directions of HVC and IVC overlap, in determining the X-ray
excesses.

Title:Theoretical expectations and experimental prospects for solar axions searches with crystal detectors,"
Abstract:  A calculation of the expected signal due to Primakov coherent conversion of
solar axions into photons via Bragg scattering in several solid--state
detectors is presented and compared with present and future experimental
sensitivities. The axion window m_a>~0.03 eV (not accessible at present by
other techniques) could be explored in the foreseeable future with crystal
detectors to constrain the axion--photon coupling constant below the latest
bounds coming from helioseismology. On the contrary a positive signal in the
sensitivity region of such devices would imply revisiting other more stringent
astrophysical limits derived for the same range of the axion mass.

Title:HST Observations of the Broad Absorption Line Quasar PG 0946+301,"
Abstract:  We analyze HST and ground based spectra of the brightest BALQSO in the UV:
PG~0946+301. A detailed study of the absorption troughs as a function of
velocity is presented, facilitated by the use of a new algorithm to solve for
the optical depth as a function of velocity for multiplet lines. We find
convincing evidence for saturation in parts of the troughs. This supports our
previous assertion that saturation is common in BALs and therefore cast doubts
on claims for very high metallicity in BAL flows. Due to the importance of BAL
saturation we also discuss its evidence in other objects. In PG~0946+301 large
differences in ionization as a function of velocity are detected and our
findings supports the hypothesis that the line of sight intersects a number of
flow components that combine to give the appearance of the whole trough. Based
on the optical depth profiles, we develop a geometrical-kinematical model for
the flow. We have positively identified 16 ions of 8 elements (H~I, C~III,
C~IV, N~III, N~IV, N~V, O~III, O~IV, O~V, O~VI, Ne~V, Ne~VIII, P~V, Si~IV, S~V,

analysis of IUE data, we find no evidence for BALs arising from excited ionic
states in the HST spectrum of PG~0946+301.

Title:Bright Stars and Metallicity Spread in the Globular Cluster Omega Centauri,"
Abstract:  The globular cluster Omega Centauri (NGC 5139) is the most massive and
brightest cluster in our Galaxy. It has also a moderately high mass to light
ratio (3.6) and an anomalous flattening (0.83) for a globular cluster. This
cluster is also very interesting because it is one of a few examples of
globular clusters with a measurable spread in the metal abundance (see Da Costa
& Willumsen 1981, Norris et al. 1996, and Suntzeff and Kraft 1996 and
references therein) and then it offers a unique, big sample of nearby stars
having all the same distance and reddening but showing different metallicity
(and age ?) effects. A recent paper by Norris et al. (1997) shows also an
interesting correlation between kinematics and metal abundance.

Title:Towards an accurate determination of the age of the Universe,"
Abstract:  In the past 40 years a considerable effort has been focused in determining
the age of the Universe at zero redshift using several stellar clocks. In this
review I will describe the best theoretical methods to determine the age of the
oldest Galactic Globular Clusters (GC). I will also argue that a more accurate
age determination may come from passively evolving high-redshift ellipticals.
In particular, I will review two new methods to determine the age of GC. These
two methods are more accurate than the classical isochrone fitting technique.
The first method is based on the morphology of the horizontal branch and is
independent of the distance modulus of the globular cluster. The second method
uses a careful binning of the stellar luminosity function which determines
simultaneously the distance and age of the GC. It is found that the oldest GCs
have an age of $13.5 \pm 2$ Gyr. The absolute minimum age for the oldest GCs is
10.5 Gyr and the maximum is 16.0 Gyr (with 99% confidence). Therefore, an
Einstein-De Sitter Universe ($\Omega=1$) is not totally ruled out if the Hubble
constant is about $65 \pm 10$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. On the other hand, the
newly discovered red elliptical 53W069 ($z=1.43$) provides an stronger
constraint since its minimun age is 3.2 Gyr, thus ruling out an Einstein-De
Sitter Universe unless the Hubble constant is $\leq 45 \pm 10$ km s$^{-1}$.
Using 53W069 we find an age at $z=0$ of $13 \pm 2$ Gyr, in excellent agreement
with the GC determination.

Title:Two Species of the Local Group Dwarf Spheroidals,"
Abstract:  We analyzed 10 dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the Local Group, and
found two distinct sequences on the $M_{\rm vir} / L$ -- $M_{\rm vir}$ plane:
$M_{\rm vir} / L \propto M_{\rm vir}^{1.6}$ for $M_{\rm vir} < 10^8 M_\odot$
whereas $M_{\rm vir} / L \simeq {\rm const.}$ for $M_{\rm vir} > 10^8 M_\odot$
($M_{\rm vir}$ and $L$ are the virial mass and the total luminosity of a dSph,
respectively). We interpret the disconuity as the threshold for the gas in
dSphs to be blown away by successive supernovae. We succeeded to give a
quantitative explanation of the discontinuity mass of $10^8M_\odot$ as
blow-away condition. We further derived the above relation for the low-mass
dSphs, assuming that the initial star formation rate of the dSphs is
proportional to the inverse of the cooling time. The relation of high-mass
dSphs is also explained along with the same consideration, with the condition
that the gas cannot been blown away effectively.

Title:Cosmic microwave background anisotropies seeded by coherent topological defects : a semi-analytic approach,"
Abstract:  We consider a perfectly homogeneous, isotropic and spatially flat universe
which undergoes a sudden phase transition producing topological defects. We
assume that these defects form a coherent network which scales like the
background density during the radiation and matter dominated eras, and describe
them in terms of a few free functions. We carefully model the loss of scaling
invariance during the transition from radiation to matter dominated era. We
choose a simple set for the free functions, compute the microwave background
temperature anisotropies generated by such a network, and compare our results
to previous calculations.

Title:The extraordinary X-ray spectrum of XTE J0421+560,"
Abstract:  We report results of two BeppoSAX observations of the transient X-ray source
XTE J0421+560 during the outburst that started in March 1998. The source
exhibits radio jets and coincides with the binary system CI Cam. The 0.1--50
keV spectrum is unlike those of other X-ray transients, and cannot be fit with
any simple model. The spectra can be represented by an absorbed two component
bremsstrahlung model with narrow Gaussian emission features identified with O,
Ne/Fe-L, Si, S, Ca and Fe-K. During the second observation (TOO2) the energies
of the O and the Ne/Fe-L features decreased smoothly by ~9% over an interval of
30 hrs. No significant energy shift of the other lines is detected with e.g, a
90% confidence upper limit to any Fe-K line shift of 3.5%. No moving lines were
detected during the first observation (TOO1) with e.g., an upper limit of <1.4%
to any shift of the Fe-K line. The low-energy absorption decreased by a factor
>=1.8 from ~6 10E21 atom cm/2 between TOO1 and TOO2. We propose that the time
variable emission lines arise in precessing relativistic jets, while the
stationary lines originate in circumstellar material.

Title:The CV Period Minimum,"
Abstract:  Using improved, up-to-date stellar input physics tested against observations
of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs we calculate the secular evolution of
low-mass donor CVs, including those which form with a brown dwarf donor star.
Our models confirm the mismatch between the calculated minimum period (P_min ~
70min) and the observed short-period cut-off (~80min) in the CV period
histogram. Theoretical period distributions synthesized from our model
sequences always show an accumulation of systems at the minimum period, a
feature absent in the observed distribution. We suggest that non-magnetic CVs
become unobservable as they are effectively trapped in permanent quiescence
before they reach P_min, and that small-number statistics may hide the period
spike for magnetic CVs. We calculate the minimum period for high mass transfer
rate sequences and discuss the relevance of these for explaining the location
of CV secondaries in the orbital period - spectral type diagram. We also show
that a recently suggested revised mass-radius relation for low-mass
main-sequence stars cannot explain the CV period gap.

Title:ASCA and contemporaneous ground-based observations of the BL Lacertae objects 1749+096 and 2200+420 (BL Lac),"
Abstract:  We present ASCA observations of the radio-selected BL Lacertae objects
1749+096 (z=0.32) and 2200+420 (BL Lac, z=0.069) performed in 1995 Sept and
Nov, respectively. The ASCA spectra of both sources can be described as a first
approximation by a power law with photon index Gamma ~ 2. This is flatter than
for most X-ray-selected BL Lacs observed with ASCA, in agreement with the
predictions of current blazar unification models. While 1749+096 exhibits
tentative evidence for spectral flattening at low energies, a concave continuum
is detected for 2200+420: the steep low-energy component is consistent the
high-energy tail of the synchrotron emission responsible for the longer
wavelengths, while the harder tail at higher energies is the onset of the
Compton component. The spectral energy distributions from radio to gamma-rays
are consistent with synchrotron-self Compton emission from a single homogeneous
region shortward of the IR/optical wavelengths, with a second component in the
radio domain related to a more extended emission region. For 2200+420,
comparing the 1995 Nov state with the optical/GeV flare of 1997 July, we find
that models requiring inverse Compton scattering of external photons provide a
viable mechanism for the production of the highest (GeV) energies during the
flare. An increase of the external radiation density and of the power injected
in the jet can reproduce the flat gamma-ray continuum observed in 1997 July. A
directly testable prediction of this model is that the line luminosity in
2200+420 should vary shortly after (~1 month) a non-thermal synchrotron flare.

Title:The Distribution of Nearby Stars in Velocity Space,"
Abstract:  From the tangential velocities of stars all over the sky, one can, in a
statistical way, infer their 3D velocity distribution. An application to
Hipparcos data reveals rich structure in the planar stellar motions: there are
several moving groups, increasing in number with stellar type but decreasing in
importance. A distinct group of outward moving stars with low rotation
velocities might be associated with the Galactic bar: growing a bar in a smooth
model for the Galactic disk results in such a group, provided the Sun is
outside the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) and the orientation angle with the
bar is in the first quadrant.
The vertical motions show less structure, but the mean <v_z> increases for
large rotational velocities, which can be nicely explained by a warp of the
outer stellar disk.

Title:The Spectroscopic Detectability of Argon in the Lunar Atmosphere,"
Abstract:  Direct measurements of the abundance of argon in the lunar atmosphere were
made in 1973 by instruments placed on the Moon during the Apollo 17 mission,
but the total daytime abundance is unknown due to instrument saturation
effects; thus, until we are able to return to the Moon for improved direct
measurements, we must use remote sensing to establish the daytime abundance. In
this paper, we present a complete analysis of the potential for measuring argon
in the lunar atmosphere via emission-line or absorption-line observations. We
come to the surprising conclusion that the lower limit established by the in
situ lunar argon measurements implies that any absorption-line measurement of
argon in the lower, dayside lunar atmosphere requires analysis in the
optically-thick regime. In light of this result, we present the results of our
EUVS sounding rocket observations of the lunar occultation of Spica, which
provide a new upper limit on the abundance of argon in the daytime lunar
atmosphere. We also re-analyze a recently reported weak detection of lunar
atmospheric Ar I 1048 in emission by the ORFEUS satellite, and show that those
data are inconsistent with the emission being due to argon over a wide range of
temperatures. This result is primarily due to our use of a more complete curve
of growth analysis, and improved values for the argon fluorescent emission
rates from radiation and solar wind interactions. We find that the detection
reported by ORFEUS would imply an argon surface density significantly greater
than the total surface density of the lunar atmosphere for argon accommodated
to typical daytime surface temperatures (~400 K), and also is inconsistent with
a high-density transient event. We conclude that the reported argon detection
is untenable.

Title:Black Hole and Neutron Star Transients in Quiescence,"
Abstract:  We consider the X-ray luminosity difference between neutron star and black
hole soft X-ray transients (NS and BH SXTs) in quiescence. The current
observational data suggest that BH SXTs are significantly fainter than NS SXTs.
The luminosities of quiescent BH SXTs are consistent with the predictions of
binary evolution models for the mass transfer rate if (1) accretion occurs via
an ADAF in these systems and (2) the accreting compact objects have event
horizons. The luminosities of quiescent NS SXTs are not consistent with the
predictions of ADAF models when combined with binary evolution models, unless
most of the mass accreted in the ADAF is prevented from reaching the neutron
star surface. We consider the possibility that mass accretion is reduced in
quiescent NS SXTs because of an efficient propeller and develop a model of the
propeller effect that accounts for the observed luminosities. We argue that
modest winds from ADAFs are consistent with the observations while strong winds
are probably not.

Title:Dynamical Friction in a Gaseous Medium,"
Abstract:  Using time-dependent linear perturbation theory, we evaluate the dynamical
friction force on a massive perturber M_p traveling at velocity V through a
uniform gaseous medium of density rho_0 and sound speed c_s. This drag force
acts in the direction -\hat V, and arises from the gravitational attraction
between the perturber and its wake in the ambient medium. For supersonic motion
(M=V/c_s>1), the enhanced-density wake is confined to the Mach cone trailing
the perturber; for subsonic motion (M<1), the wake is confined to a sphere of
radius c_s t centered a distance V t behind the perturber. Inside the wake,
surfaces of constant density are hyperboloids or oblate spheroids for
supersonic or subsonic perturbers, respectively, with the density maximal
nearest the perturber. The dynamical drag force has the form F_df= - I 4\pi (G
M_p)^2\rho_0/V^2. We evaluate I analytically; its limits are I\to M^3/3 for
M<<1 and I\to ln(Vt/r_min) for M>>1. We compare our results to the
Chandrasekhar formula for dynamical friction in a collisionless medium, noting
that the gaseous drag is generally more efficient when M>1 but less efficient
when M<1. To allow simple estimates of orbit evolution in a gaseous protogalaxy
or proto-star cluster, we use our formulae to evaluate the decay times of a
(supersonic) perturber on a near-circular orbit in an isothermal \rho\propto
r^{-2} halo, and of a (subsonic) perturber on a near-circular orbit in a
constant-density core. We also mention the relevance of our calculations to
protoplanet migration in a circumstellar nebula.

Title:Counterrotating Nuclear Disks in Arp 220,"
Abstract:  The ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220 has been observed at 0.5""
resolution in CO(2-1) and 1 mm continuum using the newly expanded Owens Valley
Millimeter Array. The CO and continuum peaks at the double nuclei and the
surrounding molecular gas disk are clearly resolved. We find steep velocity
gradients across each nucleus (dV ~ 500 km/s within r= 0.3"") whose directions
are not aligned with each other and with that of the outer gas disk. We
conclude that the double nuclei have their own gas disks (r ~ 100 pc). They are
counterrotating with respect to each other and embedded in the outer gas disk
(r ~ 1 kpc) rotating around the dynamical center of the system. The masses of
each nucleus are M_dyn > 2* 10^9 M_sun based on the CO kinematics. Although
there is no evidence of an old stellar population in the optical or near
infrared spectroscopy of the nuclei (probably due to the much brighter young
population), it seems likely that these nuclei were 'seeded' from the
pre-merger nuclei in view of their counterrotating gas kinematics. The gas
disks probably constitute a significant fraction (~ 50 %) of the mass in each
nucleus. The CO and continuum brightness temperatures imply that the nuclear
gas disks have high area filling factors (~ 0.5-1) and have extremely high
visual extinctions (Av ~ 1000 mag). The molecular gas must be hot (>= 40 K) and
dense (>= 10^4-5 cm^-3), given the large mass and small scale-height of the
nuclear disks. The continuum data suggest that the large luminosity (be it
starburst or AGN) must originate within 100 pc of the two nuclear gas disks
which were presumably formed through concentration of gas from the progenitor
outer galaxy disks.

Title:Spectral Hardness Decay with Respect to Fluence in BATSE Gamma-Ray Bursts,"
Abstract:  We have analyzed the evolution of the spectral hardness parameter Epk as a
function of fluence in gamma-ray bursts. We fit 41 pulses within 26 bursts with
the trend reported by Liang & Kargatis (1996) which found that Epk decays
exponentially with respect to photon fluence. We also fit these pulses with a
slight modification of this trend, where Epk decays linearly with energy
fluence. In both cases, we found the set of 41 pulses to be consistent with the
trend. For the latter trend, which we believe to be more physical, the
distribution of the decay constant is roughly log-normal, with a mean of 1.75
+/- 0.07 and a FWHM of 1.0 +/- 0.1. Regarding an earlier reported invariance in
the decay constant among different pulses in a single burst, we found
probabilities of 0.49 to 0.84 (depending on the test used) that such invariance
would occur by coincidence, most likely due to the narrow distribution of decay
constant values among pulses.

Abstract:  Gravitational interaction of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons with
matter perturbations present along the line-of-sight to the surface of last
scattering modifies the shape of the CMB anisotropy power spectrum. Here I
focus on (linear) integrated Sachs-Wolfe and (non-linear) gravitational lensing
effects and discuss the detectability of the resulting distortions and their
possible consequences for the CMB-based estimation of cosmological parameters.
Specifically, I discuss if any of those effects may allow us to use CMB
experiments to put independent constraints on the curvature of the universe and
the cosmological constant, i.e. breaking the so-called geometrical degeneracy
in CMB parameter estimation discussed by Bond, Efstathiou and Tegmark (1997)

I address that issue using the Fisher matrix approach and show that
gravitational lensing of the CMB temperature and polarisation patterns might be
detectable by the Planck Surveyor satellite, leading to useful independent and
precise constraints on the cosmological constant and spatial curvature. The
integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect though bound to restrict those parameters only
very weakly still may set constraints more stringent than those currently
available.

Title:Correlated errors in Hipparcos parallaxes towards the Pleiades and the Hyades,"
Abstract:  We show that the errors in the Hipparcos parallaxes towards the Pleiades and
the Hyades open clusters are spatially correlated over angular scales of 2 to 3
deg, with an amplitude of up to 2 mas. This correlation is stronger than
expected based on the analysis of the Hipparcos catalog. We predict the
parallaxes of individual cluster members, pi_pm, from their Hipparcos proper
motions, assuming that all cluster members have the same space velocity. We
compare pi_pm with their Hipparcos parallaxes, pi_Hip, and find that there are
significant spatial correlations in pi_Hip. We derive a distance modulus to the
Pleiades of 5.58 +- 0.18 mag using the radial-velocity gradient method. This
value, agrees very well with the distance modulus of 5.60 +- 0.04 mag
determined using the main-sequence fitting technique, compared with the value
of 5.33 +- 0.06 inferred from the average of the Hipparcos parallaxes of the
Pleiades members. We show that the difference between the main-sequence fitting
distance and the Hipparcos parallax distance can arise from spatially
correlated errors in the Hipparcos parallaxes of individual Pleiades members.
Although the Hipparcos parallax errors towards the Hyades are spatially
correlated in a manner similar to those of the Pleiades, the center of the
Hyades is located on a node of this spatial structure. Therefore, the parallax
errors cancel out when the average distance is estimated, leading to a mean
Hyades distance modulus that agrees with the pre-Hipparcos value. We speculate
that these spatial correlations are also responsible for the discrepant
distances that are inferred using the mean Hipparcos parallaxes to some open
clusters. Finally, we note that our conclusions are based on a purely geometric
method and do not rely on any models of stellar isochrones.

Title:A Model of the Double Magnetic Cycle of the Sun,"
Abstract:  It has been argued that the solar magnetic cycle consists of two main
periodic components: a low-frequency component (Hale's 22-year cycle) and a
high-frequency component (quasi-biennial cycle). The existence of the double
magnetic cycle on the Sun is confirmed using Stanford, Mount Wilson and Kitt
Peak magnetograph data from 1976 to 1996 (solar cycles 21 and 22). In the frame
of the Parker's dynamo theory a model of the double magnetic cycle is
presented. This model is based on the idea of two dynamo sources separated in
space. The first source of the dynamo action is located near the bottom of the
convection zone, and the second operates near the top. The model is formulated
in terms of two coupled systems of non-linear differential equations. It is
demonstrated that in the case of weak interaction between the two dynamo
sources the basic features of the double magnetic cycle such as existence of
two component and observed temporal variations of high-frequency component can
be reproduced.

scales, from which it will be possible to extract estimates for cosmological
parameters. But the real Universe is a nasty, messy place, full of non-linear
astrophysics. It is certainly clear that MAP and Planck will fix the background
cosmology at an unprecedented level. However, they will have to contend with
everything that the Universe throws at them: multiple foregrounds; structure
formation effects; and other complications we haven't even thought of yet. Some
examples of such effects will be presented.
Only an ideal, theorist's universe can be described by a number of free
parameters in the single digits, while in reality it is likely that a greater
wealth of information waits to be discovered. These `higher-order' processes
should be considered as potentially measurable signals, rather than
contaminants. The capabilities of Planck seem ideally suited to fully
understanding the physics encoded in the microwave sky.

are interpreted using evolutionary models optimized for young starburst
regions. The massive stellar population is derived in a self-consistent way
using the continuum and stellar absorption lines in the ultraviolet and the
nebular emission line optical spectrum.
The central starburst has an age of about 4.5 Myr, with little evidence for
an age spread. Wolf-Rayet features at the ultraviolet indicates a stellar
population of $\sim$ 2000 Wolf-Rayet stars. The overall properties of the newly
formed stars are quite similar to those derived, e.g., in 30 Doradus. A
standard Salpeter IMF is consistent with all observational constraints. We find
evidence for spatial structure within the central 300 pc sampled. Therefore it
is unlikely that the nucleus of NGC 7714 hosts a single star cluster exceeding
the properties of other known clusters. Contrary to previous suggestions, we
find no evidence for a nuclear supernova rate that would significantly exceed
the total disk-integrated rate. About one supernova event per century is

Unlike the absorption edges, such as those of O VII and O VIII observed in soft
X-rays which are produced by the WA, these lines strongly constrain the
physical parameters of the WA, especially the hydrogen density. Indeed, in
order to avoid producing coronal line equivalent widths larger than observed, a
high density (nH \geq 10^{10} cm-3) is required for the WA in most cases. This
result is obtained for the mean observed Seyfert 1 features, as well as for the

Title:Rapid variability of BL Lacs and time lags: what can we learn?,"
Abstract:  The quasi-symmetric shape of the lightcurves, as seen in the X-rays and in
the optical, together with the fast variations of the flux observed, suggest
that the cooling time for the highest energy electrons may be shorter than the
light crossing time $R/c$. Moreover the existence of time lags between
lightcurves at different frequencies can be interpreted, in the frame of
homogeneous models, as due to the different cooling times of electrons of
different energy. To reproduce in detail the variability pattern at different
wavelengths we need to study the time dependent behavior of the emitting
particle distribution and to take into account of the different light travel
times of photons produced in different regions of the source. We apply the
model to PKS 2155-304 (1991 and 1994 campaigns).

Title:Particle Aggregation in a turbulent Keplerian flow,"
Abstract:  In the problem of planetary formation one seeks a mechanism to gather small
solid particles together into larger accumulations of solid matter. Here we
describe a scenario in which turbulence mediates this process by aggregating
particles into anticyclonic regions. If, as our simulations suggest,
anticyclonic vortices form as long-lived coherent structures, the process
becomes more powerful because such vortices trap particles effectively. Even if
the turbulence is decaying, following the upheaval that formed the disk, there
is enough time to make the dust distribution quite lumpy.

Title:Caustic Crossings in Quasar Light Curves?,"
Abstract:  Numerical simulations and theoretical studies of the gravitational
microlensing effect of a population of small bodies distributed along the line
of sight to a compact light source such as a quasar indicate that caustic
crossing effects will be present given a sufficiently large optical depth to
lensing. These events will produce characteristic patterns in the quasar light
curve. In this paper we use a large sample of quasar light curves to search for
features with the properties of caustic crossing events. Two good candidates
are presented which it is argued are not easily explained as intrinsic
variation of the uasars. The relation between these events and microlensing
featurees seen in multiple quasar systems is discussed, as well as the
implications for the dark matter problem of a population of microlensing
bodies.

Title:Gas-rich LSB Galaxies -- Progenitors of Blue Compact Dwarfs?,"
Abstract:  We analyze deep CCD images of nearby Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) galaxies in an
attempt to understand the nature of the progenitors which are hosting the
current burst of star formation. In particular, we ask whether BCDs are hosted
by normal or low-surface-brightness dI galaxies. We conclude that BCDs are in
fact hosted by gas-rich galaxies which populate the extreme
high-central-mass-density end of the dwarf galaxy distribution. Such galaxies
are predisposed to having numerous strong bursts of star formation in their
central regions. In this picture, BCDs can only occur in the minority of dwarf
galaxies, rather than being a common phase experienced by all gas-rich dwarfs.

Title:The broad-band power spectra of X-ray binaries,"
Abstract:  We analyzed the rapid aperiodic X-ray variability of different types of X-ray
binaries (black hole candidates, atoll sources, the recently discovered
millisecond X-ray pulsar, and Z sources) at their lowest inferred mass
accretion rates. At these accretion rates, the power spectra of all sources are
dominated by a strong band-limited noise component, which follows a power law
with an index roughly 1 at high frequencies and breaks at a frequency between
0.02 and 32 Hz below which the spectrum is relatively flat. Superimposed on
this, a broad bump (sometimes a quasi-periodic oscillation) is present with a
0.2-67 Hz centroid frequency that varies in good correlation with the frequency
of the break. The black hole candidates and the low-luminosity neutron star
systems (including the millisecond X-ray pulsar) have the same relation between
the frequency of the bump and the frequency of the break. These similar
characteristics strongly suggest that in all those different types of sources
the band-limited noise and the bump are produced by the same physical
mechanism. This mechanism cannot then depend on the presence or absence of
either a small magnetosphere or a solid surface, so that it is most likely
related to an instability in the flow in the accretion disk that modulates the
accretion rate.
The Z sources, which are more luminous than the other sources discussed here,
follow a similar, but slightly shifted correlation between the break frequency
and the frequency of the bump. The data suggest that the band-limited noise in
Z sources is more complex than that in the other sources.

Title:Non-axisymmetric relativistic Bondi-Hoyle accretion onto a Kerr black hole,"
Abstract:  In our program of studying numerically the so-called Bondi-Hoyle accretion in
the fully relativistic regime, we present here first results concerning the
evolution of matter accreting supersonically onto a rotating (Kerr) black hole.
These computations generalize previous results where the non-rotating
(Schwarzschild) case was extensively considered. We parametrize our initial
data by the asymptotic conditions for the fluid and explore the dependence of
the solution on the angular momentum of the black hole. Towards quantifying the
robustness of our numerical results, we use two different geometrical
foliations of the black hole spacetime, the standard form of the Kerr metric in
Boyer-Lindquist coordinates as well as its Kerr-Schild form, which is free of
coordinate singularities at the black hole horizon. We demonstrate some
important advantages of using such horizon adapted coordinate systems.
Our numerical study indicates that regardless of the value of the black hole
spin the final accretion pattern is always stable, leading to constant
accretion rates of mass and momentum. The flow is characterized by a strong
tail shock, which, unlike the Schwarzschild case, is increasingly wrapped
around the central black hole as the hole angular momentum increases. The
rotation induced asymmetry in the pressure field implies that besides the well
known drag, the black hole will experience also a lift normal to the flow
direction. This situation exhibits some analogies with the Magnus effect of
classical fluid dynamics.

Title:Nonlinear Alpha Effect in Dynamo Theory,"
Abstract:  We extend the standard two-scale theory of the turbulent dynamo coefficient
$\alpha$ to include the nonlinear back reaction of the mean field $\bar B$ on
the turbulence. We calculate the turbulent emf as a power series in $\bar B$,
assuming that the base state of the turbulence ($\bar B=0$) is isotropic, and,
for simplicity, that the magnetic diffusivity equals the kinematic viscosity.
The power series converges for all $\bar B$, and for the special case that the
spectrum of the turbulence is sharply peaked in $k$, our result is proportional
to a tabulated function of the magnetic Reynolds number $R_M$ and the ratio
$\beta$ of $\bar B$ (in velocity units) to the rms turbulent velocity $v_0$.
For $\beta\to 0$ (linear regime) we recover the results of Steenbeck et al.
(1966) as modified by Pouquet et al. (1976). For $R_M\gg 1$, the usual
astrophysical case, $\alpha$ starts to decrease at $\beta \sim 1$, dropping
like $\beta^{-2}$ as $\beta \to \infty$. Hence for large $R_M$, $\alpha$
saturates at $\bar B\sim v_0$, as estimated by Kraichnan (1979), rather than at
$\bar B\sim R^{-1/2}_Mv_0$, as inferred by Cattaneo and Hughes (1996) from
their numerical simulations at $R_M$=100. We plan to carry out simulations with
various values of $R_M$ to investigate the discrepency.

the stability criterion in completely wrong way leading to inappropriate

Title:The ROSAT Deep Survey IV. A distant lensing cluster of galaxies with a bright arc,"
Abstract:  An unusual double-lobed extended X-ray source (RX J105343+5735) is detected
in the ROSAT ultra-deep HRI image of the Lockman Hole. The angular size of the
source is 1.7 X 0.7 arcmin^2 and its X-ray flux is 2 X 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1.
R-band imaging from the Keck telescope revealed a marginal excess of galaxies
brighter than R=24.5, but Keck LRIS spectroscopy of 24 objects around the X-ray
centroid did not yield a significant number of concordant redshifts. The
brightest galaxy close to the centre of the eastern emission peak appears to be
a gravitationally lensed arc at z=2.570, suggesting that the X-ray object is
associated with the lens, most likely a cluster of galaxies. Based on a
comparison of lensing surface mass density, X-ray luminosity, morphology and
galaxy magnitudes with clusters of known distance, we argue that RX
J105343+5735 is a cluster at a redshift around 1. Future X-ray, ground-based
optical/NIR and high resolution HST observations of the system will be able to

Title:A 160 MeV Bounce Model of The Big Bang,"
Abstract:  To propel the farthest galaxies at 0.5c, the big bang required a core energy
of 160MeV. Its baryon-photon ratio becomes $\eta=87.6\Omega_Bh^2$ which is
comparable to a supernova. Accretion photons emitted during the prior
contraction supplied the CMBR planck spectrum. The finding of primordial 2^H
levels varying by an order of magnitude is evidence of large scale structure
during nuclesynthesis. Rotating black holes from the primordial shell were the
density fluctuations for galaxy formation. Sufficient baryonic matter was
recaptured during the expansion to increase the universe scale factor and allow
supernovae Ia to occur in a closed universe. A low energy bounce model with
zeroing of the stress-energy tensor can solve the hot big bang problems.

"Title:A Magnetically-Switched, Rotating Black Hole Model For the Production of Extragalactic Radio Jets and the Fanaroff and Riley Class Division","
Abstract:  A model is presented in which both Fanaroff and Riley class I and II
extragalactic jets are produced by magnetized accretion disk coronae in the
ergospheres of rotating black holes. While the jets are produced in the
accretion disk itself, the output power still is an increasing function of the
black hole angular momentum. For high enough spin, the black hole triggers the
magnetic switch, producing highly-relativistic, kinetic-energy-dominated jets
instead of Poynting-flux-dominated ones for lower spin. The coronal mass
densities needed to trigger the switch at the observed FR break power are quite
small ($\sim 10^{-15} g cm^{-3}$), implying that the source of the jet material
may be either a pair plasma or very tenuous electron-proton corona, not the
main accretion disk itself.
The model explains the differences in morphology and Mach number between FR I
and II sources and the observed trend for massive galaxies to undergo the FR
I/II transition at higher radio power. It also is consistent with the energy
content of extended radio lobes and explains why, because of black hole
spindown, the space density of FR II sources should evolve more rapidly than
that of FR I sources.
If the present model is correct, then the ensemble average speed of
parsec-scale jets in sources distinguished by their FR I morphology (not
luminosity) should be distinctly slower than that for sources with FR II
morphology. The model also suggests the existence of a population of
high-redshift, sub-mJy FR I and II radio sources associated with spiral or
pre-spiral galaxies that flared once when their black holes were formed but
were never again re-kindled by mergers.

Title:The Intrinsic Magnetic Fields of the Galactic Black Hole Candidates,"
Abstract:  Recent work has linked the quiescent luminosities and hard/soft spectral
state switches of neutron stars (NSs) to their spinning magnetic fields. It is
shown here that the quiescent luminosities and spectral switches of galactic
black hole candidates (BHCs) could be produced in the same way for spin rates
below 100 Hz and magnetic fields above 10^10 G. It is also shown that the
ultrasoft peaks and large flickering amplitudes of the BHCs would be expected
from the surfaces of massive NSs. None of the few spectral characteristics that
distinguish BHCs from low mass NSs have been explained in terms of event
horizons. Serious consideration of the possibility that they might simply be
massive NSs opens an avenue for proof of event horizons by negation, but
requires the use of a space-time metric that has no event horizon. The Yilmaz
exponential metric used here is shown to have an innermost marginally stable
orbit with radius, binding energy and Keplerian frequency that are within a few
percent of the same quantities for the Schwarzschild metric. A maximum NS mass
of ~10 solar mass is found for the Yilmaz metric. The two metrics essentially
differ only by the presence/absence of a surface for the BHCs, thus enabling
proof or disproof of the existence of an event horizon.

Title:Long-Term Scintillation Studies of Pulsars: I. Observations and Basic Results,"
Abstract:  We report long-term scintillation observations of 18 pulsars in the DM range
3-35 pc cm^{-3} carried out during 1993-1995 using the Ooty Radio Telescope at
327 MHz. These observations were made with the aim of studying refractive
effects in pulsar scintillation, and obtaining reliable estimates of
diffractive and refractive scintillation properties. Dynamic scintillation
spectra of pulsars were regularly monitored at 10-90 epochs spanning 100-1000
days. Significant changes are observed in the dynamic spectra over time scales
as short as a few days. Large-amplitude fluctuations are observed in quantities
such as decorrelation bandwidth, scintillation time scale, drift rate, and flux
density. Several pulsars show organized features such as drifting bands in a
highly pronounced manner. For some pulsars, gradual and systematic variations
are seen in the drift rate of patterns which undergo several sign reversals
during the observing time spans. Anomalous behaviour such as persistent drifts
lasting over many months are seen for PSRs B0834+06 & B1919+21. Four pulsars
were studied for 2-4 well separated observing sessions, each lasting over ~ 100
days. In some cases, significant variations are seen in the average
scintillation properties and/or flux densities between successive observing
sessions. From our data, we have been able to obtain more accurate and reliable
estimates of scintillation properties and flux densities than those from the
earlier observations, by averaging out the fluctuations due to refractive
scintillation effects. These measurements are used to derive parameters such as
the strength of scattering and scintillation speeds. The present measurements
are compared with earlier measurements and the long-term stability of
scintillation properties and flux densities is discussed.

polarimetry of this system over a 2 week period. From a power spectrum of the
circular polarimetry data we determine that the spin period of the white dwarf
and the binary orbital period which differ by 1.2%. RX J2115-5840 is thus the
fourth near synchronous polar and has the shortest spin-orbit beat period: 6.3
days. By folding the data on spin, beat and orbital periods we find evidence
that the accretion stream is directed towards opposite magnetic poles as the
stream precesses around the white dwarf on the spin-orbit beat period. The
phasing requires that the accretion flow must be directed onto the same
magnetic field line at all spin-orbit beat phases implying that at some phases
the flow must follow a path around the white dwarf before accreting. This is
difficult to reconcile with simple views of how the accretion stream attaches
onto the magnetic field of the white dwarf.

Title:The Imprint of Galaxy Formation on X-ray Clusters,"
Abstract:  It is widely believed that structure in the Universe evolves hierarchically,
as primordial density fluctuations, amplified by gravity, collapse and merge to
form progressively larger systems. The structure and evolution of X-ray
clusters, however, seems at odds with this hierarchical scenario for structure
formation. Poor clusters and groups, as well as most distant clusters detected
to date, are substantially fainter than expected from the tight relations
between luminosity, temperature and redshift predicted by these models. Here we
show that these discrepancies arise because, near the centre, the entropy of
the hot, diffuse intracluster medium (ICM) is higher tha$ achievable through
gravitational collapse, indicating substantial non-gravitational heating of the
ICM. We estimate this excess entropy for the first time, and argue that it
represents a relic of the energetic winds through which forming galaxies
polluted the ICM with metals. Energetically, this is onl$ possible if the ICM
is heated at modest redshift ($z \ltsim 2$) but prior to cluster collapse,
indicating that the formation of galaxies precedes that of clusters and that
most clusters have been assembled very recently.

Title:On the possibility that rotation causes latitudinal abundance variations in stars,"
Abstract:  The effect of rotation of a star on the distribution of chemical species in
radiative zones is discussed. Gravity darkening generates a large radiative
force on heavy element ions which is directed toward the equatorial plane.
Taking iron as an example, it is shown that this force may produce drift
velocities similar to, and larger than, the typical velocities of bulk motion
due to meridional circulation. This potentially allows large chemical abundance
inhomogeneities to build up across a meridian over the lifetime of the star --
particularly near the equatorial plane. This enhancement may be significantly
reduced if the mass loss of the star is strongly metallicity dependent, in
which case the mass-loss rate may be enhanced in the equatorial plane.

Title:Roles of Hyperons in Neutron Stars,"
Abstract:  We examine the roles the presence of hyperons in the cores of neutron stars
may play in determining global properties of these stars. The study is based on
estimates that hyperons appear in neutron star matter at about twice the
nuclear saturation density, and emphasis is placed on effects that can be
attributed to the general multi-species composition of the matter, hence being
only weakly dependent on the specific modeling of strong interactions. Our
analysis indicates that hyperon formation not only softens the equation of
state but also severely constrains its values at high densities.
Correspondingly, the valid range for the maximum neutron star mass is limited
to about 1.5-1.8 $M_\odot$, which is a much narrower range than available when
hyperon formation is ignored. Effects concerning neutron star radii and
rotational evolution are suggested, and we demonstrate that the effect of
hyperons on the equation of state allows a reconciliation of observed pulsar
glitches with a low neutron star maximum mass. We discuss the effects hyperons
may have on neutron star cooling rates, including recent results which indicate
that hyperons may also couple to a superfluid state in high density matter. We
compare nuclear matter to matter with hyperons and show that once hyperons
accumulate in neutron star matter they reduce the likelihood of a meson
condensate, but increase the susceptibility to baryon deconfinement, which
could result in a mixed baryon-quark matter phase.

Title:Long-Term Scintillation Studies of Pulsars: II. Refractive Effects and the Spectrum of Plasma Density Fluctuations,"
Abstract:  Refractive scintillation effects are powerful techniques for discriminating
between different models proposed for the electron density fluctuation spectrum
in the ISM. Data from our long-term scintillation study of 18 pulsars in the DM
range 3-35 pc cm^{-3} (Paper I) are used to investigate two important
observable effects of refractive scintillation: (i) modulations of DISS
observables and flux, and (ii) drifting bands. Our data provide simultaneous
measurements of decorrelation bandwidth, scintillation time scale, flux density
and drift slope of patterns. The observed modulations of the first 3 are
compared with the theoretical predictions, and constraints are placed on the
density spectral form. The measured modulation indices are larger than
predicted by a Kolmogorov form. Measurements of drift slopes and DISS
parameters are used to independently estimate the slope of the density
spectrum, which is found to be consistent with a Kolmogorov form for several
pulsars.The contradictory results from these 2 independent methods are not
reconcilable with the simple theoretical models. Our observations show
anomalous behaviour like persistent drifting bands for some pulsars.This can be
interpreted as an excess power in the low wavenumber range (~10^{-12} -
10^{-13} m^{-1}) compared to the Kolmogorov expectations or the existence of
localized density structures.The results from our observations and those from
the earlier studies are examined for understanding the overall nature of the
density spectrum.The emerging picture is a Kolmogorov-like form in the
wavenumber range ~10^{-6} m^{-1} to ~10^{-11} m^{-1}, which either steepens or
has a bump near ~ 10^{-12} - 10^{-13} m^{-1}. We also discuss possible

revised linear spin-down rate of $5.1271 \times 10^{-14} s s^{-1}$, slightly
greater than the previously derived value. The narrow pulse shape (FWHM = 10%
duty cycle) in the ROSAT band resembles those seen in both XTE and ASCA data (>
2 keV), but there is also marginal evidence for an interpulse. This ROSAT
detection enables us to locate the pulsar at R.A., Dec (J2000) =
$5^h37^m47^s.2, -69^\circ 10' 23''$. With its uncertainty $\sim 3''$, this
position coincides with the centroid of a compact X-ray source. But the pulsed
emission accounts for only about 10% of the source luminosity $\sim 2 \times
10^{36} ergs^{-1}$ in the 0.1-2 keV band. These results support our previous
suggestions: (1) The pulsar is moving at a high velocity ($\sim 10^3 km/s$);
(2) A bow shock, formed around the pulsar, is responsible for most of the X-ray
emission from the source; (3) A collimated outflow from the bow shock region
powers a pulsar wind nebula that accounts for an elongated non-thermal radio
and X-ray feature to the northwest of the pulsar.

Title:The energy spectrum observed by the AGASA experiment and the spatial distribution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays,"
Abstract:  Seven and a half years of continuous monitoring of giant air showers
triggered by ultra high-energy cosmic rays have been recently summarized by the
AGASA collaboration. The resulting energy spectrum indicates clearly that the
cosmic ray spectrum extends well beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK)
cut-off at $\sim 5 \times 10^{19}$ eV. Furthermore, despite the small number
statistics involved, some structure in the spectrum may be emerging. Using
numerical simulations, it is demonstrated in the present work that these
features are consistent with a spatial distribution of sources that follows the
distribution of luminous matter in the local Universe. Therefore, from this
point of view, there is no need for a second high-energy component of cosmic
rays dominating the spectrum beyond the GZK cut-off.

Abstract:  Recent ROSAT and ASCA X-ray observations as well as HST images have provided
new insights into the structure and evolution of the 30 Dor nebula. I review
hot gas properties of the nebula and discuss related physical processes. The

the parent giant molecular cloud of R136. The dynamic mixing between the two
gas phases is likely a key mass loading process of the hot gas, providing a
natural explanation of both temperature and density structure of the nebula.

Title:Long-Term Scintillation Studies of Pulsars: III. Testing Theoretical Models of Refractive Scintillation,"
Abstract:  Refractive interstellar scintillation (RISS) is thought to be the cause
behind a variety of phenomena seen at radio wavelengths in pulsars and compact
radio sources. Though there is substantial observational data to support
several consequences of it, the quantitative predictions from theories have not
been thoroughly tested. In this paper, data from our long-term scintillation
study of 18 pulsars are used to test the predictions. The fluctuations of
decorrelation bandwidth ($\nu_d$), scintillation time scale ($\tau_d$) and flux
density (F) are examined for their cross-correlations and compared with the
predictions. The theory predicts a strong correlation between $\nu_d$ and
$\tau_d$, and strong anti-correlations between $\nu_d$ and F, and $\tau_d$ and
F. For 5 pulsars, we see a reasonable agreement. There is considerable
difficulty in reconciling the results for the rest of the pulsars. Our analysis
shows the underlying noise sources can sometimes reduce the correlation, but
cannot cause an absence of correlation. It is also unlikely that the poor flux
correlations arise from a hitherto unrecognized intrinsic flux variations. For
PSR B0834+06, which shows anomalous behaviour of persistent drift slopes,
positive correlation is found between $\tau_d$ and the drift-corrected $\nu_d$.
Many pulsars show an anti-correlation between $\nu_d$ and the drift slope, and
this is in accordance with the simple models of RISS. The detections of
correlated variations of observables and a reasonable agreement between the
predicted and measured correlations for some pulsars confirm RISS as the
primary cause of the observed fluctuations. However, the complexity seen with
the detailed results suggests the necessity of more comprehensive theoretical
treatments for describing refractive fluctuations and their correlations.

Abstract:  We present imaging polarimetry of the extremely luminous, redshift 2.3 IRAS
source FSC10214+4724. The observations were obtained with HST's Faint Object
Camera in the F437M filter, which is free of strong emission lines. The 0.7
arcsec long arc is unresolved to 0.04 arcsec FWHM in the transverse direction,
and has an integrated polarization of 28 +/- 3 percent, in good agreement with
ground-based observations. The polarization position angle varies along the arc
by up to 35 deg. The overall position angle is 62 +/- 3 deg east of north. No
counterimage is detected to B = 27.5 mag ($3\sigma$), giving an observed arc to
counterimage flux ratio greater than 250, considerably greater than the flux
ratio of 100 measured previously in the I-band. This implies that the
configuration of the object in the source plane at the B-band is different from
that at I-band, and/or that the lensing galaxy is dusty.

Abstract:  The photometric errors of the external calibrator for the FIRAS instrument on
the COBE are smaller than the measurement errors on the cosmic microwave
background (CMBR) spectrum (typically 0.02 MJy/sr, 1 sigma), and smaller than
0.01% of the peak brightness of the CMBR. The calibrator is a re-entrant cone,
shaped like a trumpet mute, made of Eccosorb iron-loaded epoxy. It fills the
entire beam of the instrument and is the source of its accuracy. Its known
errors are caused by reflections, temperature gradients, and leakage through
the material and around the edge. Estimates and limits are given for all known
error sources. Improvements in understanding the temperature measurements of
the calibrator allow an improved CMBR temperature determination of 2.725 +/-

transients produce gamma-ray bursts over the hypothesis that they do not. We
then apply this method to a sample of 83 Type Ia supernovae and a sample of 20
Type Ib-Ic supernovae. We find overwhelming odds against the hypothesis that
all Type Ia supernovae produce gamma-ray bursts, whether at low redshift
($10^{9}:1$) or high-redshift ($10^{12}:1$), and very large odds ($6000:1$)
against the hypothesis that all Type Ib, Ib/c, and Ic supernovae produce
observable gamma-ray bursts. We find large odds ($34:1$) against the hypothesis
that a fraction of Type Ia supernovae produce observable gamma-ray bursts, and
moderate odds ($6:1$) against the hypothesis that a fraction of Type Ib-Ic
supernovae produce observable bursts. We have also re-analyzed both a corrected
version of the Wang & Wheeler sample of Type Ib-Ic SNe and our larger sample of
20 Type Ib-Ic SNe, using a generalization of their frequentist method. We find
no significant evidence in either case of a correlation between Type Ib-Ic SNe
and GRBs, consistent with the very strong evidence against such a correlation

Title:On the Extreme Ultraviolet Emission from Galaxy Clusters,"
Abstract:  An extremely soft X-ray excess throughout galaxy clusters has been claimed as
a new feature of these sytems, with important physical implications. We have
reexamined this feature in the five clusters for which it has been discussed,
using the most recent X-ray absorption cross sections, X-ray data processing
techniques, and a consistent set of HI data. For the Virgocluster, we find that
the spectrum can be fit with a single-temperature thermal plasma and with an
X-ray absorption column that is not significantly different than the Galactic
HI column. The result for Abell 1367, Abell 1656 (Coma), Abell 1795, and Abell
2199 is similar in that the difference betweenthe X-ray absorption column and
the Galactic HI column is less than 3-sigma for He/H = 0.09, and for He/H =
0.10 only one cluster location leads to a Galactic HI column more than 3-sigma
above the X-ray absorption column (Coma, with one location with a 3.6-sigma
difference). We conclude that there is no strong evidence for the extremely
soft X-ray excess in galaxy clusters.

"Title:Interstellar Turbulence, Cloud Formation and Pressure Balance","
Abstract:  We discuss HD and MHD compressible turbulence as a cloud-forming and
cloud-structuring mechanism in the ISM. Results from a numerical model of the
turbulent ISM at large scales suggest that the phase-like appearance of the
medium, the typical values of the densities and magnetic field strengths in the
intercloud medium, as well as Larson's velocity dispersion-size scaling
relation in clouds may be understood as consequences of the interstellar
turbulence. However, the density-size relation appears to only hold for the
densest simulated clouds, there existing a large population of small,
low-density clouds, which, on the other hand, are hardest to observe. We then
discuss several tests and implications of a fully dynamical picture of
interstellar clouds. The results imply that clouds are transient, constantly
being formed, distorted and disrupted by the turbulent velocity field, with a
fraction of these fluctuations undergoing gravitational collapse. Simulated
line profiles and estimated cloud lifetimes are consistent with observational
data. In this scenario, we suggest it is quite unlikely that quasi-hydrostatic
structures on any scale can form, and that the near pressure balance between
clouds and the intercloud medium is an incidental consequence of the density
field driven by the turbulence and in the presence of appropriate cooling,
rather than a driving or confining mechanism.

Title:Chemical Abundances of the Damped Lya Systems at z>1.5,"
Abstract:  We present chemical abundance measurements for 19 damped lya systems observed
with HIRES on the 10m W.M. Keck Telescope. Our principal goal is to investigate
the abundance patterns of the damped systems and thereby determine the
underlying physical processes which dominate their chemical evolution. We place
particular emphasis on gauging the relative importance of two complementary
effects often invoked to explain the damped lya abundances: (1) nucleosynthetic
enrichment from Type II supernovae and (2) an ISM-like dust depletion pattern.
Similar to the principal results of Lu et al. (1996), our observations lend
support both for dust depletion and Type II SN enrichment. Specifically, the
observed overabundance of Zn/Fe and underabundance of Ni/Fe relative to solar
abundances suggest significant dust depletion within the damped lya systems.
Meanwhile, the relative abundances of Al, Si, and Cr vs. Fe are consistent with
both dust depletion and Type II supernova enrichment. Our measurements of Ti/Fe
and the Mn/Fe measurements from Lu et al. (1996), however, cannot be explained
by dust depletion and indicate an underlying Type II SN pattern. Finally, the
observed values of [S/Fe] are inconsistent with the combined effects of dust
depletion and the nucleosynthetic yields expected for Type II supernovae. This
last result emphasizes the need for another physical process to explain the
damped lya abundance patterns.
We also examine the metallicity of the damped lya systems both with respect
to Zn/H and Fe/H. Our results confirm previous surveys by Pettini and
collaborators, i.e., [<Zn/H>] = -1.15 +/- 0.15 dex. [abridged]

Abstract:  We present millimetre photometry and submillimetre imaging of the central
core and two hotspots in the radio lobes of the galaxy Cygnus-A. For both
hotspots and the central core the synchrotron spectrum continues smoothly from
the radio to a frequency of 677 GHz. The spectral index of the hotspots is
constant over our frequ ency range, with a spectral index of about -1.0, which
is steeper than at lower frequencies and represents the emission from an aged
population of electrons. The core is significantly flatter, with a spectral
index of -0.6 +/- 0.1, suggestive of an injected spectrum with no ageing, but
some evidence for steepening exists at our highest observing frequency.
Although IRAS data suggest t he presence of dust in Cygnus-A, our 450 um data
show no evidence of cold dust, therefore the dust component must have a
temperature lying between 85 K and 37 K, respectively.

Title:Statistical lensing by galactic discs,"
Abstract:  The high-magnification gravitational lensing cross-section of a galaxy is
enhanced significantly if a baryonic disc is embedded in its dark matter halo.
We investigate the effects of a population of such disks on the probability of
detecting strongly lensed images of distant galaxies and quasars. The optical
depth to lensing is always more than doubled. The effects are particularly
significant at magnifications greater than about 50, for which the optical
depth typically increases by a factor greater than 5. If either the fraction of
discs or the typical disc-to-halo mass ratio increases with redshift, then the
optical depth is expected to be increased even further. Obscuration by dust in
the lensing disc is expected to counteract the associated enhanced
magnification bias for surveys in the optical waveband, but not in the radio
and millimetre/submillimetre wavebands. The presence of galactic discs should
hence lead to a significant increase in the number of lensed galaxies and
quasars detected in both radio- and millimetre/submillimetre-selected surveys.
An increase by a factor of about 3 is expected, enhancing the strong case for
millimetre/submillimetre-wave lens surveys using the next generation of
ground-based telescopes and the FIRST and Planck Surveyor space missions.

absorption, produced in late-type stars, is detected within the sample,
although at a weaker level than is typical for starburst galaxies. We conclude

Abstract:  Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS observations are presented of six brown dwarf
candidates in the Pleiades open cluster. One of them, namely CFHT-Pl-18, is
clearly resolved as a binary with an angular separation of 0"".33. The very low
density of contaminating background stars in our images and the photometry of
the components support that this system is a physical binary rather than a
chance projection. All the available photometric and spectroscopic data
indicate that the CFHT-Pl-18 system is likely a member of the Pleiades cluster,
but a final confirmation will have to wait until lithium can be detected.
Assuming cluster membership, we compare our NICMOS photometry with evolutionary
models, and find that the inclusion of the effects of dust grains is necessary
for fitting the data. We estimate that the masses of the components are about
0.045 Msol and 0.035 Msol. The binary system has a projected separation of 42

Title:Chemically consistent evolution of galaxies: galaxy models compared to DLA systems,"
Abstract:  We have extended our chemical and cosmological galaxy evolution model to
calculate the abundance evolution for altogether 16 different elements in
spiral galaxies in a chemically consistent way which is a considerable step
towards a more realistic galaxy modeling. Our models well reproduce observed
average HII region abundances in all spiral types. All observed element
abundances in DLA systems have been compiled. The conformity between observed
and calculated abundances over the redshift range from z=4.5 through z=0.4
indicates that DLA galaxies may well evolve into the full range of present- day
spiral galaxies from Sa through Sd.
Comparison of our chemically consistent models with models using only solar
metallicity input physics shows that differences in the redshift evolution are
small for some elements but large for others. For those elements with large
differences the chemically consistent models provide significant better
agreement with observed DLA abundances.
For typical spiral galaxies the star formation histories of our models
clearly bridge the gap between high redshift DLA systems and the nearby spiral
galaxy population. The slow redshift evolution of DLA abundances is understood
in terms of the long star formation timescales in galactic and proto-galactic
disks. Towards lower redshift z < 1.5 our models indicate that early type
spirals drop out of the DLA samples as their gas content falls below ~50%.
Implications for optical identification are discussed.

Abstract:  We present the first results on the identification and study of very distant
field galaxies in the core of cluster-lenses, using a selection criterium based
on both lens modelling and photometric redshifts. We concentrate on two
multiple-imaged sources at z=4.05 in the cluster A2390. The 2 objects presented
in this paper, namely H3 and H5, were identified through lens modelling as
multiple images of high-redshift sources at z>3.5. We confirm the excellent
agreement between this identification and both their photometric redshifts and
morphologies. Our CFHT/WHT program for a systematic redshift survey of arcs in
clusters has allowed to obtain a set of spectra on 3 different images at z~4:
the brightest image of H3, which redshift was already confirmed by Frye &
Broadhurst (1998), and the two brightest images of H5. The later is then
confirmed spectroscopically as a multiple image, giving a strong support to the
lens model. The main feature in each of these spectra is a strong emission
line, identified as Ly-alpha, leading to z=4.05 for both H3 and H5. The
spectrophotometric properties of these galaxies are studied, in particular the
degeneracy in the parameter-space defined by the SFR type, age, metallicity and
reddening. H3 and H5 are intrinsically bright and clumpy sources located ~100
kpc part on the source plane, with mean metallicities compatible with a
fraction of solar or even solar values. All these results seem to favour a
hierarchical merging scenario, where we are actually seeing a relatively
advanced step for these 2 z~4 objects, with stars forming locally and
efficiently from a preenriched gas.

Abstract:  We have made radio observations of 87 optically selected quasars at 5 GHz
with the VLA in order to measure the radio power for these objects and hence
determine how the fraction of radio-loud quasars varies with redshift and
optical luminosity. The sample has been selected from the recently completed
Edinburgh Quasar Survey and covers a redshift range of 0.3 < z < 1.5 and an
optical absolute magnitude range of -26.5 < M_{B} < -23.5 (h, q_{0} = 1/2). We
have also matched up other existing surveys with the FIRST and NVSS radio
catalogues and combined these data so that the optical luminosity-redshift
plane is now far better sampled than previously. We have fitted a model to the
probability of a quasar being radio-loud as a function of absolute magnitude
and redshift and from this model infer the radio-loud and radio-quiet optical
luminosity functions. The radio-loud optical luminosity function is featureless
and flatter than the radio-quiet one. It evolves at a marginally slower rate if
quasars evolve by density evolution, but the difference in the rate of
evolutions of the two different classes is much less than was previously
thought. We show, using Monte-Carlo simulations, that the observed difference
in the shape of the optical luminosity functions can be partly accounted for by
Doppler boosting of the optical continuum of the radio-loud quasars and explain
how this can be tested in the future.

velocity dispersion, luminosity functions, core radii and magnification bias
effects) and on the parameters of the galaxy distribution and luminosity
functions. In the process we derive new results on magnification biasing for

dispersions appropriate for use in lensing statistics. We argue that the
existing data do not disfavor a large cosmological constant. In fact, for a set
of reasonable parameter choices, using the results of 5 optical quasar lensing
surveys we find that a maximum likelihood analysis favors a value of $\om$ in
the range $ \approx 0.25$-0.55 in a flat universe. An open cosmology is not
favored by the same statistical analysis. Systematic uncertainties are likely
to be dominant, however, as these results are sensitive to uncertainties in our
understanding of galaxy luminosity functions, and dark matter velocity
dispersions, as well as the choice of lensing survey, and to a lesser extent
the existence of core radii. Further observational work will be required before
it is possible to definitively distinguish between cosmological models on the
basis of gravitational lensing statistics.

Title:Combining Undersampled Dithered Images,"
Abstract:  Undersampled images, such as those produced by the HST WFPC-2, misrepresent
fine-scale structure intrinsic to the astronomical sources being imaged.
Analyzing such images is difficult on scales close to their resolution limits
and may produce erroneous results. A set of ``dithered'' images of an
astronomical source generally contains more information about its structure
than any single undersampled image, however, and may permit reconstruction of a
``superimage'' with Nyquist sampling. I present a tutorial on a method of image
reconstruction that builds a superimage from a complex linear combination of
the Fourier transforms of a set of undersampled dithered images. This method
works by algebraically eliminating the high order satellites in the periodic
transforms of the aliased images. The reconstructed image is an exact
representation of the data-set with no loss of resolution at the Nyquist scale.
The algorithm is directly derived from the theoretical properties of aliased
images and involves no arbitrary parameters, requiring only that the dithers
are purely translational and constant in pixel-space over the domain of the
object of interest. I show examples of its application to WFC and PC images. I
argue for its use when the best recovery of point sources or morphological
information at the HST diffraction limit is of interest.

Title:Cloning Hubble Deep Fields I: A Model-Independent Measurement of Galaxy Evolution,"
Abstract:  We present a model-independent method of quantifying galaxy evolution in
high-resolution images, which we apply to the Hubble Deep Field (HDF). Our
procedure is to k-correct all pixels belonging to the images of a complete set
of bright galaxies and then to replicate each galaxy image to higher redshift
by the product of its space density, 1/V_{max}, and the cosmological volume.
The set of bright galaxies is itself selected from the HDF, because presently
the HDF provides the highest quality UV images of a redshift-complete sample of
galaxies (31 galaxies with I<21.9, \bar{z}=0.5, and for which V/V_{max} is
spread fairly). These galaxies are bright enough to permit accurate
pixel-by-pixel k-corrections into the restframe UV (\sim 2000 A). We match the
shot noise, spatial sampling and PSF smoothing of the HDF data, resulting in
entirely empirical and parameter-free ``no-evolution'' deep fields of galaxies
for direct comparison with the HDF. In addition, the overcounting rate and the
level of incompleteness can be accurately quantified by this procedure. We
obtain the following results. Faint HDF galaxies (I>24) are much smaller, more
numerous, and less regular than our ``no-evolution'' extrapolation, for any
interesting geometry. A higher proportion of HDF galaxies ``dropout'' in both U
and B, indicating that some galaxies were brighter at higher redshifts than our
``cloned'' z\sim0.5 population.

Title:Cloning Hubble Deep Fields II: Models for Evolution by Bright Galaxy Image Transformation,"
Abstract:  In a companion paper we outlined a methodology for generating parameter-free,
model-independent ``no-evolution'' fields of faint galaxy images, demonstrating
the need for significant evolution in the HDF at faint magnitudes. Here we
incorporate evolution into our procedure, by transforming the input bright
galaxy images with redshift, for comparison with the HDF at faint magnitudes.
Pure luminosity evolution is explored assuming that galaxy surface brightness
evolves uniformly, at a rate chosen to reproduce the I-band counts. This form
of evolution exacerbates the size discrepancy identified by our no-evolution
simulations, by increasing the area of a galaxy visible to a fixed isophote.
Reasonable dwarf-augmented models are unable to generate the count excess
invoking moderate rates of stellar evolution. A plausible fit to the counts and
sizes is provided by `mass-conserving' density-evolution, consistent with
small-scale hierarchical growth, where the product of disk area and space
density is conserved with redshift. Here the increased surface brightness
generated by stellar evolution is accomodated by the reduced average galaxy
size, for a wide range of geometries. These models are useful for assessing the
limitations of the HDF images, by calculating their rates of incompleteness and
the degree of over-counting. Finally we demonstrate the potential for
improvement in quantifying evolution at fainter magnitudes using the HST
Advanced Camera, with its superior UV and optical performance.

Title:Collapse of a Molecular Cloud Core to Stellar Densities: The First Three-Dimensional Calculations,"
Abstract:  We present results from the first three-dimensional calculations ever to
follow the collapse of a molecular cloud core (~ 10^{-18} g cm^{-3}) to stellar
densities (> 0.01 g cm^{-3}). The calculations resolve structures over 7 orders
of magnitude in spatial extent (~ 5000 AU - 0.1 R_\odot), and over 17 orders of
magnitude in density contrast. With these calculations, we consider whether
fragmentation to form a close binary stellar system can occur during the second
collapse phase. We find that, if the quasistatic core that forms before the
second collapse phase is dynamically unstable to the growth of non-axisymmetric
perturbations, the angular momentum extracted from the central regions of the
core, via gravitational torques, is sufficient to prevent fragmentation and the
formation of a close binary during the subsequent second collapse.

Title:BeppoSAX Observations of the BL Lac Object Mkn 501 in an Intermediate State,"
Abstract:  The BL Lac object Mkn 501 was observed with the BeppoSAX satellite at three
epochs in April-May 1998, simultaneously with the Whipple and HEGRA Cherenkov
telescopes. The X-ray spectrum is well detected up to 70 keV and it exhibits,
at all epochs, a continuous curvature, which is here modeled with three
power-laws of increasingly steeper index at larger energies. In the nu*f_nu
representation the spectrum exhibits a peak at ~20 keV, which is interpreted as
the maximum of the synchrotron emission. This implies that the synchrotron peak
energy has lowered by an order of magnitude with respect to the powerful X-ray
outburst observed in April 1997. The simultaneous TeV flux was comparable to
the lowest levels observed for Mkn 501, possibly suggesting that the peak of
the inverse Compton radiation had also shifted toward lower energies.

Abstract:  We present a large sample of high-precision, coherently-dedispersed
polarization profiles of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at frequencies between 410

Our observations support previous suggestions that the pulse shapes and
polarimetry of MSPs are more complex than those of their slower relatives. An

for young pulsars are of only limited use when applied to millisecond pulsars.

Title:On the Radio-to-X-ray light curves of SN 1998bw and GRB 980425,"
Abstract:  We calculate radio-to-X-ray light curves for afterglows caused by non-thermal
emission from a highly relativistic blast wave, which is inferred from the
gamma-ray flux detected in GRB 980425 and from the very bright radio emission
detected in SN 1998bw. We find that the observed gamma-ray and radio light
curves are roughly reproduced by the synchrotron emission from a relativistic
fireball. The optical flux predicted for the non-thermal emission is well below
that of the thermal emission observed for SN 1998bw so that it will not be seen
at least for a few years. The model predicts the X-ray flux just above the
detection limit of BeppoSAX for the epoch when it was pointed to the field of
GRB980425. Therefore, the nondetection of X-ray and optical afterglows is
consistent with the model. The models presented here are consistent with the
physical association between SN 1998bw and GRB980425, and lend further support
to the idea that this object might correspond to an event similar to the
``hypernova'' or ``collapsar'' -- events in which the collapse of a massive
star forms a rotating black hole surrounded by a disk of the remnant stellar
mantle.

Title:Analytic Relations between the Observed Gravitational Microlensing Parameters With and Without the Effect of Blending,"
Abstract:  When a microlensing light curve is contaminated by blended light from
unresolved stars near the line of sight to the lensed star, the light curve
shape and corresponding parameterization for the event will differ from the
values expected when the event is not affected by blending. As a result,
blending makes it difficult to identify the major lens population and to
estimate the amount of lensing matter. In order to estimate the effect of
blending on the result of lensing experiments, it is, therefore, essential to
know how the observed lensing parameters change depending on the fraction of
blended light. Previously, the changed lensing parameters were obtained with a
statistical method that not only required a large amount of computation time
but also was prone to uncertainty. In this paper, we derive analytic relations
between the lensing parameters with and without the effect of blending. By
using these relations, we investigate the dependence of the observed lensing
parameters on the amount of blended light, the impact parameter, and the
threshold amplification for event detection.

Title:Gamma-ray burst afterglows and evolution of postburst fireballs with energy injection from strongly magnetic millisecond pulsars,"
Abstract:  Millisecond pulsars with strong magnetic fields may be formed through several
processes, e.g. accretion-induced collapse of magnetized white dwarfs, merger
of two neutron stars. During the birth of such a pulsar, an initial fireball
available for a gamma-ray burst (GRB) may occur. We here study evolution of a
postburst relativistic fireball with energy injection from the pulsar through
magnetic dipole radiation, and find that the magnitude of the optical afterglow
from this fireball first decreases with time, subsequently flattens, and
finally declines again. This may provide a natural explanation for the behavior
of the lightcurve of the afterglow of GRB970228 if this burst resulted from the
birth of a strongly magnetic millisecond pulsar.

Title:Gravitational Lensing of Distant Supernovae in Cold Dark Matter Universes,"
Abstract:  Ongoing searches for supernovae (SNe) at cosmological distances have recently
started to provide large numbers of events with measured redshifts and apparent
brightnesses. Compared to quasars or galaxies, Type Ia SNe represent a
population of sources with well-known intrinsic properties, and could be used
to detect gravitational lensing even in the absence of multiple or highly
distorted images. We investigate the lensing effect of background SNe due to
mass condensations in three popular cold dark matter cosmologies (LambdaCDM,
OCDM, SCDM), and compute lensing frequencies, rates of SN explosions, and
distributions of arrival time differences and image separations. If dark halos
approximate singular isothermal spheres on galaxy scales and NFW profiles on
group/cluster scales, and are distributed in mass according to the
Press-Schechter theory, then about one every 12 SNe at z~1 will be magnified by
Delta m>0.1 mag (SCDM). The detection rate of SN Ia with magnification Delta
m>0.3 is estimated to be of order a few events per year per square degree at
maximum B-light and I<25, a hundred time smaller than the total rate expected
at these magnitude levels. In the field, events magnified by more than 0.75 mag
are 7 times less frequent: about one fifth of them gives rise to observable
multiple images. Because of the flat K-correction and wide luminosity function,
Type II SNe dominate the number counts at I>25 and have the largest fraction of
lensed objects. The optimal survey sensitivity for Type Ia's magnified by Delta
m>0.75 mag is I=23. Magnification bias increases their incidence by a factor of
50 in samples with I<22, dropping to a factor of 3.5 at 24 mag. At faint
magnitudes the enhancement is larger for SN II.

Abstract:  An unexpected characteristic of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) is
that a significant number are massive and possess substantial amounts of atomic
gas. We present preliminary results of an ongoing program to obtain BVRIJHK
imaging, along with some nuclear spectroscopy, of a well-defined sample of
LSBGs which are gas-rich and of similar size to giant, high surface brightness
spiral galaxies (HSBGs). These LSBGs span the entire range of Hubble disk
morphologies. While their disks are bluer, on average, than comparable HSBGs,
the optical morphology of massive LSBGs indicates that many of these systems
have undergone previous star formation episodes. They typically have long disk
scale lengths, and range from $M_B = -16 to -22 (H_0 = 75 km/s Mpc^{-1})$.
About half of the LSBGs with bulges show evidence of nuclear activity, and
$\sim 30%$ have appear to be barred. These massive, gas-rich LSBGs apparently
have varied, and often complex, evolutionary histories.

Title:RXTE Observation of Cygnus X--1: III. Implications for Compton Corona and ADAF Models,"
Abstract:  We have recently shown that a `sphere+disk' geometry Compton corona model
provides a good description of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations
of the hard/low state of Cygnus X--1. Separately, we have analyzed the temporal
data provided by RXTE. In this paper we consider the implications of this
timing analysis for our best-fit `sphere+disk' Comptonization models. We focus
our attention on the observed Fourier frequency-dependent time delays between
hard and soft photons. We consider whether the observed time delays are:
created in the disk but are merely reprocessed by the corona; created by
differences between the hard and soft photon diffusion times in coronae with
extremely large radii; or are due to `propagation' of disturbances through the
corona. We find that the time delays are most likely created directly within
the corona; however, it is currently uncertain which specific model is the most
likely explanation. Models that posit a large coronal radius [or equivalently,
a large Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) region] do not fully address
all the details of the observed spectrum. The Compton corona models that do
address the full spectrum do not contain dynamical information. We show,
however, that simple phenomenological propagation models for the observed time
delays for these latter models imply extremely slow characteristic propagation
speeds within the coronal region.

5500 km s^{-1} emission lines of H\alpha, [O I] 6300,6364 A, and [O II]

Title:ASCA observations of deep ROSAT fields IV.IR and hard X-ray observations of an obscured high-redshift QSO,"
Abstract:  We use UKIRT and ASCA observations to determine the nature of a high redshift
(z=2.35) narrow-line AGN, previously discovered by Almaini et al. (1995). The
UKIRT observations show a broad Halpha line while no Hbeta line is detected.
This together with the red colour (B-K=5.4) suggest that our object is a
moderately obscured QSO (Av>3), in optical wavelengths. The ASCA data suggest a
hard spectrum, probably due to a large obscuring column, with a photon index of
1.93 (+0.62, -0.46), NH~10^23. The combined ASCA and ROSAT data again suggest a
heavily obscured spectrum (NH~10^23 or Av~100). In this picture, the ROSAT soft
X-ray emission may arise from electron scattering, in a similar fashion to
local Seyfert 1.9. Then, there is a large discrepancy between the moderate
reddening witnessed by the IR and the large X-ray absorbing column. This could
be possibly explained on the basis of e.g. high gas metallicities or assuming
that the X-ray absorbing column is inside the dust sublimation radius. An
alternative explanation can be obtained when we allow for variability between
the ROSAT and ASCA observations. Then the best fit spectrum is still flat, 1.35
(+0.16, -0.14), but with low intrinsic absorption in better agreement with the
IR data, while the ROSAT normalization is a factor of two below the ASCA
normalization. This object may be one of the bright examples of a type-II QSO
population at high redshift, previously undetected in optical surveys. The hard
X-ray spectrum of this object suggests that such a population could make a
substantial contribution to the X-ray background.

Abstract:  We report ASCA GIS and SIS observations of the nearby (D = 11.6 Mpc), nearly
edge-on, starburst galaxy NGC 2146. These X-ray spectral data complement ROSAT
PSPC and HRI imaging discussed by Armus et al., 1995. The broad band (0.6-9
keV) X-ray spectrum of NGC 2146 is best described by a two component model: the
soft X-ray emission with a Raymond-Smith thermal plasma model having a
temperature of kT $\sim 0.8$ keV; the hard X-ray emission with a thermal plasma
model having kT $\sim 8$ keV or a power-law model having a photon index of
$\sim 1.7$. We do not find compelling evidence of substantial excess absorption
above the Galactic value. The soft (hard) thermal component provides about 30%
(70%) of the total luminosity in the 0.5 - 2.0 keV energy band, while in the
2-10 keV energy range only the hard component plays a major role. The spectral
results allow us to set tighter constraints on the starburst-driven superwind
model, which we show can satisfactorily account for the luminosity, mass, and
energy content represented by the soft X-ray spectral component. We estimate
that the mass outflow rate ($\sim$ 9 M$_{\odot}$ per year) is about an order of
magnitude greater than the predicted rate at which supernovae and stellar winds
return mass into the interstellar medium and, therefore, argue that the flow is
strongly ""mass-loaded"" with material in and around the starburst. The estimated
outflow velocity of the hot gas is close to the escape velocity from the
galaxy, so the fate of the gas is not clear. We suggest that the hard X-ray
spectral component is due to the combined emission of X-ray binaries and/or
young supernovae remnants associated with the starburst.

Abstract:  We report observations at mid-infrared and sub-millimeter wavelengths of

closest radio loud Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) to Earth. The dust emission
from the deep interior of CenA reveals a bisymmetric structure with a diameter
of 5' (5 kpc), centred at the AGN. This structure is remarkably similar to that
of a barred spiral galaxy, with the bar lying in a plane that is tilted ~18
degrees from the line of sight. The true nature of the distribution of dust in
the inner regions of CenA is noticeably displaced from the more chaotic and
widespread optical obscuration. The barred spiral is a quasi-stable structure
formed at the center of the giant elliptical from the tidal debris of a
gas-rich object(s) accreted in the past 10^9 years. The total size and mass of
interstellar gas in the barred spiral at the center of CenA is comparable to
the small Local Group spiral galaxy Messier 33. The observation of this
remarkable structure opens the more general question on whether the dusty hosts
of giant radio galaxies like CenA, are ""symbiotic"" galaxies composed of a
barred spiral inside an elliptical, where the bar serves to funnel gas toward
the AGN.

Abstract:  In this paper we study the very early phases of the evolution of our Galaxy
by means of a chemical evolution model which reproduces most of the
observational constraints in the solar vicinity and in the disk. We have
restricted our analysis to the solar neighborhood and present the predicted
abundances of several elements (C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe) over an extended
range of metallicities $[Fe/H] = -4.0$ to $[Fe/H] = 0.0$ compared to previous
models. We adopted the most recent yield calculations for massive stars taken
from different authors (Woosley & Weaver 1995 and Thielemann et al. 1996) and
compared the results with a very large sample of data, one of the largest ever
used to this purpose. These data have been analysed with a new and powerful
statistical method which allows us to quantify the observational spread in
measured elemental abundances and obtain a more meaningful comparison with the
predictions from our chemical evolution model. Our analysis shows that the
``plateau'' observed for the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios at low metallicities ($-3.0<
[Fe/H] <-1.0$) is not perfectly constant but it shows a slope, especially for
oxygen. This slope is very well reproduced by our model with both sets of
yields. This is not surprising since realistic chemical evolution models,
taking into account in detail stellar lifetimes, never predicted a completely
flat plateau. This is due either to the fact that massive stars of different
mass produce a slightly different O/Fe ratio or to the often forgotten fact
that supernovae of type Ia, originating from white dwarfs, start appearing
already at a galactic age of 30 million years and reach their maximum at 1 Gyr.

Title:Cosmological Insights from Supernovae,"
Abstract:  While low-z Type Ia supernovae are used to measure the present rate of
expansion of the Universe, high-z Type Ia measure its variation due to the
cosmic matter-energy content. Results from those determinations imply a low
matter density Universe with a non-zero cosmological constant (vacuum-energy
component). The expansion rate of the Universe accelerates, according to these
determinations. The validity of the Type Ia supernova approach for this
cosmological research is addressed. An account is given of additional prospects
to further investigate through supernovae what the Universe is made of. Those
attempts range from constraining the large scale dark matter distribution to
further test and interpret the presence of a vacuum energy component.

Title:Severe New Limits on the Host Galaxies of Gamma Ray Bursts,"
Abstract:  The nature of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) remains a complete mystery, despite the
recent breakthrough discovery of low energy counterparts, although it is now
generally believed that at least most GRBs are at cosmological distances.
Virtually all proposed cosmological models require bursters to reside in
ordinary galaxies. This can be tested by looking inside the smallest GRB error
boxes to see if ordinary galaxies appear at the expected brightness levels.
This letter reports on an analysis of the contents of 26 of the smallest
regions, many from the brightest bursts. These events will have $z < 0.4$ and
small uncertainties about luminosity functions, K corrections and galaxy
evolutions; whereas the recent events with optical transients are much fainter
and hence have high redshifts and grave difficulties in interpretation. This
analysis strongly rejects the many models with peak luminosities of $10^{57}
photons \cdot s^{-1}$ as deduced from the $LogN-LogP$ curve with no evolution.
Indeed, the lower limit on acceptable luminosities is $6 \times 10^{58} photons
\cdot s^{-1}$. The only possible solution is to either place GRBs at
unexpectedly large distances (with $z > 5.9$ for the faint BATSE bursts) or to
require bursters to be far outside any normal host galaxy.

Title:3D numerical cosmological radiative transfer in an inhomogeneous medium,"
Abstract:  A numerical scheme is proposed for the solution of the three-dimensional
radiative transfer equation with variable optical depth. We show that
time-dependent ray tracing is an attractive choice for simulations of
astrophysical ionization fronts, particularly when one is interested in
covering a wide range of optical depths within a 3D clumpy medium. Our approach
combines the explicit advection of radiation variables with the implicit
solution of local rate equations given the radiation field at each point. Our
scheme is well suited to the solution of problems for which line transfer is
not important, and could, in principle, be extended to those situations also.
This scheme allows us to calculate the propagation of supersonic ionization
fronts into an inhomogeneous medium. The approach can be easily implemented on
a single workstation and also should be fully parallelizable.

Title:On the Cosmological Evolution of the Luminosity Function and the Accretion Rate of Quasars,"
Abstract:  We consider a class of models for the redshift evolution (between $0\lsim z
\lsim 4$) of the observed optical and X-ray quasar luminosity functions (LFs),
with the following assumptions: (i) the mass-function of dark matter halos
follows the Press-Schechter theory, (ii) the black hole (BH) mass scales
linearly with the halo mass, (iii) quasars have a constant universal lifetime,
and (iv) a thin accretion disk provides the optical luminosity of quasars,
while the X-ray/optical flux ratio is calibrated from a sample of observed
quasars. The mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ onto quasar BHs is a free parameter
of the models, that we constrain using the observed LFs. The accretion rate
$\dot M$ inferred from either the optical or X-ray data under these assumptions
generally decreases as a function of cosmic time from $z \simeq 4$ to $z \simeq
0$. We find that a comparable accretion rate is inferred from the X-ray and
optical LF only if the X-ray/optical flux ratio decreases with BH mass. Near
$z\simeq 0$, $\dot M$ drops to substantially sub-Eddington values at which
advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) exist. Such a decline of $\dot M$,
possibly followed by a transition to radiatively inefficient ADAFs, could
explain both the absence of bright quasars in the local universe and the
faintness of accreting BHs at the centers of nearby galaxies. We argue that a
decline of the accretion rate of the quasar population is indeed expected in
cosmological structure formation models.

Title:Velocity Field Statistics in Star-Forming Regions. I. Centroid Velocity Observations,"
Abstract:  The probability density functions (pdfs) of molecular line centroid velocity
fluctuations and fluctuation differences at different spatial lags are
estimated for several nearby molecular clouds with active internal star
formation. The data consist of over 75,000 $^{13}$CO line profiles divided
among twelve spatially and/or kinematically distinct regions. Although three
regions (all in Mon R2) appear nearly Gaussian, the others show strong evidence
for non-Gaussian, often nearly exponential, centroid velocity pdfs, possibly
with power law contributions in the far tails. Evidence for nearly exponential
centroid pdfs in the neutral HI component of the ISM is also presented, based
on older optical and radio observations. These results are in contrast to pdfs
found in isotropic incompressible turbulence experiments and simulations.
Furthermore, no evidence is found for the scaling of difference pdf kurtosis
with Reynolds number which is seen in incompressible turbulence, and the
spatial distribution of high-amplitude velocity differences shows little
indication of the filamentary appearance predicted by decay simulations
dominated by vortical interactions. The variation with lag of the difference
pdf moments is presented as a constraint on future simulations.

Title:Hydrodynamic Simulations of Counterrotating Accretion Disks,"
Abstract:  Hydrodynamic simulations have been used to study accretion disks consisting
of counterrotating components with an intervening shear layer(s).
Configurations of this type can arise from the accretion of newly supplied
counterrotating matter onto an existing corotating disk. The grid-dependent
numerical viscosity of our hydro code is used to simulate the influence of a
turbulent viscosity of the disk. Firstly, we consider the case where the gas
well above the disk midplane rotates with angular rate +\Omega(r) and that well
below has the same properties but rotates with rate -\Omega(r). We find that
there is angular momentum annihilation in a narrow equatorial boundary layer in
which matter accretes supersonically with a velocity which approaches the
free-fall velocity and the average accretion speed of the disk can be
enormously larger than that for a conventional \alpha-disk rotating in one
direction. Secondly, we consider the case of a corotating accretion disk for
r<r_t and a counterrotating disk for r>r_t. In this case we observed, that
matter from the annihilation layer lost its stability and propagated inward
pushing matter of inner regions of the disk to accrete. Thirdly, we
investigated the case where counterrotating matter inflowing from large radial
distances encounters an existing corotating disk. Friction between the
inflowing matter and the existing disk is found to lead to fast boundary layer
accretion along the disk surfaces and to enhanced accretion in the main disk.
These models are pertinent to the formation of counterrotating disks in
galaxies and possibly in Active Galactic Nuclei and in X-ray pulsars in binary
systems.

from the behaviour of density perturbations in dustlike matter component as a

Title:Discovery of a Nearby Low-Surface-Brightness Spiral Galaxy,"
Abstract:  During the course of a search for compact, isolated gas clouds moving with
anomalous velocities in or near our own Galaxy (Braun and Burton 1998 A&A, in
press), we have discovered, in the data of the Leiden/Dwingeloo survey
(Hartmann and Burton 1997, Atlas of Galactic Neutral Hydrogen, CUP) of Galactic
hydrogen, the HI signature of a large galaxy, moving at a recession velocity of
282 km/s, with respect to our Galaxy. Deep multicolor and spectroscopic optical
observations show the presence of star formation in scattered HII regions;
radio HI synthesis interferometry confirms that the galaxy is rich in HI and
has the rotation signature of a spiral galaxy; a submillimeter observation
failed to detect the CO molecule. The radio and optical evidence combined
suggest its classification as a low-surface-brightness spiral galaxy. It is
located in close spatial and kinematic proximity to the galaxy NGC 6946. The
newly-discovered galaxy, which we call Cepheus 1, is at a distance of about 6
Mpc. It is probably to be numbered amongst the nearest few LSB spirals.

"Title:The Kinematic and Spatial Deployment of Compact, Isolated High-Velocity Clouds","
Abstract:  We have identified a class of high-velocity clouds which are compact and
apparently isolated. The clouds are compact in that they have angular sizes
less than 2 degrees FWHM. They are isolated in that they are separated from
neighboring emission by expanses where no emission is seen to the detection
limit of the available data. Candidates for inclusion in this class were
extracted from the Leiden/Dwingeloo HI survey of Hartmann & Burton and from the
Wakker & van Woerden catalogue of high-velocity clouds. The candidates were
subject to independent confirmation using either the 25-meter telescope in
Dwingeloo or the 140-foot telescope in Green Bank. We argue that the resulting
list, even if incomplete, is sufficiently representative of the ensemble of
compact, isolated HVCs - CHVCs - that the characteristics of their disposition
on the sky, and of their kinematics, are revealing of some physical aspects of
the class. The CHVCs are in fact distributed quite uniformly across the sky. A
global search for the reference frame which minimizes the velocity dispersion
of the ensemble returns the Local Group Standard of Rest with high confidence.
The CHVCs are not stationary with respect to this reference frame but have a
mean infall velocity of 100 km/s. These properties are strongly suggestive of a
population which has as yet had little interaction with the more massive Local
Group members. At a typical distance of about 1 Mpc these objects would have
sizes of about 15 kpc and gas masses, M_HI, of a few times 10^7 M_Sun,
corresponding to those of (sub-)dwarf galaxies. (abridged)

Abstract:  We report the detection of a peculiar molecular cloud, CO 0.02-0.02, lying
about 5' Galactic-east from the center of the Galaxy. (12)CO images taken with
NRO 45 m telescope showed that it is relatively compact (about 3x4 pc^2) as
well as having a very large velocity width (DV>=100 km s(-1)). The cloud has a
virial mass about one order of magnitude larger than the LTE mass, 9E4
M(solar), indicating the cloud is apparently gravitationally unbound. New
observations with the JCMT 15 m and the NRO 45 m telescope show that CO
0.02-0.02 is very bright in the CO J=3-2, and in the HCN and HCO+ J=1-0 lines.
It appears that the environment may have an unusually high density and
temperature, which may be related to the very broad CO line-width. We propose
that CO 0.02-0.02 may have been accelerated, heated and compressed in a series
of supernovae shocks which have occurred within the last (3-5)E4$ years.

Title:Anomalous Gravitational Effects in the Universe,"
Abstract:  Based on previously published alternative reflections on gravitation,
additional conclusions concerning anomalous gravitational effects in the
universe are derived. For systems with spherical mass distribution and high
central density of the luminous matter, abnormal increases in the gravitational
potential towards the centers of these systems are derived. These anomalous
increases are calculated on the basis of the amount and distribution of the
observed luminous matter. For spiral galaxies, the calculation yields the
astonishing result that the anomalous part of the gravitational potential is
not produced by the large mass of the spiral system but by the small mass of
the central bulge. A noticeable anomalous increase can only be expected close
to the center, e.g. in the innermost region with a diameter on the order of
only 1 pc in a bulge with a radius of 500 pc. Experimental observations are
cited reporting such anomalous gravitational effects in the four spherical
systems considered: globular star clusters, the bulges of spiral galaxies,
elliptical galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. Conventionally, on the basis of
Newtonian Mechanics and the amount of luminous matter, these effects are
unexpected. They are most commonly explained by assuming the existence of
appropriate large black holes or a sufficient amount of dark matter.

Abstract:  RXJ 0501.7-0359 is a new V ~ 17 mag eclipsing polar discovered during the
ROSAT all-sky survey (RASS). Extensive follow-up observations at X-ray (pointed
ROSAT PSPC and HRI observations) and optical (time-resolved photometry and
spectroscopy) wavelengths were obtained which allowed us to determine a very
precise orbital period and to provide constraints for the masses of the binary
components and the orbital inclination. With an orbital period of P ~ 171 min
the system is placed at the upper end of the period gap. From the radial
velocity amplitude of the secondary and the duration of the primary eclipse we
obtain a mass ratio q = M_2/M_1 = 0.83 +/- 0.15 and an inclination i = 75 degr
+/- 3 degr for the system. This yields a white dwarf mass M_1 =
0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.07} M_sun. Cyclotron humps might be present in some of our

galaxies NGC 891 (D=9.5 Mpc) and NGC 4013 (D=17 Mpc) acquired with the WIYN

interstellar material far above the midplanes of both galaxies (0.5 < |z| < 2
kpc) as discussed previously by Howk & Savage (1997). The dusty high-z clouds,
visible in absorption against the background stellar light of the galaxies,
have widths 50-100 pc and lengths 100-400 pc. An analysis of their absorbing
properties suggests they have A_V > 0.5 - 2.0. If Milky Way gas-to-dust
relationships are appropriate, then these structures have gaseous column
densities N_H > 10(21) cm(-2), with very large masses (>10(5) - 10(6) solar
masses) and gravitational potential energies (> 10(51) - 10(52) ergs relative
to z=0). The estimated column densities suggest molecular gas may be present,
and with the estimated masses allows for the possibility of star formation in
these dusty clouds. Recent star formation is the likely cause of the discrete H
II regions, in some cases associated with relatively blue continuum sources,
observed at heights 0.6 < |z| < 0.8 kpc above the disks of these galaxies. The
presence of early-type stars at high-z in these galaxies may be related to the

Title:The Detection of The Gravitational Lensing of Supernovae,"
Abstract:  The weak gravitational lensing of high redshift type Ia supernovae has the
potential of probing the structure of matter on galaxy halo scales. This is
complementary to the weak lensing of galaxies which probes structure of larger
scales. There are already several organized searches for these supernovae being
carried out for the purposes of cosmological parameter estimation. A method is
proposed for extracting from future supernovae data information on lensing and
the structures responsible. This method utilizes the correlations between SN
luminosities and foreground galaxies. Simulations of the lensing and
uncertainties will be presented. It is found that with a hundred supernovae or
more at $z\simgt 1$ or larger, significant measurements of the mass, shape and
extent of dark matter halos could be made if they contain a significant

Title:Superfluid Friction and Late-time Thermal Evolution of Neutron Stars,"
Abstract:  The recent temperature measurements of the two older isolated neutron stars
PSR 1929+10 and PSR 0950+08 (ages of $3\times 10^6$ and $2\times 10^7$ yr,
respectively) indicate that these objects are heated. A promising candidate
heat source is friction between the neutron star crust and the superfluid it is
thought to contain. We study the effects of superfluid friction on the
long-term thermal and rotational evolution of a neutron star. Differential
rotation velocities between the superfluid and the crust (averaged over the
inner crust moment of inertia) of $\bar\omega\sim 0.6$ rad s$^{-1}$ for PSR
1929+10 and $\sim 0.02$ rad s$^{-1}$ for PSR 0950+08 would account for their
observed temperatures. These differential velocities could be sustained by
pinning of superfluid vortices to the inner crust lattice with strengths of
$\sim$ 1 MeV per nucleus. Pinned vortices can creep outward through thermal
fluctuations or quantum tunneling. For thermally-activated creep, the coupling
between the superfluid and crust is highly sensitive to temperature. If pinning
maintains large differential rotation ($\sim 10$ rad s$^{-1}$), a feedback
instability could occur in stars younger than $\sim 10^5$ yr causing
oscillations of the temperature and spin-down rate over a period of $\sim 0.3
t_{\rm age}$. For stars older than $\sim 10^6$ yr, however, vortex creep occurs
through quantum tunneling, and the creep velocity is too insensitive to
temperature for a thermal-rotational instability to occur. These older stars
could be heated through a steady process of superfluid friction.

Title:Dust in the Ionized Medium of the Galaxy: GHRS Measurements of Al III and S III,"
Abstract:  We present interstellar absorption line measurements of the ions S III and Al
III towards six stars using archival Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph data.
The ions Al III and S III trace heavily depleted and non-depleted elements,
respectively, in ionized gas. We use the photoionization code CLOUDY to derive
the ionization correction relating N(Al III)/N(S III) to the gas-phase
abundance [Al/S]_i in the ionized gas. For spectral types considered here, the
corrections are small and independent of the assumed ionization parameter.
Using the results of these photoionization models, we find [Al/S]_i = -1.0 in
the ionized gas towards three disk stars. These values of [Al/S]_i (=[Al/H]_i)
imply that Al-bearing grains are present in the ionized nebulae around these
stars. If the WIM of the Galaxy is photoionized by OB stars, our data for two
halo stars imply [Al/S]_i = -0.4 to -0.5 in the WIM and thus the presence of
dust grains containing Al in this important phase of the ISM. While
photoionization appears to be the most likely origin of the ionization for Al
III and S III, we cannot rule out confusion from the presence of hot,
collisionally ionized gas along two sightlines. We find that [Al/S]_i in the
ionized gas along the six sightlines is anti-correlated with the electron
density and average sightline neutral density. The degree of grain destruction
in the ionized medium of the Galaxy is not much higher than in the warm neutral
medium. The existence of grains in the ionized regions studied here has
important implications for the thermal balance of these regions. (Abstract

constant, although no optical counterpart has thus far been observed down to
I=24.2. We have obtained new sub-millimetre detections at 450, 850 and 1350
microns. We have also constrained the possible dust emission from the proposed
foreground lensing galaxy using a K-band adaptive optics image and CO(5-4)
measurements. A lensing model is constructed, taking the foreground elliptical
galaxy at z=0.755 as the lensing mass. From this we derive a scenario from
which to model the sub-millimetre emission. Several arguments then point to the
source in the B1933+503 system lying above a redshift of 2. We speculate that
unlensed relatives of this source may constitute a sizable fraction of the 850
micron source counts.

We present results on the evolution of velocity function of DM halos, compare

virialized objects determined from the simulation is in good agreement with

happens if the halos fall into clusters or groups. We discuss the dependence of

history.

confronted with some recent observational data. Assuming that $p_X/\rho_X<-0.6$
we find that the required amount of the ``X'' component is not ruled out by the
supernova limits. Since the value of energy density parameter $\Omega_{v0}$ for
cosmological constant larger than 1 is excluded by gravitational lensing
observations the value of the ratio $p_X/\rho_X$ should lie between the values
-1 and -0.6 if the model has to be free of the horizon problem beeing at the
same time consistent with observations. The value of $\Omega_{X0}+\Omega_{m0}$
in the model is consistent with the constraints $0.2<\Omega_{\text{tot}}<1.5$
following from cosmic microwave background observations provided that
$\Omega_{m0}$ is low ($<0.2$).

Title:Fireball/Blastwave Model and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters,"
Abstract:  Soft gamma-ray repeaters are at determined distances and their positions are
known accurately. If observed, afterglows from their soft gamma-ray bursts will
provide important clues to the study of the so called ""classical gamma-ray
bursts"". On applying the popular fireball/blastwave model of classical
gamma-ray bursts to soft gamma-ray repeaters, it is found that their X-ray and
optical afterglows are detectable. Monitoring of the three repeaters is
solicited.

Title:Reprocessing and Variable Cold Absorption in the Broad-Line Radio Galaxy 3C390.3,"
Abstract:  A BeppoSAX observation of the BLRG 3C390.3 is reported. For the first time,
both the 6.4 keV iron line and a strong reflection hump, produced by the
illumination of the primary X-ray emission on cold matter, are detected in this
source. The 0.1-100 keV continuum is modeled by an absorbed power law (\Gamma~
1.8) reflected at high energies by material with a fairly large covering factor
(\Omega/2\pi~1). The iron line is intrinsically narrow ($\sigma=73(+207,-73)
eV) and has an equivalent width of ~140$ eV. We discuss the results in the
context of current models for AGNs and suggest that the primary X-ray power law
continuum is probably produced by a hot inner flow, while the reprocessed
radiation comes from an outer cold thin disk, and/or from a thick torus at even
larger radii. Further observations with BeppoSAX could distinguish between the
latter two cases. Beamed radiation associated to the radio jet is unlikely to
contribute significantly to the X-ray emission. Finally, an historical study of
the column density NH, also reported here, shows that the absorption along the
line of sight changes in time. The NH time variability, which is not correlated
with that of the primary continuum, seems to imply variations of the geometry
of the absorber rather than variations in the ionization state of the gas.

Title:The Magnetic Association of Coronal Bright Points,"
Abstract:  Several coronal bright points identified in a quiet region of the Sun from
SOHO/EIT Fe XII images are found to have a time evolution from birth to decay
which is extremely well correlated with the rise and fall of magnetic flux as
determined from photospheric magnetograms made with the SOHO/MDI instrument.
Radiative losses of the bright points are found to be much less than conductive
losses but the sum of the two is comparable with the available energy of the
associated magnetic field. Several small `network flares' occur during the
lifetimes of these bright points, emphasizing the strong connection of such
events with the magnetic field.

Title:NICMOS and VLBA observations of the gravitational lens system B1933+503,"
Abstract:  NICMOS observations of the complex gravitational lens system B1933+503 reveal
infrared counterparts to two of the inverted spectrum radio images. The
infrared images have arc-like structures. The corresponding radio images are
also detected in a VLBA map made at 1.7 GHz with a resolution of 6 mas. We fail
to detect two of the four inverted radio spectrum components with the VLBA even
though they are clearly visible in a MERLIN map at the same frequency at a
different epoch. The absence of these two components could be due to rapid
variability on a time-scale less than the time delay, or to broadening of the
images during propagation of the radio waves through the ISM of the lensing
galaxy to an extent that they fall below the surface brightness detectability
threshold of the VLBA observations. The failure to detect the same two images
with NICMOS is probably due to extinction in the ISM of the lensing galaxy.

Title:UV Diagnostics of the Interaction between Starburst Galaxies and the Intergalactic Medium,"
Abstract:  Both galaxies and the intergalactic medium evolve dramatically between $z
\approx 2$ and the present. These changes are coupled via galactic winds, cloud
accretion, and ionizing radiation. Measurements of these interactions are
critical for building a physical understanding of galaxy assembly. This paper
reviews the role of starburst galaxies in heating, enriching, and ionizing the
intergalactic medium. The strategies used to address these problems rely
heavily on access to the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. Rather modest
gains in UV sensitivity are shown to produce enormous gains in our ability to
follow the very low-density gas dispersed by galactic winds and galaxy
interactions. This leverage results from the sensitivity of absorption lines to
low ionic columns and the very steep rise in the areal density of quasars
toward fainter magnitudes.

Abstract:  The data from the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m telescope Galactic Center
CO survey have been analyzed to generate a compilation of molecular clouds with
intense CO emission in this region. Clouds are identified in an automated
manner throughout the main part of the survey data for all CO emission peaks
exceeding 10 K ($T_R^*$). Correlations between the size, velocity dispersion,
virial mass, and the CO luminosity, for the molecular clouds in the Galactic

assuming that the disk clouds are nearly at the onset of gravitational
instability. Most of the clouds and cloud complexes in the Galactic center are
gravitationally stable, while some clouds with intense CO emission are

Title:Variability of the HeI5876 A line in early type chemically peculiar stars,"
Abstract:  Chemically peculiar stars present spectral and photometric variability with a
single period. In the oblique rotator model, the non homogeneous distribution
of elements on the stellar surface is at the origin of the observed variations.
As to helium weak stars, it has been suggested that photometric and helium line
equivalent width variations are out of phase. To understand the behaviour of
helium in CP stars, we have obtained time resolved spectra of the HeI5876 A
line for a sample of 16 chemically peculiar stars in the spectral range B3 --
A1 and belonging to different sub-groups. The HeI5876 A line is too weak to be
measured in the spectra of the stars HD 24155, HD 41269, and HD 220825. No
variation of the equivalent width of the selected He line has been revealed in
the stars HD 22920, HD 24587, HD 36589, HD 49606, and HD 209515. The equivalent
width variation of the HeI5876 A line is in phase with the photometric
variability for the stars HD 43819, HD 171247 and HD 176582. On the contrary it
is out of phase for the stars HD 28843, HD 182255 and HD 223640. No clear
relation has been found for the stars HD 26571 and HD 177003.

Title:Why are Halo Density Profiles Stable at Formation?,"
Abstract:  We analyze the physical justification of the picture proposed by
Salvador-Sole et al. in these proceedings for the time evolution of the
universal density profile of dark-matter halos. According to this picture,
halos have at formation a stable (i.e. independent of mass and time)
dimensionless density profile, the characteristic length and density scales of
the profile depending on the underlying cosmogony. Subsequent evolution is
driven by mass accretion onto the outskirts of halos and can be characterized
simply by the increment of halo radius with time and the corresponding decrease
of the critical density of the universe. We find this picture to be a
reasonable good description of the expected evolution of halos in hierarchical
models of structure formation.

Title:The Isolated Elliptical NGC 1132: Evidence For a Merged Group of Galaxies?,"
Abstract:  Numerical simulations predict that some poor groups of galaxies have merged
by the present epoch into giant ellipticals (cf. Barnes 1989). To identify the
possible remnants of such mergers, we have compiled a sample of nearby,
isolated ellipticals (Colbert, Mulchaey, & Zabludoff 1998). ASCA observations
of the first galaxy studied, NGC 1132 reveal an X-ray halo that extends out to
at least 250 kpc. The temperature, metallicity and luminosity of NGC 1132's
X-ray halo are comparable to those of poor group halos. The total mass inferred
from the X-ray emission is also like that of an X-ray detected group. Optical
imaging uncovers a dwarf galaxy population clustered about NGC 1132 that is
consistent in number density and in projected radial distribution with that of
an X-ray group. The similarities of NGC 1132 to poor groups in both the X-ray
band and at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function, combined with the
deficit of luminous galaxies in the NGC 1132 field, are compatible with the
merged group picture. Another possibility is that the NGC 1132 system is a
`failed' group (i.e., a local overdensity in which other bright galaxies never
formed).

Title:Stellar Absolute Magnitudes via the Statistical Parallax Method,"
Abstract:  I review statistical parallax absolute magnitude determinations which employ
data from the HIPPARCOS satellite for RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables, and for
several other stellar classes. Five groups have studied the RR Lyrae stars, and
the results are reassuringly consistent: M_V(RR) = 0.77 +- 0.13 mag at [Fe/H] =
-1.6 dex. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations showed that systematic errors are
small (~0.03 mag or less), and corrections for them were applied in the above
result. The RR Lyrae result is thus very secure. A statistical parallax study
of Cepheids found the Period--Luminosity zero-point to be considerably fainter
than studies based on HIPPARCOS trigonometric parallaxes. The distance modulus
of the Large Magellanic Cloud derived from this zero-point is in excellent
agreement with that derived using the RR Lyrae result. I discuss why the
statistical parallax absolute magnitude calibrations differ with some other RR
Lyrae and Cepheid calibrations.

Title:Fringe Visibility Estimators for the Palomar Testbed Interferometer,"
Abstract:  Visibility estimators and their performance are presented for use with the
Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI). One operational mode of PTI is
single-baseline visibility measurement using pathlength modulation with
synchronous readout by a NICMOS-3 infrared array. Visibility is estimated from
the fringe quadratures, either incoherently, or using source phase referencing
to provide a longer coherent integration time. The visibility estimators differ
those used with photon-counting detectors in order to account for biases
attributable to detector offsets and read noise. The performance of these
estimators is affected not only by photon noise, but also by the detector read
noise and errors in estimating the bias corrections, which affect the
incoherent and coherent estimators differently. Corrections for visibility loss
in the coherent estimators using the measured tracking jitter are also
presented.

Abstract:  The bright persistent X-ray source and type I X-ray burster 1E1724-3045
located in the globular cluster Terzan 2 was observed by ASCA for about 10 ksec
on September 24-25th, 1995 while it was in its hard state, with a luminosity of
\~6x10^36 erg/s in the 0.5-10 keV band (d=7.7 kpc). The ASCA spectrum is hard,
and reveals the presence of a soft component below 2-3 keV. When combined with
non simultaneous RXTE/HEXTE data, we show that the ASCA spectrum can be
adequately fitted by a Comptonization model for which the electron temperature
is ~30 keV, the optical depth is ~3 for a spherical scattering cloud. The soft
component carries off about 13%, and 35% of the 0.1-200 keV luminosity for a
blackbody and disk blackbody fit respectively. It is more likely to arise from
the accretion disk, whereas the hard Comptonized component is generated in a
hot boundary layer interior to the disk. The column density measured towards
the source (NH=10^22 cm^-2) is consistent with the value expected from the
optical reddening of the cluster. No emission lines were detected, and an upper
limit of 30 eV for the equivalent width of a 6.4 keV line (sigma=0.1 keV) has
been derived.

BAL QSO H1413+1143 based on the HST WFPC/WFPC2 astrometric and photometric data
of the system by Turnshek et al. and the HST NICMOS-2 data by Falco et al. The
accurate image positions and the dust-extinction-corrected relative
amplifications, along with a possible detection of the lensing galaxy in the
infrared, permit more accurate lens models than were previously possible. While
more recent models are qualitatively consistent with the HST data, none of the
previous models considered the dust-extinction-corrected relative
amplifications of the image components. We use the power-law elliptical mass
model to fit the HST data. We find that a single elliptical galaxy perturbed by
an external shear can fit the image positions within the observational
uncertainties; however, the predicted relative magnifications are only roughly
consistent with the observational relative amplifications. We find that a
primary galaxy combined with a secondary galaxy in the vicinity of the
Cloverleaf or a cluster centered (south-)west of the Cloverleaf can fit both
the image positions and relative amplifications within the observational
uncertainties. We discuss future observations which could be used to test
and/or further constrain lens models of the Cloverleaf.

Title:An Alignment Effect in FR I Radio Galaxies: U-band Polarimetry of the Abell 2597 Cluster Central Galaxy,"
Abstract:  We have obtained U-band polarimetry of the spatially extended, blue optical
continuum associated with the FR I radio source PKS 2322-122. PKS 2322-122 is
located in the Abell 2597 cluster central galaxy. We find a three sigma upper
limit to the degree of polarization of the optical continuum of less than 6%.
This limit is inconsistent with the blue continuum being primarily scattered
light or synchrotron radiation. We can therefore exclude models which attribute
the blue continuum to scattered light from an active nucleus that is hidden
from direct view. Essentially all of the data pertaining to the blue continuum
along the radio source-the ``blue lobes''-indicate that they are regions of
recent star formation that may have been induced by an interaction between the
radio source and the cool ($<10^4$ K), surrounding gas. We compare the
restframe U-band polarized luminosities and 1.4 GHz radio powers of A2597 and
A1795 to those for several high redshift radio galaxies exhibiting the
alignment effect. We suggest that the fundamental property distinguishing some
powerful, high redshift radio galaxies exhibiting the alignment effect, and the
lower-power, FR I radio galaxies in cooling flows that exhibit the blue lobe
phenomenon, is the strength of the AGN.

curves for a sample of 522 spiral galaxies, from which an accurate TF template

the template to compute cluster peculiar motions.
The reflex motion of the Local Group of galaxies is measured with respect to
the reference frame defined by our cluster sample and the distant portion of
the Giovanelli et al. (1998) cluster set. We find the Local Group motion in
this frame to be 565+/-113 km/s in the direction (l,b)=(267,26)+/-10 when
peculiar velocities are weighted according to their errors. After optimizing
the dipole calculation to sample equal volumes equally, the vector is 509+/-195
km/s towards (255,33)+/-22. Both solutions agree, to within 1-sigma or better,
with the Local Group motion as inferred from the cosmic microwave background

reference frame, its bulk flow being at most 200 km/s.

Title:The conductivity of dense molecular gas,"
Abstract:  We evaluate the conductivity tensor for molecular gas at densities ranging
from 10^4 to 10^15 cm^-3 for a variety of grain models. The Hall contribution
to the conductivity has generally been neglected in treatments of the dynamics
of molecular gas. We find that it is not important if only 0.1 micron grains
are considered, but for a Mathis-Rumpl-Nordsieck grain-size distribution (with
or without PAHs) it becomes important for densities between 10^7 and 10^11
cm^-3. If PAHs are included, this range is reduced to 10^9 -- 10^10 cm^-3.
The consequences for the magnetic field evolution and dynamics of dense
molecular gas are profound. To illustrate this, we consider the propagation of
Alfven waves under these conditions. A linear analysis yields a dispersion
relation valid for frequencies below the neutral collision frequencies of the
charged species. The dispersion relation shows that there is a pair of
circularly polarised modes with distinct propagation speeds and damping rates.
We note that the gravitational collapse of dense cloud cores may be
substantially modified by the Hall term.

Title:The Escape of Ionizing Photons from the Galaxy,"
Abstract:  The Magellanic Stream and several high velocity clouds have now been detected

most plausibly explained by photoionization due to hot, young stars in the
Galactic disk. The highly favorable orientation of the Stream allows an
unambiguous determination of the fraction of ionizing photons, F_esc, which
escape the disk. We have modelled the production and transport of ionizing
photons through an opaque interstellar medium. Normalization to the Stream
detections requires F_esc = 6%, in reasonable agreement with the flux required
to ionize the Reynolds layer. Neither shock heating nor emission within a hot
Galactic corona can be important in producing the observed H-alpha emission. If
such a large escape fraction is typical of L_* galaxies, star-forming systems
dominate the extragalactic ionizing background. Within the context of this
model, both the three-dimensional orientation of the Stream and the distances
to high-velocity clouds can be determined by sensitive H-alpha observations.

Title:Runaway Heating By R-modes of Neutron Stars in Low Mass X-ray Binaries,"
Abstract:  Recently Andersson et. al., and Bildsten have independently suggested that an
r-mode instability might be responsible for stalling the neutron-star spin-up
in strongly accreting, Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs). We show that if this
does occur, then there are two possibilities for the resulting neutron-star
evolution:
If the r-mode damping is a decreasing function of temperature, then the star
undergoes a cyclic evolution: (i) accretional spin-up triggers the instability
near the observed maximum spin rate; (ii) the r-modes become highly excited
through gravitational-radiation reaction, and in a fraction of a year they
viscously heat the star; (iii) r-mode gravitational-radiation reaction then
spins the star down in a fraction of a year to some limiting rotational
frequency; (iv) the r-mode instability shuts off; (v) the neutron star slowly
cools and is spun up by accretion, until it once again reaches the instability
point, closing the cycle. The shortness of the epoch of r-mode activity makes
it unlikely that r-modes are currently excited in the neutron star of any
galactic LMXBs. Nevertheless, this cyclic evolution could be responsible for
keeping the rotational frequencies within the observed LMXB frequency range.
If, on the other hand, the r-mode damping is temperature independent, then a
steady state with constant angular velocity and $T_{\rm core}\simeq 4\times
10^8$K is reached, in which r-mode viscous heating is balanced by neutrino
cooling and accretional spin-up torque is balanced by
gravitational-radiation-reaction spin-down torque. In this case the neutron
stars in LMXBs could be potential sources of periodic gravitational waves,
detectable by enhanced LIGO interferometers.

variety of ages, including very young stars with approximately 10^7 yr. Our
main result is to establish the presence of a halo consisting of population II
stars, extending out to about 4.5 arcmin (or 1.8 kpc) above and below the plane
of this galaxy. For these old stars we derive an age of > 10 Gyr and a
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.8 +/- 0.2. We construct a deep luminosity function,
obtaining an accurate distance modulus (m-M)_0 = 25.62 +/- 0.1 for this galaxy

= 0.05.

Title:Severe Limits on Variations of the Speed of Light with Frequency,"
Abstract:  Explosive astrophysical events at high red shift can be used to place severe
limits on the fractional variation in the speed of light ($\Delta c/c$), the
photon mass ($m_{\gamma}$), and the energy scale of quantum gravity ($E_{QG}$).
I find $\Delta c/c < 6.3 \times 10^{-21}$ based on the simultaneous arrival of
a flare in GRB 930229 with a rise time of $220 \pm 30 \mu s$ for photons of 30
keV and 200 keV. The limit on $m_{\gamma}$ is $4.2 \times 10^{-44} g$ for GRB
980703 from radio to gamma ray observations. The limit on $E_{QG}$ is $8.3
\times 10^{16}$ GeV for GRB 930131 from 30 keV to 80 MeV photons.

Title:An ultra-deep ISOCAM observation through a cluster-lens,"
Abstract:  We present results of ultra-deep ISOCAM observations through a cluster-lens
at 7 and 15 micron with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) satellite. These
observations reveal a large number of luminous Mid-Infrared (MIR) sources.
Cross-identification in the optical and Near-Infrared (NIR) wavebands shows
that about half of the 7 micron sources are cluster galaxies. The other 7
micron and almost all 15 micron sources are identified as lensed distant
galaxies. Thanks to the gravitational amplification they constitute the
faintest MIR detected sources, allowing us to extend the number counts in both
the 7 and 15 micron bands. In particular, we find that the 15 micron counts
have a steep slope alpha_15 = -1.5 +/- 0.3 and are large, with N_15 (>30
microJy}) = 13 +/- 5 per square arcmin. These numbers rule out non-evolutionary
models and favour very strong evolution. Down to our counts limit, we found
that the resolved 7 and 15 microns background radiation intensity is
respectively (2 +/-0.5) 10^(-9) and (5 +/-1) 10^(-9) W m^(-2) sr^(-1).

Title:A Cutoff in the X-ray Fluctuation Power Density Spectrum of the Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 3516,"
Abstract:  During 1997 March-July, XTE observed the bright, strongly variable Seyfert 1
galaxy NGC 3516 once every ~12.8 hr for 4.5 months and nearly continuously
(with interruptions due to SAA passage but not Earth occultation) for a 4.2 day
period in the middle. These were followed by ongoing monitoring once every ~4.3
days. These data are used to construct the first well-determined X-ray
fluctuation power density spectrum (PDS) of an active galaxy to span more than
4 decades of usable temporal frequency. The PDS shows no signs of any strict or
quasi-periodicity, but does show a progressive flattening of the power-law
slope from -1.74 at short time scales to -0.73 at longer time scales. This is
the clearest observation to date of the long-predicted cutoff in the PDS. The
characteristic variability time scale corresponding to this cutoff temporal
frequency is 1 month. Although it is unclear how this time scale may be
interpreted in terms of a physical size or process, there are several promising
candidate models. The PDS appears similar to those seen for Galactic black hole
candidates such as Cyg X-1, suggesting that these two classes of objects with
very different luminosities and putative black hole masses (differing by more
than a factor of 10^5) may have similar X-ray generation processes and
structures.

Title:Quasar-galaxy and AGN-galaxy cross-correlations,"
Abstract:  We compute quasar-galaxy and AGN-galaxy cross-correlation functions for
samples taken from the \cite{VCV98} catalog of quasars and active galaxies,
using tracer galaxies taken from the Edinburgh/Durham Southern Catalog. The
sample of active galaxy targets shows positive correlation at projected
separations $r_p < 6 h^{-1} Mpc$ consistent with the usual power-law. On the
other hand, we do not find a statistically significant positive quasar-galaxy
correlation signal except in the range $3 h^{-1} Mpc < r_p < 6 h^{-1} Mpc$
where we find similar AGN-galaxy and quasar-galaxy correlation amplitudes. At
separations $r_p<3 h^{-1} Mpc$ a strong decline of quasar-galaxy correlations
is observed, suggesting a significant local influence of quasars in galaxy
formation. In an attempt to reproduce the observed cross-correlation between
quasars and galaxies, we have performed CDM cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations and tested the viability of a scenario based on the model developed
by \cite{silkrees98}. In this scheme a fraction of the energy released by
quasars is considered to be transferred into the baryonic component of the
intergalactic medium in the form of winds. The results of the simulations
suggest that the shape of the observed quasar-galaxy cross-correlation function
could be understood in a scenario where a substantial amount of energy is
transferred to the medium at the redshift of maximum quasar activity.

Title:Gravitational Radiation From Globular Clusters,"
Abstract:  Space-based gravitational wave detectors will have the ability to observe
continuous low frequency gravitational radiation from binary star systems. They
can determine the direction to continuous sources with an angular resolution
approaching tens of arcminutes. This resolution should be sufficient to
identify binary sources as members of some nearby globular clusters. Thus,
gravitational radiation can be used to determine the population of hard
binaries in globular clusters. For particularly hard binaries, the orbital
period may change as a result of gravitational wave emission. If one of these
binaries can be identified with a globular cluster, then the distance to that
cluster can be determined. Thus, gravitational radiation may provide
reddening-independent distance measurements to globular clusters.

Title:Cm-Wavelength Total Flux and Linear Polarization Properties of Radio-Loud BL Lacertae Objects,"
Abstract:  Results from a long-term program to quantify the range of behavior of the
cm-wavelength total flux and linear polarization variability properties of a
sample of 41 radio-loud BL Lac objects using weekly to tri-monthly observations
with the University of Michigan 26-m telescope operating at 14.5, 8.0, and 4.8
GHz are presented; these observations are used to identify class-dependent
differences between these BL Lacs and QSOs in the Pearson-Readhead sample. The
BL Lacs are found to be more highly variable in total flux density than the
QSOs, exhibiting changes that are often nearly-simultaneous and of comparable
amplitude at 14.5 and 4.8 GHz in contrast to the behavior in the QSOs and
supporting the existence of class-dependent differences in opacity within the
parsec-scale jet flows. Structure function analyses of the flux observations
quantify that a characteristic timescale is identifiable in only 1/3 of the BL
Lacs. The time-averaged fractional linear polarizations are only on the order
of a few percent and are consistent with the presence of tangled magnetic
fields within the emitting regions. In many sources a preferred long-term
orientation of the EVPA is present; when compared with the VLBI structural
axis, no preferred position angle difference is identified. The polarized flux
typically exhibits variability with timescales of months to a few years and
shows the signature of a propagating shock during several resolved outbursts.
The observations indicate that the source emission is predominately due to
evolving source components and support the occurrence of more frequent shock
formation in BL Lac parsec-scale flows than in QSO jets. The differences in
variability behavior and polarization between BL Lacs and QSOs can be explained
by differences in jet stability.

Abstract:  We present a Bayesian inference analysis of the Markevitch (1998) and Allen &
Fabian (1998) cooling flow corrected X-ray cluster temperature catalogs that
constrains the slope and the evolution of the empirical X-ray cluster
luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation. We find that for the luminosity range
10^44.5 erg s^-1 < L_bol < 10^46.5 erg s^-1 and the redshift range z < 0.5,
L_bol is proportional to T^2.80(+0.15/-0.15)(1+z)^(0.91-1.12q_0)(+0.54/-1.22).
We also determine the L-T relation that one should use when fitting the Press-
Schechter mass function to X-ray cluster luminosity catalogs such as the
Einstein Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS) and the Southern Serendipitous High-
Redshift Archival ROSAT Catalog (Southern SHARC), for which cooling flow
corrected luminosities are not determined and a universal X-ray cluster
temperature of T = 6 keV is assumed. In this case, L_bol is proportional to

Title:The Case for a Next Generation LMC Microlensing Survey,"
Abstract:  Microlensing surveys search for the transient brightening of a background
star that is the signature of gravitational lensing by a foreground compact
object. This technique is an elegant way to search for astrophysical candidates
that might comprise the dark matter halo of the Milky Way. While the current
projects have successfully detected the phenomenon of microlensing and have
reported many important results, the relatively large event rate reported
towards the LMC remains a puzzle. The first step in resolving this mystery is
determining the location of the excess lensing population. This will require a
microlensing survey with an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity over
current projects. I summarize the present status of microlensing surveys, and
present (and advocate!) a next-generation project that should be capable of
unambiguously determining whether the dark halo of the Galaxy is indeed made up
of MACHOs, or whether the observed events are due to previously unappreciated
ordinary stellar populations.

Title:Accretion Disc Evolution in Single and Binary T Tauri Stars,"
Abstract:  We present theoretical models for the evolution of T Tauri stars surrounded
by circumstellar discs. The models include the effects of pre-main-sequence
stellar and time dependent disc evolution, and incorporate the effects of
stellar magnetic fields acting on the inner disc. For single stars, consistency
with observations in Taurus-Auriga demands that disc dispersal occurs rapidly,
on much less than the viscous timescale of the disc, at roughly the epoch when
heating by stellar radiation first dominates over internal viscous dissipation.
Applying the models to close binaries, we find that because the initial
conditions for discs in binaries are uncertain, studies of extreme mass ratio
systems are required to provide a stringent test of theoretical disc evolution
models. We also note that no correlation of the infra-red colours of T Tauri
stars with their rotation rate is observed, in apparent contradiction to the
predictions of simple magnetospheric accretion models.

"Title:Possible High-Redshift, Low-Luminosity AGN Activity in the Hubble Deep Field","
Abstract:  In the Hubble Deep Field (HDF), twelve candidate sources of high-redshift (z
> 3.5) AGN activity have been identified. The color selection criteria were
established by passing spectra of selected quasars and Seyfert galaxies
(appropriately redshifted and modified for ""Lyman forest"" absorption), as well
as stars, observed normal and starburst galaxies, and galaxy models for various
redshifts through the filters used for the HDF observations. The actual
identification of AGN candidates also involved convolving a
Laplacian-of-Gaussian filter with the HDF images, thereby removing relatively
flat galactic backgrounds and leaving only the point-like components in the
centers. Along with positions and colors, estimated redshifts and absolute
magnitudes are reported, with the candidates falling toward the faint end of
the AGN luminosity function. One candidate has been previously observed
spectroscopically, with a measured redshift of 4.02. The number of sources
reported here is consistent with a simple extrapolation of the observed quasar
luminosity function to magnitude 30 in B_Johnson. Implications for ionization
of the intergalactic medium and for gravitational lensing are discussed.

Title:Hard X-ray variability of the black-hole candidate GRO J0422+32 during its 1992 outburst,"
Abstract:  We have studied the hard X-ray variability of the soft X-ray transient GRO
J0422+32 with BATSE in the 20-100 keV energy band. Our analysis covers 180 days
following the first X-ray detection of the source on 1992 August 5, fully
covering its primary and secondary X-ray outburst. We computed power density
spectra (PDSs) in the 20-50, 50-100, and 20-100 keV energy bands, in the
frequency interval 0.002-0.488 Hz. The PDSs of GRO J0422+32 are approximately
flat up to a break frequency, and decay as a power law above, with index ~1.
The canonical anticorrelation between the break frequency and the power density
at the break, observed in Cyg X-1 and other BHCs in the low state, is not
observed in the PDSs of GRO J0422+32. We compare our results with those of
similar variability studies of Cyg X-1. The relation between the spectral slope
and the amplitude of the X-ray variations of GRO J0422+32 is similar to that of
Cyg X-1; however, the relation between the hard X-ray flux and the amplitude of
its variation is opposite to what has been found in Cyg X-1. Phase lags between
the X-ray flux variations of GRO J0422+32 at high and low photon energies,
could only be derived during the first 30 days of its outburst. During this
period, the variations in the 50-100 keV lag those in the 20-50 keV energy band

interval 0.02-0.20 Hz.

Title:The dynamical tide in a rotating 10 Msun main sequence star,"
Abstract:  We study the linear, but fully non-adiabatic tidal response of a uniformly
rotating, somewhat evolved X_c=0.4, 10 Msun main sequence star to the dominant
l=2 components of its binary companion's tidal potential. This is done
numerically with a 2D implicit finite difference scheme. We assume the spin
vector of the 10 Msun star to be aligned perpendicular to the orbital plane and
calculate the frequency and width of the resonances with the prograde and
retrograde gravity (g) modes as well as the resonances with quasi-toroidal
rotational (r) modes for varying rotation rates of the main sequence star. For
all applied forcing frequencies we determine the rate of tidal energy and
angular momentum exchange with the companion. In a rotating star tidal energy
is transferred from l=2 g-modes to g-modes of higher spherical degree
(l=4,6,8,...) by the Coriolis force. These latter modes have shorter wavelength
and are damped more heavily, so that the l=2 resonant tidal interaction tends
to be reduced for large stellar rotation rates. On the other hand, the density
of potential resonances (a broad l spectrum) increases. We find several
inertially excited unstable l>4 g-modes, but not more than one (retrograde)
unstable l=2 g-mode and that only for rapid rotation. Our numerical results can
be applied to study the tidal evolution of eccentric binaries containing early
type B-star components.

approximately constant along the jet. Synchrotron appears as the most plausible
mechanism for the observed jet emission at radio and optical wavelengths. Local
particle reacceleration or, alternatively, deviation from the condition of
equipartition, are plausible mechanisms to explain the low synchrotron cooling
and constant spectral index in the jet of 3C264.

Title:Is Cosmology Solved?,"
Abstract:  We have fossil evidence from the thermal background radiation that our
universe expanded from a considerably hotter denser state. We have a well
defined and testable description of the expansion, the relativistic
Friedmann-Lemaitre model. Its observational successes are impressive but I
think hardly enough for a convincing scientific case. The lists of
observational constraints and free hypotheses within the model have similar
lengths. The scorecard on the search for concordant measures of the mass
density parameter and the cosmological constant shows that the high density
Einstein-de Sitter model is challenged, but that we cannot choose between low
density models with and without a cosmological constant. That is, the
relativistic model is not strongly overconstrained, the usual test of a mature
theory. Work in progress will greatly improve the situation and may at last
yield a compelling test. If so, and the relativistic model survives, it will
close one line of research in cosmology: we will know the outlines of what
happened as our universe expanded and cooled from high density. It will not end
research: some of us will occupy ourselves with the details of how galaxies and
other large-scale structures came to be the way they are, others with the issue
of what our universe was doing before it was expanding. The former is being
driven by rapid observational advances. The latter is being driven mainly by
theory, but there are hints of observational guidance.

Title:Hot Gas in Clusters of Galaxies: the Punctuated Equilibria Model,"
Abstract:  We develop a model to describe the evolution of the intra-cluster X-ray
emitting baryons, as they are included in the dark matter potential wells of
galaxy clusters evolving through subsequent merging events in the framework of
hierarchical clustering. The gas is assumed to re-adjusts to a new hydrostatic
equilibrium after each merging event. Before merging it is gravitationally
heated at the local virial temperature when bound in subclusters; at early $z$
the gas is preheated by supernova activity following star formation. In detail,
we compute analytically the following steps: the dynamic histories of dark
matter halos with their merging events; the associated infall of gas into a
halo, with compressions and shocks estabilishing the conditions at the cluster
boundary; the updated disposition of the gas in the potential well matching
such conditions; the statistical convolution of the key quantities over the
merging histories. The model predicts the density and surface brightness
profiles with no free parameters; the so-called $\beta$ parameter is itself an
outcome of the model, and the polytropic index $\gamma$ is internally
constrained to a narrow range. We obtain declining temperature profiles, and
profiles for the density and for the surface brightness shallower in groups
compared with clusters. Our model groups also contain a lower baryonic fraction
on average, but with a scatter considerably larger than at cluster scales.
Various statistics are obtained analytically upon averaging over the merging
histories. In particular, we predict in different cosmologies the statistical
correlation $L-T$ of luminosity with temperature; similarly we derivethe
correlation $R_X-T$ for the size of the X-ray emitting region. The intrinsic
scatter in both correlations is also predicted.

which the masers form in an expanding and rotating protostellar disk. Rather,
we find that the symmetry evident in the SiO maser emission points towards its
genesis in a bipolar outflow. Water masers which also appear towards Orion-KL
are known to share the velocity profile and double peaked characteristics of
the SiO maser emission yet form much further away from the protostar. We link
the water masers to our present results by proposing that both species of maser
form around a flared molecular outflow of roughly constant velocity.

Abstract:  We summarize several results based on the velocity data-set for cluster

the distribution of velocity dispersions of a complete sample of rich galaxy
clusters, and compare it to the distribution of cluster X-ray temperatures, and
with predictions of theoretical models. We then address the issue of the
existence of a Fundamental Plane (FP) for rich clusters, first suggested by
Schaeffer et al. We confirm the existence of this FP with the ENACS data-set.
The cluster FP is different from the FP of elliptical galaxies, and from the
virial prediction. Some implications of the cluster FP are discussed. Finally,
we describe the phase-space distributions of different populations of cluster
galaxies. Different galaxy classes are defined according to their morphological
or spectral type, and the presence of emission-lines. Star-forming (late-type)
galaxies have a velocity dispersion profile that (in combination with their
wider spatial distribution) is suggestive of first infall into the cluster. On
the contrary, quiescent (early-type) galaxies show evidence of a dynamically
relaxed distribution.

Abstract:  An extremely careful separation of the weak metal-line systems relating to

components with accurate parameters has yielded a large sample in the wide
redshift range 1.9 < z < 4.4. The systems typically span several hundred km/s
and within each the components show a strong coherence in their ionization
properties. No sudden evolution is found in the column density ratio N(Si
IV)/N(C IV), contrary to previous indication of a large change near z = 3,
although there is an apparent rise below z~2.2 and above z~3.8. A smooth not
sudden spectral evolution is reflected in the z distribution of N(N V)/N(C IV).
Comparisons of N(Si IV)/N(C IV) vs N(C II)/N(C IV) from the observations with
CLOUDY derived values using several model ionizing spectra show the general
dominance of a QSO ionizing background at the lower redshifts while an
additional strong and eventually dominating stellar contribution is required
progressively to higher redshifts.

Title:Binary fraction in low-mass star forming regions: a reexamination of the possible excesses and implications,"
Abstract:  Various surveys of low-mass binaries in star forming regions have been
performed in recent years. They reached opposite conclusions concerning
possible binary excesses in some of these associations. I develop a consistent
method to reanalyze all these studies, so that I can compare all data
consistently, and understand the previous findings. I also report the detection
of five new companions to Taurus members.
It appears that binary fraction in Taurus exceeds the main sequence value by
a factor of 1.7 in the range 4-2000 AU. The companion star fraction in this
separation range is the same as the overall main sequence fraction. Ophiuchus,
Chameleon, and possibly Lupus show similar excesses, although with lower
confidence levels. Binaries in Ophiuchus seem to have larger flux ratios
(towards faint companions) than in Taurus.
It appears very unlikely that all very young star forming regions have binary
excesses. The binary fraction seems to be established after $\sim$ 1 Myr, but
the precise nature of the difference between various regions is still unclear
(overall binary fraction, orbital period distribution). It is not currently
possible to put constraints on the binary formation models: higher angular
resolution and larger sample sizes will be required.

Title:Spectroscopy of Brown Dwarf Candidates in the rho Ophiuchi Molecular Core,"
Abstract:  We present an analysis of low resolution infrared spectra for 20 brown dwarf
candidates in the core of the $\rho$ Ophiuchi molecular cloud. Fifteen of the
sources display absorption-line spectra characteristic of late-type stars. By
comparing the depths of water vapor absorption bands in our candidate objects
with a grid of M dwarf standards, we derive spectral types which are
independent of reddening. Optical spectroscopy of one brown dwarf candidate
confirms the spectral type derived from the water bands. Combining their
spectral types with published near-infrared photometry, effective temperatures
and bolometric stellar luminosities are derived enabling us to place our sample
on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We compare the positions of the brown dwarf
candidates in this diagram with two sets of theoretical models in order to
estimate their masses and ages. Considering uncertainties in placing the
candidates in the H-R diagram, six objects consistently lie in the brown dwarf
regime and another five objects lie in the transition region between stellar
and substellar objects. The ages inferred for the sample are consistent with
those derived for higher mass association members. Three of the newly
identified brown dwarfs display infrared excesses at $\lambda$=2.2 $\mu$m
suggesting that young brown dwarfs can have active accretion disks. Comparing
our mass estimates of the brown dwarf candidates with those derived from
photometric data alone suggests that spectroscopy is an essential component of
investigations of the mass functions of young clusters.

Abstract:  We present an explicit observationally acceptable model for evolution from
inflation to the present epoch under the assumption that the entropy and matter

monotonic function of the inflaton $\phi$, the inflaton energy could produce an

"Title:Gamma-ray bursts, BL Lacs, Supernovae, and Interacting Galaxies","
Abstract:  Within the framework of star formation in starburst galaxies undergoing
interactions, connections among the red quasars, the BL Lacs, and the Blazars
with the gamma-ray bursts are discussed in the light of the ""hypernovae""
scenario. It is proposed that the gamma-ray bursts occur primarily in the star
formation regions in starburst environments, and arise from the core-collapse
of super-massive Wolf-Rayet stars, that are formed in interacting systems. In
this interacting environment star formations cause supernovae explosions. As
the stars explode, shock waves propagate outward and collide with the ambient
medium, forming a high-density super-shell, where intense star formation
begins; subsequently supernovae explosions within the shell cause an outward
expansion of the shell. In another scenario of star formation the interactions
among the large gas-rich low-surface brightness (LSB) spiral galaxies give rise
to fragmentation of their tidal tails. These fragmented clouds collapse to
compact dwarfs, which undergo rapid star formation. In such a scenario of
interactions, where most quasars are observed, we discuss the MgII absorption
lines in GRB 970508, whose spectra resemble a BL Lac object, and the spectral
evolution of GRB 971214 that may also indicate a similar connection. Beside the
BL Lac connection, the recent discovery of GRB 980425 in a nearby galaxy
indicates asymmetric supernovae explosions that give rise to relativistic jets.
We propose that the gamma-ray light curves arise due to inverse Compton
scattering of soft-photons from precessing relativistic blobs of plasma moving
in jets. This brings into light the mechanisms of supernova explosions, that
give birth to relativistic jets.

"Title:The Space Density of Spiral Galaxies as function of their Luminosity, Surface Brightness and Scalesize","
Abstract:  The local space density of galaxies as a function of their basic structural
parameters --like luminosity, surface brightness and scalesize-- is still
poorly known. Our poor knowledge is mainly the result of strong selection
biases against low surface brightness and small scalesize galaxies in any
optically selected sample. We show that in order to correct for selection
biases one has to obtain accurate surface photometry and distance estimates for
a large (>~1000) sample of galaxies. We derive bivariate space density
distributions in the (scalesize, surface brightness)-plane and the (luminosity,
scalesize)-plane for a sample of ~1000 local Sb-Sdm spiral galaxies. We present
a parameterization of these bivariate distributions, based on a Schechter type
luminosity function and a log-normal scalesize distribution at a given
luminosity. We show how surface brightness limits and (1+z)^4 cosmological
redshift dimming can influence interpretation of luminosity function
determinations and deep galaxy counts.

Title:The form of cosmic string cusps,"
Abstract:  We classify the possible shapes of cosmic string cusps and how they transform
under Lorentz boosts. A generic cusp can be brought into a form in which the
motion of the cusp tip lies in the plane of the cusp. The cusp whose motion is
perpendicular to this plane, considered by some authors, is a special case and
not the generic situation.
We redo the calculation of the energy in the region where the string overlaps
itself near a cusp, which is the maximum energy that can be released in
radiation. We take into account the motion of a generic cusp and the resulting
Lorentz contraction of the string core. The result is that the energy scales as
$\sqrt {rL}$ instead of the usual value of $r^{1/3} L^{2/3}$, where $r$ is the
string radius and $L$ and is the typical length scale of the string. Since $r
<< L $ for cosmological strings, the radiation is strongly suppressed and could
not be observed.

source is a fluid with viscosity but zero heat flux (adiabatic but irreversible
evolution) whose equilibrium state variables satisfy the equations of state of:
(a) ultra-relativistic ideal gas, (b) non-relativistic ideal gas, (c) a mixture
of (a) and (b). Einstein's field equations reduce to a quadrature that is
integrable in terms of elementary functions (cases (a) and (c)) and elliptic
integrals (case (b)). Necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for the
viscous dissipative stress and equilibrium variables to be consistent with the
theoretical framework of Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics and Kinetic
Theory of the Maxwell-Boltzmann and radiative gases. Energy and regularity
conditions are discussed. We prove that a smooth matching can be performed

Title:Non-occurrence of Trapped Surfaces and Black Holes in Spherical Gravitational Collapse,"
Abstract:  We point out that although the pioneering work of Oppenheimer and Snyder
(OS), technically, indicated the formation of an event horizon for a collapsing
homogeneous dust ball of mass $M_b$ and radius $R_b$, the Eqs. (32) and (36) of
their paper actually demand that no trapped surface is formed $ 2GM_b/ R_b c^2
\le 1$, and $M_b \equiv 0$! Anybody may verify it. Further, by analyzing the
general inhomogeneous dust solutions of Tolman in a proper physical
perspective, we show that, all dust solutions are characterized by $M_b=0$.
Next, for a collapsing fluid endowed with radiation pressure, we discover that
the collapse equations obey the same Global Constraint $2GM /R c^2 \le 1$ and
which specifically shows that, contrary to the traditional intuitive Newtonian
idea, which equates the gravitational mass ($M_b$) with the fixed baryonic mass
($M_0$), the trapped surfaces are not allowed in general theory of relativity
(GTR). For continued collapse, the final gravitational mss $M_f \to 0$ as $R\to
0$. Thus we confirm Einstein's and Rosen's idea that Event Horizons and
Schwarzschild Singularities are unphysical and can not occur in Nature. This,
in turn, implies that, if there would be any continued collapse, the initial
gravitational mass energy of the fluid must be radiated away $Q\to M_i c^2$.
This also implies that, gravitational collapse of massive stars should give
rise to Ultra Compact Objects and emission of energy much more than what is
obtained in Supernova Events

gravitational energy scale. The possibility of an observable time dispersion in
high energy radiation has recently received attention in the literature, with
some suggestions that the relevant energy scale could be less than the Planck

gravitational fields produced by such vacuumless defects in the cases of both
global and gauge symmetry breaking. We find that a global monopole has a
strongly repulsive gravitational field, and its spacetime has an event horizon
similar to that in de Sitter space. A gauge monopole spacetime is essentially
that of a magnetically charged black hole. The gravitational field of a global
string is repulsive and that of a gauge string is attractive at small distances
and repulsive at large distances. Both gauge and global string spacetimes have
singularities at a finite distance from the string core.

Title:General relativistic cosmology with no beginning of time,"
Abstract:  We find that general relativity can be naturally free of cosmological
singularities. Several nonsingular models are currently available that either
assume ad hoc matter contents, or are nonsingular only over a sector of
solution space of zero measure, or depart drastically from general relativity
at high energies. After much uncertainty over whether cosmological inflation
could help solve the initial-singularity problem, the prevailing belief today
is that general relativistic cosmology, with inflation or without, is
endemically singular. This belief was reinforced by recent singularity theorems
that take account specifically of inflation. Here, a viable inflationary
cosmology is worked out that is naturally free of singularities despite the
fact that 1) it uses only classical general relativity, 2) it assumes only the
most generic inflationary matter contents, and 3) it is a theory of the
chaotic-inflation type. That type of inflation is the most widely accepted
today, as it demands the least fine-tuning of initial conditions. It is also
shown how, by dropping the usual simplification of minimal coupling between
matter and geometry, the null energy condition can be violated and the relevant
singularity theorems circumvented.

computer algebra, the linear Schwarzschild problem can be solved in a very
direct manner (i.e., without resorting to the usual function transformations),

analysis. The calculations were performed using the GRTensorII computer algebra

that we have written specifically for these types of problems. Although we have
chosen to consider only the ``quadrapole-quadrapole'' calculation in this

would allow this analysis to be repeated for a far more general problem. These

Title:Causal propagation of geometrical fields in relativistic cosmology,"
Abstract:  We employ the extended 1+3 orthonormal frame formalism for fluid spacetime
geometries $({\cal M}, {\bf g}, {\bf u})$, which contains the Bianchi field
equations for the Weyl curvature, to derive a 44-D evolution system of
first-order symmetric hyperbolic form for a set of geometrically defined
dynamical field variables. Describing the matter source fields
phenomenologically in terms of a barotropic perfect fluid, the propagation
velocities $v$ (with respect to matter-comoving observers that Fermi-propagate
their spatial reference frames) of disturbances in the matter and the
gravitational field, represented as wavefronts by the characteristic 3-surfaces
of the system, are obtained. In particular, the Weyl curvature is found to
account for two (non-Lorentz-invariant) Coulomb-like characteristic eigenfields
propagating with $v = 0$ and four transverse characteristic eigenfields
propagating with $|v| = 1$, which are well known, and four
(non-Lorentz-invariant) longitudinal characteristic eigenfields propagating
with $|v| = \sfrac{1}{2}$. The implications of this result are discussed in
some detail and a parallel is drawn to the propagation of irregularities in the
matter distribution. In a worked example, we specialise the equations to
cosmological models in locally rotationally symmetric class II and include the
constraints into the set of causally propagating dynamical variables.

that behaviour. We also present extensive numerical work backing up, and
refining, these claims, and showing in detail how a vortex can end on a black

Title:A Dynamic Solar Core Model: On the Activity-Related Changes of the Neutrino Fluxes,"
Abstract:  The energy sources of the Sun may actually involve a thermonuclear runaway
energy source present in stellar energy producing regions. I consider the
conjectures of the derived model for the solar neutrino fluxes in case of a
solar core allowed to vary in relation to the surface activity cycle. The
observed neutrino flux data suggest a solar core possibly varying in time. In
the dynamic solar model the quiet and runaway energy sources together may
produce quasi-constant flux in the SuperKamiokande because it is sensitive to
neutral currents, axions and anti-neutrinos, too. I calculate the contributions
of the runaway source to the individual neutrino detectors. The results of the
dynamic solar core model suggest that since the HOMESTAKE detects mostly the
high energy electron neutrinos, therefore the HOMESTAKE data may aniticorrelate
with the activity cycle. Activity correlated changes are expected to be present
only marginally in the GALLEX and GNO data. The gallium detectors are sensitive
mostly to the pp neutrinos, and the changes of the pp neutrinos arising from
the SSM-like core is mostly compensated by the high-energy electron neutrinos
produced by the hot bubbles of the dynamic energy source. The results suggest
that the GALLEX data may show an anti-correlation, while the SuperKamiokande
data may show a correlation with the activity cycle. Predictions of the dynamic
solar model are presented for the SNO and Borexino experiments which can
distinguish between the effects of the MSW mechanism and the consequences of
the dynamic solar model. The results of the dynamic solar model are consistent
with the present heioseismic measurements and can be checked with future
heioseismic measurements as well.

particularly in the constrained MSSM in which universal supergravity inputs at

$\chi$ is approximately a U(1) gaugino ${\tilde B}$, and constraints on the

bino mass. We show that in regions of parameter space for which the
cosmological bound is nearly saturated, coannihilations of the $\tilde B$ with
the stau, the next lightest sparticle, are important and may reduce
significantly the bino relic density. Including also bino coannihilations with
the selectrons and smuons, we find that the upper limit on $m_{\chi}$ is
increased from about 200 GeV to about 600 GeV in the constrained MSSM, with a
similar new upper limit expected in the MSSM.

mostly on production and detection of thermal relics, with mass typically in
the range a few GeV to a hundred GeV. Here, I will review scenarios for
production of nonthermal dark matter. Since the masses of the nonthermal WIMPS
are in the range 10^{12} to 10^{16} GeV, much larger than the mass of thermal
wimpy WIMPS, they may be referred to as WIMPZILLAS. In searches for dark matter
it may be well to remember that ``size does matter.''

Title:Current Status of the Solar Neutrino Problem with Super-Kamiokande,"
Abstract:  We perform an updated model-independent analysis using the latest solar
neutrino data obtained by $^{37}$Cl and $^{71}$Ga radiochemical experiments,
and most notably by a large water-Cherenkov detector SuperKamiokande with their
504 days of data taking. We confirm that the astrophysical solutions to the
solar neutrino problem are extremely disfavored by the data and a
low-temperature modification of the standard solar model is excluded by more
than 5 $\sigma$. We also propose a new way of illuminating the suppression
pattern of various solar neutrino flux without invoking detailed flavor
conversion mechanisms. It indicates that the strong suppression of $^7$Be
neutrinos is no more true when the neutrino flavor conversion is taken into
account.

Title:Current Status of the Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession Solution to the Solar Neutrino Problem,"
Abstract:  We discuss the current status of the resonant spin-flavor precession (RSFP)
solution to the solar neutrino problem. We perform a fit to all the latest
solar neutrino data for various assumed magnetic field profiles in the sun. We
show that the RSFP can account for all the solar neutrino experiments, giving
as good fit as other alternative solutions such as MSW or Just so, and
therefore can be a viable solution to the solar neutrino problem

Title:Charged Vacuum Bubble Stability,"
Abstract:  A type of scenario is considered where electrically charged vacuum bubbles,
formed from degenerate or nearly degenerate vacuua separated by a thin domain
wall, are cosmologically produced due to the breaking of a discrete symmetry,
with the bubble charge arising from fermions residing within the domain wall.
Stability issues associated with wall tension, fermion gas, and Coulombic
effects for such configurations are examined. The stability of a bubble depends
upon parameters such as the symmetry breaking scale and the fermion coupling. A
dominance of either the Fermi gas or the Coulomb contribution may be realized
under certain conditions, depending upon parameter values.

Title:Numerical Study of Hawking Radiation Photosphere Formation around Microscopic Black Holes,"
Abstract:  Heckler has recently argued that the Hawking radiation emitted from
microscopic black holes has sufficiently strong interactions above a certain
critical temperature that it forms a photosphere, analogous to that of the sun.
In this case, the visible radiation is much cooler than the central temperature
at the Schwarzschild radius, in contrast to the naive expectation for the
observable spectrum. We investigate these ideas more quantitatively by solving
the Boltzmann equation using the test particle method. We confirm that at least
two kinds of photospheres may form: a quark-gluon plasma for black holes of
mass M_{BH} < 5 times 10^{14} g and an electron-positron-photon plasma for
M_{BH} < 2 times 10^{12} g. The QCD photosphere extends from the black hole
horizon to a distance of 0.2--4.0 fm for 10^9 g < M_{BH} < 5 10^{14} g, at
which point quarks and gluons with average energy of order \Lambda_{QCD}
hadronize. The QED photosphere starts at a distance of approximately 700 black
hole radii and dissipates at about 400 fm, where the average energy of the
emitted electrons, positrons and photons is inversely proportional to the black
hole temperature, and significantly higher than was found by Heckler. The
consequences of these photospheres for the cosmic diffuse gamma ray and
antiproton backgrounds are discussed: bounds on the black hole contribution to
the density of the universe are slightly weakened.

Title:Tau Appearance In Atmospheric Neutrino Interactions,"
Abstract:  If the correct interpretation of the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino
data is \nu_\mu -> \nu_\tau oscillation, the contained data sample should
already have more than 10 tau appearance events. We study the challenging task
of detecting the tau, focussing on the decay chain \tau^\pm -> \rho^\pm ->
\pi^\pm \pi^0 in events with quasi-elastic tau production. The background
level, which is currently quite uncertain because of a lack of relevant neutral
current data, can be measured by the near detector in the K2K experiment. Our
estimates of the background suggest that it may be possible to detect tau
appearance in Super-Kamiokande with 5-10 years of running.

Title:On the Oscillation Length Resonance in the Transitions of Solar and Atmospheric Neutrinos Crossing the Earth Core,"
Abstract:  Assuming two-neutrino mixing takes place in vacuum, we study in detail the
conditions under which the $\nu_2 \to \nu_{e}$ and $\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{e}$
($\nu_e \to \nu_{\mu(\tau)}$) transitions in the Earth are strongly enhanced by
the neutrino oscillation length resonance when the neutrinos cross the Earth
core. We show, in particular, that the neutrino oscillation length resonance is
operative also in the $\bar{\nu}_{\mu} \to \bar{\nu}_{s}$ transitions at small
mixing angles. The properties of the $\nu_2 \to \nu_{e}$ and $\nu_{\mu} \to
\nu_{e}$ ($\nu_e \to \nu_{\mu(\tau)}$) transition probabilities in the
corresponding resonance regions are examined. Some implications of our results
for the transitions of solar and atmospheric neutrinos traversing the Earth
core, relevant for the interpretation of the results of the solar and
atmospheric neutrino experiments, are also discussed.

Title:Large Cosmological Light Element Bound on R Parity Violating Parameters,"
Abstract:  In R parity violating theories, there does not exist the {\it stable}
lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The LSP, $\chi$, of MSSM decays to
lighter ordinary particles with dimension 6 effective R violating interaction
terms. Since the lifetime of $\chi$ can be sufficiently long for small
R-violating couplings, it can affect the standard nucleosynthesis scenario.
This constraint gives an upper limit for the lifetime of $\chi$ in the small
$\tau_\chi$ region; $\sim\tau_\chi>10^6$ s. This translates to the sum of
squared R-violating couplings, for $m_\chi=$ 60 GeV in the photino (bino)
limit, $(0.12 (0.05)|\lambda_{i,j,k}|^2+0.31(0.07) |\lambda^\prime_{i,j\ne
3,k}|^2 +0.04(0.04)|\lambda^{\prime}_{i,3,k}|^2

Title:Cold and Hot Dark Matter from a Single Nonthermal Relic,"
Abstract:  The origin of dark matter in the universe may be scalar particles produced by
amplification of quantum fluctuations during a period of dilaton-driven
inflation. We show, for the first time, that a single species of particles,
depending on its mass and interactions, can be a source of both cold and hot
dark matter simultaneously. Detection of such weakly interacting particles with
masses below a fraction of an eV presents a new challenge for dark matter
searches.

"Title:Strings at the Intermediate Scale, or is the Fermi Scale Dual to the Planck Scale?","
Abstract:  We show that if the string scale is identifed with the intermediate scale,
$M_s=\sqrt{M_W M_{Planck}} \sim 10^{11}$ GeV, then the notorious hierarchy,
$M_W/M_{Planck} \sim 10^{-16}$, can be explained using only $M_c/M_s \sim 0.01
\sim \alpha_{GUT} $ as small input parameters, where $M_c$ is the
compactification scale. This is possible for weakly-coupled Type-I open-string
vacua if the observed world is assumed to live in an N=1 supersymmetric 3-brane
sector coupled to a separate, hidden, 3-brane world which breaks supersymmetry,
because for such a model $M_W/M_{Planck} = 1/2 \alpha_{GUT}^2 (M_c/M_s)^6$. We
discuss some of the phenomenological issues presented by such an
intermediate-scale string, showing that its benefits include:
(i) the possibility of logarithmic gauge-coupling unification of the SM
couplings at $M_s$;
(ii) a natural axionic solution to the strong-CP problem with a
phenomenologically-acceptable Peccei-Quinn scale;
(iii) experimentally-interesting neutrino masses, and more.

Title:R-Invariant Topological Inflation,"
Abstract:  We propose a topological inflation model in the framework of supergravity
with $R$ invariance. This topological inflation model is not only free from the
initial value problem of the inflaton field but also gives low reheating
temperature which is favored in supergravity since the overproduction of
gravitinos is avoided. Furthermore, the predicted spectrum of the density
fluctuations is generally tilted, which will be tested by future observations
on CMB anisotropies and large scale structure of the universe.

Title:Strings with Negative Stiffness and Hyperfine Structure,"
Abstract:  We propose a new string model by adding a higher-order gradient term to the
rigid string, so that the stiffness can be positive or negative without loosing
stability. In the large-D approximation, the model has three phases, one of
which with a new type of generalized ""antiferromagnetic"" orientational
correlations. We find an infrared-stable fixed point describing world-sheets
with vanishing tension and Hausdorff dimension D_H=2. Crumpling is prevented by
the new term which suppresses configurations with rapidly changing extrinsic
curvature.

Title:Black Holes of D=5 Supergravity,"
Abstract:  We discuss some general features of black holes of five-dimensional
supergravity, such as the first law of black hole mechanics. We also discuss
some special features of rotating supersymmetric black holes. In particular, we
show that the horizon is a non-singular, and {\sl non-rotating}, null
hypersurface whose intersection with a Cauchy surface is a squashed 3-sphere.
We find the Killing spinors of the near-horizon geometry and thereby determine
the near-horizon isometry supergroup.
